Its protagonist attends Seven Sisters High School, whose emblem is considered a status symbol, even amongst other schools.  Soon, though, a rumor that Sevens' emblem was actually cursed, and that wearing it would disfigure one's face, had spread around the city. <br><br>Even worse, the rumor came true...<br><br>And it was only the beginning of a string of rumors becoming reality, one after another...<br><br>Before long, the protagonist's party members discover the power to summon another side of them called 'Personas,' which they use to investigate the strange incidents around the city, all while facing their own personal demons as well.  Time is once again on the march... <br>The only Persona game to never see a formal release in North America is finally here, with new quests, refinements, and more! Contact enemy demons to gain items, tarot cards, and vital information only they have.  Negotiate carefully: every demon reacts differently!<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
