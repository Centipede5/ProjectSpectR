Avoid fish-like enemies, conveyer belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more.  Make your way to the end of each level, collecting items and finding along the way.  The deeper in to this dream-like game players venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes.  Along the way, look out for shortcuts and secret exits and unlock bonus levels.<br>It is the elasticity of Umihara\u2019s rubber fishing line that has always set this franchise apart from all other rope games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success and failure. The bungee like nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards.<br><br>Some functions and features may not be available on PlayStation\u00aeTV.<br><br>1 player(s)<br>Network Features<br>1000KB Minimum<br>Touchscreen<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).\u00a0 Online activity subject to Terms of Services and User Agreement (www.sonyenteretainmentnetwork.com\/terms-of-service).
