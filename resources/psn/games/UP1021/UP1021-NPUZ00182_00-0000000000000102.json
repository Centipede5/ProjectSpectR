The ocean's fish are being swept up in fishing nets, and need your help to escape. Slide rows of fish vertically and horizontally to create matches and set the fish free.<br>\r\nAquattack! contains special items, like bombs and electric eels, that can free large numbers of fish, or remove obstacles that prevent rows from being moved.<br>\r\nChallenge Mode takes Aquattack! beyond standard puzzle mechanics to give you specific objectives in each stage, like setting off a chain of bombs in the right sequence, or completing a stage using only red fish.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPublished by Valcon Games.
