Tragically, this reality slowly unwove itself as the spirits lost their influence over this realm. Eventually, all relations were cut between the spirit world and the land of the living. Now, the king of spirits contemplates reforging the time-splintered bonds. He has chosen to send seven spirits to the humble northern town of Moldelvia where they will find a human guide to facilitate their reentry to this plane of existence.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEvergreen Avenue is a unique simulation game where you choose between a male (Catan) or female (Ira) character and help the seven spirits learn the ways of humanity by scheduling special weekly sessions where you play mini games to determine your worth. From time to time, special events will pop up and give you even more opportunity to coax the spirits to join you in your world.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\nDownload this PS one\u00ae Classic today! \r\n<br><br>\r\nTransferring to a PSP\u00ae system from your PS3\u2122 system:<br><br>\r\n<b>You must be signed into the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork account that originally purchased the game.<\/b>  You must have at least 318 MB free on your Memory Stick Duo\u2122.
