Portal\u21222 is now available for digital download with PlayStation\u00aeMove motion controller support along with new motion DLC. <br><br>The single-player portion of Portal\u21222 introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers. Players will explore never-before-seen areas of the Aperture Science Labs and be reunited with GLaDOS, the occasionally murderous computer companion who guided them through the original game.<br><br>The game\u2019s two-player cooperative mode features its own entirely separate campaign with a unique story, test chambers, and two new player characters. This new mode forces players to reconsider everything they thought they knew about portals. Success will require them to not just act cooperatively, but to think cooperatively.<br><br>1-2 players<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p, 1080i<br>Network Players 2-2<br>PlayStation\u00aeMove motion controller and PlayStation\u00aeEye camera optional<br>PlayStation\u00aeMove navigation controller or Wireless Controller optional.<br><br>  This item is being licensed or sublicensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com\/support\/useragreements.
