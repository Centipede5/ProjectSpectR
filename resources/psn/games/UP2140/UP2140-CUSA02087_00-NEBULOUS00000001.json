Arrange the pieces of the puzzle so that when he falls, gravity and momentum guide him safely (and probably painfully) to the end. <br><br>Every level has up to 5 playfields, arranged in a cube. Rotate the level and move the objects in each panel, then release Dash and hope he makes it through to the final wormhole! Deal with unreliable gravity, trampolines, conveyor belts, and other fun inconveniences. <br><br>- Solve a plethora of brain-teasing physics-driven puzzles <br>- Use bouncers, gravity machines, conveyor belts, space rocks, lasers, blocks, blocks, and more blocks (and other stuff) <br>- Guide a powerless astronaut through an absurdly horrific limbo and relish his misfortunes as he questions his sanity in fully voiced dialogue <br>- There\u2019s no such thing as space madness<br><br>PlayStation\u00aeCamera Compatible. <br><br>VR Games may cause some players to experience motion sickness.<br><br>1 player<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>PlayStation\u00aeVR Compatible<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
