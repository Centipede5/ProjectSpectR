Featuring an all new contemporary art style, hand-drawn and presented in HD, complete voice over by members of the original Monkey Island\u2122 franchise cast, a re-mastered musical score using live instruments, plus scene-for-scene hot swap to seamlessly transition between Special Edition and Classic modes at anytime. The game's twisty plot leads our naive hero, Guybrush Threepwood, on a hilarious swashbuckling search for the fabled secret of Monkey Island. Tales of pirate wealth lure him to the port of M\u00eal\u00e9e with high hopes, no money, and an insatiable curiosity. If clever enough, he will win the confidence of M\u00eal\u00e9e's pirates and find himself blown by the winds of fate toward the terrifying and legendary Monkey Island -- an adventure that would chill the bones of even the most bloodthirsty buccaneer.  \n\nLucasArts and the LucasArts logo are registered trademarks of Lucasfilm Ltd. \u00a9 1990-2010 Lucasfilm Entertainment Company Ltd. & \u00ae or \u2122 as indicated.
