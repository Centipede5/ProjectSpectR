Lara Croft embarks on a quest to find the fearsome weapon of Thor, the Norse god of thunder. Legend holds that Thor's hammer had the power to smash mountains into valleys and to destroy even the gods. For more than a thousand years it has existed only as a myth...until now. In an ancient ruin on the floor of the Mediterranean Sea, Lara uncovers proof of the Norse underworld and the mythical hammer. As she attempts to unravel the secrets behind these myths, Lara's perilous journey leads her toward a forgotten power that, if unleashed, could lay waste to all civilization.<br><br>1 player<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).\u00a0 Online activity subject to Terms of Services and User Agreement (www.sonyenteretainmentnetwork.com\/terms-of-service).<br><br>Tomb Raider: Underworld \u00a9 Square Enix Limited 2010.
