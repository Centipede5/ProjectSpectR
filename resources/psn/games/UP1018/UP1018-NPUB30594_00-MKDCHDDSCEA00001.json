When Worlds collide, Heroes and Villains must choose their side and fight as a sinister plot with cataclysmic results unfolds.  Which side will you choose?<br><br>As of May 31, 2014 online matchmaking will no longer function for Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe due to Gamespy removing its online infrastructure and support for a number of titles.  WB Games evaluated a large number of migration solutions, including extensive discussions with the engineering team at NetherRealm Studios. Due to the complexities of supporting the game\u2019s older networking framework, there was no feasible way to integrate a new network layer. This was a very difficult realization for us given the passion we have for the game.  <br><br>Please also note that it might not be possible to obtain all the trophies once the online functionality has been shut down.
