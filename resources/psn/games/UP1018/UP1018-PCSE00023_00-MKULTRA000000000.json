Due to the complexities of supporting the game\u2019s older networking framework, there was no feasible way to integrate a new network layer. This was a very difficult realization for us given the passion we have for the game.  <br><br>Please also note that it might not be possible to obtain all the trophies once the online functionality has been shut down.
