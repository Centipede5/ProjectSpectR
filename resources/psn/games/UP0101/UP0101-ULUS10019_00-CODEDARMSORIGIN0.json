Originally created as a combat training simulator to prepare for an alien invasion, the VR system was shut down during development after a major flaw was discovered. Unbeknownst to its creators, the simulation program continued to evolve on its own, turning into a vast and brutal VR world populated with virtual alien invaders, dangerous computer bugs and the VR system's own security bots. Arm yourself with an assortment of weaponry and battle these enemies through the virtual landscape.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u2022 Multiplayer modes for 4 players<br>\r\n\u2022 Immersive single player mode<br>\r\n\u2022 Weapons and power-ups collected in single-player mode stay with you in multiplayer<br>\r\n\u2022 More than 30 weapons including assault rifles, pulse weapons and rocket launchers<br>\r\n\u2022 Multiple game worlds with randomized levels\r\n<br><br>\r\n1-4 Players<br>\r\nMemory Stick Duo\u2122 160 KB<br>\r\nWi-Fi Compatible (Ad-Hoc) <br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a9 2005 Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. \"KONAMI\" is a registered trademark of KONAMI CORPORATION.
