Your mission is to capture as many different types of aliens as possible from each planet. Steer the spaceship over the terrains, aim its electric rays at the aliens and press the X button to BEAM'EM UP\u2122!  The spaceship has a shield to protect it from its first collision. The craft will be destroyed if it collides again with an alien or when hit by an enemy shot. Hypermode is a combo that gets activated when you capture three aliens quickly in a row. In hypermode, the shield is restored and the beam gets turbocharged. Complete your missions as quickly as possible to win Gold. The power required to capture an alien varies according to its weight and the gravity of the planet that you are flying over. Capture all alien species to unlock the final four missions.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<BR><BR>\r\n\u00a9 2010 Immersive Games Limited. All rights reserved.
