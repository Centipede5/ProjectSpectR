The power of creation is in your hands! In this addictive puzzle game, mix and match different combinations of fire, earth, water and air to create an entire civilization! Of course, the universe was not created in a day.  You'll have to work your way up from a single, simple microorganism to create animals, tools, storms, and even build armies before you have what it takes to build the universe!  But beware, the power of creation may have unintended consequences....inventing the wheel may just trigger a zombie plague! Don't worry, you are not alone on your cosmic journey!  Every time you successfully create a new item you'll be rewarded with the wit and wisdom of some of the greatest philosophers and comedians of all time.
