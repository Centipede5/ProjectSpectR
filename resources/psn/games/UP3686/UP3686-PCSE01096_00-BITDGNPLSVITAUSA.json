You wake up what seems like hours, maybe even days later trapped in a prison cell, and your friend is missing. You find a sword in your cell and vow revenge against the beasts who took your friend - the quest to find your friend one and destroy the demons begins! Explore randomized dungeons and hack and slash your way through dangerous bosses. The difficultly increases as you become stronger and stronger. Build your character how you want with deadly passive abilities. Just like the classic quarter crunchers of old, if you die you lose everything and start all over. Can you make it to the end and save the day?<br><br>Purchasing this content entitles you to both the PlayStation\u00ae4 and PlayStation\u00aeVita versions!<br><br>1 player(s)<br>Ad Hoc Mode 2-99 Players<br>Network Features<br>3226KB Minimum<br>Dual Analog Sticks<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
