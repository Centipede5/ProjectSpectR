Engineer Isaac Clarke is sent to repair the Ishimura's communications array, but he arrives to find a living nightmare-the ship is a floating bloodbath, the crew unspeakably mutilated and infected by an ancient alien scourge. Clarke's repair mission becomes one of survival as he fights not just to save himself, but to return the artifact to the planet ... at any cost.<br><br>\u00a9 2011 Electronic Arts Inc.
