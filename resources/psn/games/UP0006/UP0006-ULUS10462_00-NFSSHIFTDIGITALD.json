Need for Speed\u2122 SHIFT takes players in a different direction to create a simulation experience that replicates the true feeling of driving high-end performance cars.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPlayers are thrust into the experience of racing a car on the edge of control from the driver\u2019s perspective through the combination of perception based G-forces, the hyper reality of the cockpit view, and the brutal experience of a first person crash dynamic. The all-new driver profile is the ultimate extension of the true driver\u2019s experience. This system gives each player a unique persona based on a player\u2019s driving skill and style - aggressive or precise. Driver profile impacts how a player unlocks cars, overall career progression and online matchmaking. In Need for Speed\u2122 SHIFT, how you drive is who you are behind the wheel.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u00a9 2009 Electronic Arts Inc. Trademarks belong to their respective owners.
