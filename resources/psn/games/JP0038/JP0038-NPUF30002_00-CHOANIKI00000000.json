This classic icon of the shooter era created a special place as one of the most outrageous titles in the parody shooter legacy. Deemed too daring for Western markets, in reality, the game is a comic portrayal of over-the-top graphics in a time of over-abundance in the shooter genre. <br><br>\r\nAs you blast your way through multitudes of erotic bodybuilders, spinning corpses and head holes, you\u2019ll find humor and challenge in completing every emphatic level. The game consists of an unending spiral of the weird and wacky. Cho Aniki is tough and will challenge your shooting skills, but in return, you\u2019ll get a constant flow of humor and irony that will make you laugh as you blast your way home. <br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.
