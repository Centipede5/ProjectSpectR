Don't panic! Use your brain first and, if necessary, your sledgehammer.<br>In the '50s Rock'n'Roll music was spawned straight from hell and was so evil that it turned dead people into Zombies!<br> Three survivors - Jack Foster, a construction worker, Foxy Jones, a traffic warden, and Mike Bacon, a perpetually hungry boy scout - have formed an unlikely alliance to protect themselves from the invading undead. Hiding in abandoned buildings, they build blockades, set traps and - as a last resort - use weapons to fight the Zombies.<br> Outlive the Zombie invasion alone or fight with your friends in split-screen cooperative mode.<br><br> \u00a9 2011 Candygun Games UG and Digital Reality.
