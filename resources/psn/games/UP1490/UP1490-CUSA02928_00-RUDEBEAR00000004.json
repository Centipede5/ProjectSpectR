Every time you die, your previous corpses stack up and you can jump on them, push them around and use them as platforms or meatshields. Each death makes the game slightly easier, but it's possible to beat the whole game without dying at all!<br><br>Rude Bear is a gangsta bear from East London who's been summoned back in time to medieval England to defeat his mortal nemesis, The Wizard. Face challenges so lethal, you'll (probably) need to be resurrected thousands of times to stand any chance of winning, and defeat the fearsome Guardians of each world.<br><br>Run, jump and die your way through sprawling levels, facing fiendish challenges across seven diverse worlds, from ancient ruins to convulsing flesh dungeons.<br><br>Online features require an account and are subject to terms of service and applicable privacy policy (playstationnetwork.com\/terms-of-service & playstationnetwork.com\/privacy-policy).<br><br><br>1 player<br>3GB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>Online Play (Optional)<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
