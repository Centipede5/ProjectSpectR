It was old and weighted with sorrow. It hid away three creepy monsters deep down in its heart. It was its secret. Sometimes the monsters wanted to go on a walk. So it had to let them go. They always came back and what belonged together, was then reunited. One day, when the three monsters were on one of their walks, they got terribly lost. What happened on that day is a secret. But let me tell you, it was funny and strange. Sometimes it was even sad and also a little bit scary, all at the same time.
