In either single-player or up to four-player co-op, you will take on the role of Orcs, each wielding a unique gaseous ability, and then take the fight to the Humans in a stinky, fart-filled romp.<br><br>1-4 players<br>4MB minimum save size<br>SIXAXIS Motion Sensitive<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p, 1080i, 1080p<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br>Network Features<br>Network Players 2-4<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
