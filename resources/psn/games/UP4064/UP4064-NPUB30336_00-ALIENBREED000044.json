While influenced by all previous versions of this Data East gem, BurgerTime World Tour elevates retro gaming to the Next-Gen universe. Elemental gameplay and mechanics are kept intact, but the BurgerTime world is transposed onto a much larger canvas.<br><br>BurgerTime World Tour takes platforming to a new plateau with a Rotary Environment System, allowing cylindrical 3D levels to rotate around a center axis and the player to build around the circumference. This system ensures that BurgerTime World Tour becomes a 'new classic' while satisfying the hunger of old-school Burger freaks. <br><br>Four-player action and online play add to the chaos and brings your friends into play.  Four themed environments, four bosses and fifty levels of fun assure a ragin' romp and great value.  Download now and check out why everyone is already online and playing. It's Burgerlicious!<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
