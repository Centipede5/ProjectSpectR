In each level you are given a laser source and its destination. You need to redirect the laser beam from its source to destination using objects like mirrors and prisms. But beware! There are valuable objects in the way, you must work around those objects and not let the laser touch them, else they will explode and you start afresh on that level.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEvery level poses a different difficulty, where you have been given a particular budget to buy objects. You must finish within the given budget and find your way through different obstacles that lay in between the laser and its destination.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere are 90 unique levels with 3 different difficulty modes to test your puzzle skills to deflect the laser to its destination<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a9Gameshastra Inc.
