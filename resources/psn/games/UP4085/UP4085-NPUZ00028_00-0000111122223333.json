The Sanskrit word Chakravigua means Circle strategy where a battalion forms a circle around the king to protect him.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nCircle puzzle is designed in similar fashion. The player\u2019s circles (Blue small circles) are distributed in border of big circle where the objective is to move the blue circle toward zero to conquer it. Defending player\u2019s circles (orange small circles) are distributed around the golden zero where the object is to destroy the all the blue circles. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nMoving the circle around works based on simple logic which described in game mechanics section. The player can destroy the opponent circles using simple math skills like (5+3 =?), (4-2 =?). <br>\r\n<br>\r\nFeatures<br>\r\n\u2022\tThree difficulty modes (Easy, Medium & Hard). <br>\r\n\u2022\t40 levels in each mode <br>\r\n\u2022\t120 total levels <br>\r\n<br>\r\nKey control<br>\r\n\u2022\tDirectional keys is used to move the cursor<br>\r\n\u2022\tThe cursor color will change on rotatable circles. <br>\r\n\u2022\tRight Trigger is used to rotate the selected circle in clockwise direction. <br>\r\n\u2022\tLeft Trigger is used to rotate the selected circle in anticlockwise direction. <br>\r\n\u2022\tTriangle Button is used to restart the button. Conformation window will pop-up on the triangle button press.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a9Gameshastra Inc. All rights reserved.
