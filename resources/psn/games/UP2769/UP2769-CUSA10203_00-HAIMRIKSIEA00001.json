These are the stones in the path Haimrik walks, and he brings them to life as he steps on each one, willingly or not. Haimrik will need to activate the right words to defeat the various enemies that challenge him across numerous Word Worlds, with new puzzles appearing constantly throughout the game.<br><br>Haimrik will undoubtedly die many horrific deaths, leaving pools of red blood contrasting with the otherwise plain monochromatic sepia world.
