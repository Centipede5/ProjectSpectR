But, for the players who feel the guy should be the one who needs saving, we absolutely agree and that\u2019s why Jill is available as a playable character as well! <br><br><br>Features: <br> * 7 worlds made up of 20 levels each<br> * 7 in-game mini-games., where you can earn tickets for the in-game store<br> * In-game store with in-game tickets that are used for unlocking hats and screen colours<br> * Mirror mode<br> * 2 Playable characters<br><br>Purchasing this content entitles you to both the PS4\u2122 system and \u201cPS Vita\u201d system versions!<br><br>1 player(s)<br>1024KB Minimum<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
