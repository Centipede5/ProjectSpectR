It revolves around the idea of finding an opening in your opponent's defense and ending the round with a single, clean hit. Gone are the tedious hit points \u2013 each scratch impairs your movement, every wound might be your last.<br><br>A fighting game that is easily accessible to anyone,each character has a set of intuitive basic abilities and there is no need for memorizing inputs and move-lists. Moves can be canceled to feint an attack, hits can be parried or dodged, and they can clash with one another. This creates a mind-game heavy game-play, one that mimics real samurai showdowns !<br><br>Play as one of the 8 characters, all with their own stories and unique fighting styles.
