The merciless trench warfare offers a unique battlefield experience, immersing you and your squad into intense battles of attack and defense.<br><br>The game takes place on the western front between 1914 and 1918, in one of the bloodiest conflicts in world history. The developers were inspired by the infamous Battle of Verdun in 1916. The game offers 4 distinct game-modes: Frontlines, Attrition, Rifle Deathmatch, and Squad Defense. There are also many historically accurate features such as realistic WW1 weaponry, authentic uniforms, horrendous gore, and maps based on the real battlefields of France and Belgium.<br><br><br>Use of PSN and SEN account are subject to the Terms of Service and User Agreement and applicable privacy policy (see terms at sonyentertainmentnetwork.com\/terms-of-service & sonyentertainmentnetwork.com\/privacy-policy). <br>Online features may be terminated at any time.<br>*Online multiplayer requires a PlayStation\u00aePlus membership.<br><br>1 player<br>Network Players 2-32<br>5GB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>Online Play (Optional)<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
