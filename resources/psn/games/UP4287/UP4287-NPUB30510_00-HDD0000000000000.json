The restricted zone became a Mecca for marauders and criminals who hunted for artifacts and thrills of dead city street racing. <br><br>Outrageous speed, rivers of blood, brutal cars, equipped with instruments of destruction: spikes, saws and blades, and don't forget the boosters. Hundreds of hungry zombies roam the streets, jumping on cars and trying to get to the drivers. To survive there and return to tell the tale is a real challenge.<br><br>1-2 players<br>SIXAXIS Motion Sensitive<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br>Network Features<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
