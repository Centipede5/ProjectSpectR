It is Isaac Newton meets M. C. Escher. Manipulate gravity to redefine the ceiling as the floor while venturing through impossible architectures. Explore increasingly difficult worlds, each uniquely detailed and designed to leave the player with a pronounced sense of intellectual accomplishment. The Bridge exemplifies games as an art form, with beautifully hand-drawn art in the style of a black-and-white lithograph.<br><br>* 48 thought-provoking puzzles, each unique from the rest, all requiring an innovative solution.<br>* Gravity manipulations, gravitational vortexes, parallel dimensions, and many more mind-bending concepts in a world where the laws of physics are not what they seem.<br>* M. C. Escher-esque worlds with impossible architecture set in the style of beautifully hand-drawn black-and-white lithographic art.<br><br>Purchasing this content entitles you to the PS3\u2122 system, PS4\u2122 system, and \u201cPS Vita\u201d system versions!<br><br>1 player<br>10KB minimum save size<br>SIXAXIS Motion Sensitive<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p, 1080i, 1080p<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br>Network Features<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
