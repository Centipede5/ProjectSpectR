When a sphere collides with the chain, it forces its way in at the point of impact. If the fired sphere creates a set of three or more like-colored spheres, then all touching, same-colored spheres are removed.  If any sphere enters the pyramid at the end of the path, you will lose the level and a life! <br>\r\n<br>\r\nPower-ups will drop down if you make three matches in a row. You must catch power-ups before they fall off the playing field or they will be lost. There are instant power-ups and shooter power-ups that you can collect. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThroughout Adventure Mode, you will earn powerful blessings to aid you in your journey. Additionally, you can catch Ankh coins during play, which give you additional lives. Treasures can be collected during play as well\u2014when you eliminate an entire chain of spheres, you will be showered with gems and treasures. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nLUXOR Pharaoh\u2019s Challenge. \u00a92007 Copyright MumboJumbo.
