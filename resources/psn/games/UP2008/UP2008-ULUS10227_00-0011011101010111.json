You must swap adjacent runes to create matches of three or more in horizontal or vertical lines. When matches are made, the runes disappear and any tiles below whose runes break into rocks. Those rocks then drop to the ground below, where they are collected by workers and used as material to build the 7 Wonders. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Story and Free Play modes, the thermometer-style timer on the right of the screen displays the amount of time left to remove all of the tiles and any Cornerstones from the playing field. This must be done before the liquid drains away to complete the current level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn Rune Quest mode, the indicator in the top, left corner of the screen displays how long you\u2019ve been playing the current level. The best time for the level is shown on the left-hand side, along with the number of runes that must be removed to complete the level. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n7 Wonders of the Ancient World. \u00a92007 Copyright MumboJumbo.
