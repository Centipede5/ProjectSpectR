When Zeus, the legendary Greek god, brings you back to life with those famous words, you set forth on a mission to rescue his daughter, Athena, from the wicked God of the Underworld, Hades. To survive the gauntlet of mythological foes, you must hunt down the three-headed wolves that inhabit each stage and collect the Spirit Balls that they release. The Spirit Balls increase your strength and allow you to transform into a variety of forms including a Werewolf, Weredragon, Werebear, Weretiger, and the ultimate form, the Golden Werewolf. Each creature possesses powerful attacks that are required to bring an end to Hade's scheme.<br><br>\u00a9 SEGA. SEGA is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
