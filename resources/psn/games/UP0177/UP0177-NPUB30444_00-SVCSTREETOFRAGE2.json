The next morning, however, Axel received a frantic phone call from Adam's younger brother, Eddie 'Skate' Hunter. Blaze and Axel rushed over and found Adam and Skate's house wrecked and a picture of Adam chained to a wall at the feet of Mr. X. The city was returned to its nightmarish state and criminals were once again running rampant. Unable to contact their old friend in artillery, Axel and Blaze team up with Skate and Max Thunder to free the city and rescue Adam from the Syndicate. It is up to you to take down Mr. X once and for all!\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u00a9 SEGA. SEGA is registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
