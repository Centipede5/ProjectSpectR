The land of Urralia is torn by war. But there is worse: as night falls, you witness the destruction of the world at the hands of a dark God.<br><br>You are granted the power to relive this final day. Lead the investigation and appear alongside characters who played a part in the apocalypse, fight with them or against them, and use your Omensight power to weave a new narrative. <br><br>Through your decisions, your skills and your wits, change the course of the day and, perhaps, pave the way to a brighter future. <br><br>Featuring the top voice acting talents of Patricia Summersett (Zelda: Breath of the Wild) and Julian Casey (We Happy Few, Stories) and a stellar writing team, including Nadim Boukhira (Stories), Genese Davis (The Holder\u2019s Dominion) and Chris Avellone (Planescape: Torment, Pillars of Eternity).<br><br>1 player<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
