Now the people are no longer willing to fight and risk their lives on the battlefield.  A diverse army of battle-hardened android soldiers arise to oppose each other in wars on other peoples' behalf.  It is an era when battles are won or lost on the vast cognitive and combative abilities of their robotic warriors.  A revolutionary new breed of artificial soldier emerges from the never-ending battles.  This autonomous battle android, becomes known as A.D.A.M.  This is his story.  A.D.A.M. begins to question his existence as he struggles and climbs the Tower Purgatory.  Finally overcoming all foes, he emerges victorious at the pinnacle, only to be handed a riveting defeat by one lone remaining Rival.  He once again lands at the base of the tower, but never succumbing to defeat, he strives to reach the tower's core once more in an effort to unlock the secrets of the tower and ultimately, his purpose.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u00a9 2005 HUDSON SOFT.
