The tower is comprised of eight floors, the first seven of which correspond to one of the original Seven Deadly Sins.  A.D.A.M. must purge it of the mechanical scourge hosted inside.  Players progress through the tower's eight uniquely designed floors, utilizing a high-tech arsenal of firearms, explosives and melee weapons to defeat the enemy hordes.  Picking up rare and unique items from fallen enemies, players can use more than 300 unique weapon combinations, strategically choosing different sets of armaments to best dispatch their adversaries.
