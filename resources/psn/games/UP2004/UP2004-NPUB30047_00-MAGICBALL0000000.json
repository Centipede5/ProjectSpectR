Using realistic physics and an advanced system of object destruction, Magic Orbz features PS3\u2122 trophy support and almost 50 levels to demolish and conquer. Smash your way through dozens of colorful and stylized levels including pirate islands amid shark-infested waters, and castles filled with noble knights and courtly ladies. Power up your paddle with special enhancements like cannons and laser attachments. Plus, powerful earthquakes that rock the whole level and fiery meteor showers that rain down from the sky make Magic Orbz a fun, action-packed and engaging experience in single, cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. Magic Orbz is presented in stunning 1080p and its Multiplayer Online game mode supports in-game live voice communications.<br>  <br>Creat Studios, Inc. \u00a9 2008-2009, Creat Studios, Inc.
