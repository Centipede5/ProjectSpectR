Set on a beautiful and tranquil Mediterranean island, the fast-moving, bumper car gameplay style transforms this calm and relaxing setting into a dynamically frenzied raceway. A high-speed mini car racing game with a distinct arcade flavor, gameplay is presented from the unique perspective of a small RC vehicle, setting out to conquer the big world. Players will enjoy realistic driving physics and suspension as the tiny vehicles interact with full-size people and other beach dwellers along their path to victory.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n TikGames, LLC. \u00a9 2008, TikGames, LLC.
