In the game world, to fulfill the competition's 'Anything with an Engine!' motto, the contestants race the most insane vehicle designs created by Jimmie\u2019s world class crew from some of the most unlikely of everyday objects \u2013 such as tubs, coffins, lawnmowers. Each vehicle is equipped with nitro, and custom front missiles, rear mines, and hydraulic rams - the event\u2019s signature combat mechanism. All of these devices are activated and upgraded throughout each race by showing off driving skills and winning the favor of the crowds who cheer on and cast their votes to provide power-ups to the racers. Enter Jimmie's El Cajon Arena and engage in various race and elimination-style events across progressively more challenging tracks, decked out with pyrotechnics-laden theatrical sets and strewn with wicked hazards, traps, and jumps!<br><br>1-8 players<br>41KB minimum save size<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br>Network Features<br>Network Players 2-8<br><br>  This item is being licensed or sublicensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com\/support\/useragreements.
