Now the star is beginning to collapse into a black hole, pulling our stranded fleets to their doom. To make things worse, our warring neighbors have deployed scavengers to prey upon our people. Only one craft is capable of a rescue mission, the Quarp Jet - a spacecraft capable of teleportation. Take control of the world\u2019s first quantum teleport craft in this innovative shooter, using a range of teleport controls to outsmart enemies, solve action puzzles and rescue survivors from their deep space hideaways. Featuring genre-busting game play and music from Joris de Man (Killzone), Velocity plays like a dream and sounds incredible!<br><br>  Purchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement and this item's use restrictions.
