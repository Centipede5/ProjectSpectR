The game is an arcade romp through 8 stages where you have to complete 10 levels in each stage.  The gameplay is fast and furious but the complexity is intuitive and the feel is responsive.  So the game comes off refreshingly fun and original.  Its addictive action and minimal frustration blends with a creative building element that pulls you in.  Like potato chips, once you start you won\u2019t want to stop.<br><br>\r\nTall Unlimited was originally published by Techno Soleil and developed by Open Sesame in 1999.  The game was published first in Japan and later made into a North American release in 2002, called Tall Infinity.  This version is the original Japanese version, hence the original name.<br><br>\r\nDownload this PS one\u00ae Classic today! <br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.
