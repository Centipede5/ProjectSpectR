The game has solid control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system. With six stages, it\u2019s not the longest game on the block, but the massively scaling 2D backgrounds and variable difficulty make up for that. <br><br>\r\nBut the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The technique and effects used will give shooter aficionados a work of art to go back to for multiple exposure. The soundtrack stands out for its techno\/ambiance mood and is adds to the subliminal nature of the work. The effects and twists in the game will have you on your edge. Thoughtfully presented and wonderfully executed, GaiaSeed is a PS one\u00ae game console gem. The game is very rare and can be found on online auction sites in the $150 range.<br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.
