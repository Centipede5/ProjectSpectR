This vertical scroller combines features of previous versions (I-III) and delivers a mind-bending, finger-happy splurge through shooter heaven.  Sonic Wings features 2-player same-screen simultaneous play and a choice of multiple jet fighters.  Pick from 7 teams and fourteen pilots flying high in twenty-six different jets.  Each captain is detailed out in anime graphics so you get a real feel for your co-pilot.  There are 17 stages with multiple paths in which to choose while levels can be randomly served.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nWho wouldn\u2019t want to play Captain Blaster Keaton while battling the enemy Fat Morgana?  This is a quintessential fighter from a great era of gaming history.
