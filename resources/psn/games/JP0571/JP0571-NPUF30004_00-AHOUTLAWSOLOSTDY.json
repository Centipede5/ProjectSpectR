But what separates the game from others is its hand-to-hand combat play. If you wish to throw down your weapon and fight like a man, you\u2019re efforts will be paid off in more visceral attacks and better combos. This is a nice flight from others in the genre as it adds a twist where you may not expect. <br><br>\r\nOutlaws of the Lost Dynasty is standard 2D fighting fare with quarter circles, charge moves, combos, and special moves. Like most Data East fighters, the depth lies in the linking together of standard and special attacks, and pulling off what air juggling is possible within the system. The character animation in this series is particularly smooth and fluid for the time, and while it\u2019s certainly not a modern fighter, it holds up surprisingly well. \r\n<br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.
