And did we mention the angry condescending Russian robotic teddy bear or the unhinged albino corn stalk with an underbite?

You may uncover a little something about yourself exploring the mysteries of MAIZE! Or not. <br><br>FEATURES<br>* Immerse yourself in MAIZE\u2019s fully-realized (and extremely odd) environment.<br>* Engage with a colourful cast of characters. <br>* Solve puzzles that get more and more silly the further you explore.<br>* Try and figure out what it is the corn really want, aside from a very good nap.<br><br>1 player<br>4GB minimum save size<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
