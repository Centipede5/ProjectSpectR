After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure. The game brings back the 90's-era platformer with a game inspired by classics like Commander Keen, Conker, Ruff'n'Tumble & Jazz Jackrabbit.  <br><br>Features<br>Weapons: Dusty arms Rad with seven radical weapons.<br><br>Sounds & Music: Andrew Hulshult has created an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers!<br><br>The Pixelverse: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists beyond the game world.<br><br>Classic Easter Eggs: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. <br><br>1 player<br>9GB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
