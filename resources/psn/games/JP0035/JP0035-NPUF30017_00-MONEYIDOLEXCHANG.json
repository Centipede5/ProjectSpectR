Money Idol Exchanger is exactly this genre but with some Idol love to help you through the maze.  With names like Mightdealer, Debtmiser, Everyworker, and Cherrybiter, the girls are of that special Japanese flavor with lots of cuteness.<br><br>\r\nBut the game\u2019s quality comes through on the two-player versus mode. Like all the great drop games, the intensity of the battle mode is where a game makes its grade and this game performs like scholar.  The fact that you have to do some addition while you\u2019re burning your buddy makes the victory somehow sweeter.  Not only are you a better player, you\u2019re smarter too!<br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.  Although text is limited, it is in the original Japanese language.
