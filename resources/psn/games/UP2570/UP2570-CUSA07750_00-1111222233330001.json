There are Strigas and Baba Yagas aplenty, but there are no heroes, no monster slayers, and no great armies capable of banishing them. You have only a few hopeless and starving survivors who are desperately trying to stay alive. You are their last and only true hope! <br><br>The game combines turn-based strategic game play with the tension and grit of a rogue-like, a captivating story you can uncover through a series of in-game events, and a unique combat system based on a complex card battle game. <br><br><br>1 player<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
