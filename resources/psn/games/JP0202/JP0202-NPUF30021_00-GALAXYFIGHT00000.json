The game\u2019s visual effects will amaze with up to five layers of parallax scrolling. Developed by Sunsoft in 1995 for the arcades, the game was brought to the consoles with near perfection.  <br><br>\r\nLegend has it that once every 1000 years, a being of divine power takes physical shape somewhere in the galaxy. This time, he has taken form on the planet Danius. He who calls himself \"Felden Crayce\", is being sought out by fighters across the galaxy to challenge until death.<br><br>\r\nBe sure to experiment with each fighters' special moves\/combos. Each character has an 'Instant Death Move' that will finish off the opponent. The playfield will scroll endlessly in either direction. There are bosses other than Felden...you may get a code to play as them.<br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.
