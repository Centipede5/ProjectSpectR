Exploit the enemy\u2019s weaknesses with superior positioning and flanking manoeuvres to inflict devastating damage.<br>Six classes of assaults ships are yours to command. Make precision strikes with the swift Swordfish Raiders, or lead from the bridge of a hulking Kraken Dreadnought. <br>The nautilid threat is as varied as it is innumerable, however, and they will not surrender. Use your wits to overcome the threat of disruption fields, bio-missiles and proximity mines.
