Long ago, these four CPUs engaged in a war for supremacy known as the War of the Guardians. However, this war weakened their protective hold on the world inhabited by their people, and in turn it was flooded by monsters under the influence of an individual known as Arfoire.<br>During the War of the Guardians, one of the CPUs\u2014Neptune\u2014was defeated by the others and hurled down to the world\u2019s surface from the heavens. The drop caused Neptune to lose her memories, as learned by Compa and IF, who happen upon the fallen girl. A mysterious book containing knowledge of all Gamindustri\u2019s history suddenly speaks out to Neptune, Compa, and IF. With the assistance of this sentient book, the trio embark on an extraordinary journey across four different nations on a quest to save the entire world!<br><br>Some functions and features may not be available on PlayStation TV.<br><br>1 player(s)<br>51200KB Minimum<br>Touchscreen<br><br>  This item is being licensed or sublicensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com\/support\/useragreements.
