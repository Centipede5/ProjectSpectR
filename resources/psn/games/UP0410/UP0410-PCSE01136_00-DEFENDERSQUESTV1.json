That means no random encounters, no spikey-haired emo kids, no forced time sinks, and no tedious, repetitive battles.<br><br>The battle system builds off of tower defense, with individual characters taking the place of towers.  Each character levels-up, learns skills, and equips gear individually, allowing the player to customize their battle experience and strategy.  The overall game structure is similar to 'tactical' RPG's, but with a real-time battle system.  Game speed is adjustable, and commands can even be issued while the game is paused.<br><br>It also features an engaging, character-driven story written by an actual English major! The story strives to be fast-paced, snappy, and always relevant to gameplay with minimal exposition.<br><br>Purchasing this content entitles you to both the PS4\u2122 system and \u201cPS Vita\u201d system versions!<br><br>1 player(s)<br>5120KB Minimum<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
