Space Salvager, are you up for the challenge? A high action arcade style space shooter with infinite levels of play. Use a combination of 4 weapons, and high maneuverability to dodge, weave, and blast your way to the next level. In each level of play you will eliminate enemy ships, weave your way through astroid fields, and outsmart a boss ship. Collect special weapons, shields, debris orbs(points), and multipliers along the way to improve your chances to get a high score.\r\nFor added challenge the game can be played in \"classic mode\" as classic side scroller, or get in the middle of all the action in \"action mode\".\r\n<br><br>\r\nCheck www.twisteddragon.com and join our forums for information and to contribute on design decisions for upcoming games.\r\n<br><br>\r\nCopyright 2010 Twisted Dragon Media, LLC.
