With features like 360\u00b0 shooting range, unique scenarios to discover, exploration modes to analyze the environment, a powerful shield, and different upgradable Combat Modes, you must defend the Technocratic Republic of Ekron, but be careful, for dark secrets await and the limits between right and wrong will slowly fade.
