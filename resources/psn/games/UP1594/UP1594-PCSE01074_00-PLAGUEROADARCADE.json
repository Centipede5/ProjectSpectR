Travel from the safe refuge of your farm through a series of regions progressively more affected by the infernal plague. <br><br>On the road, rescue survivors and choose whether to use them as traveling companions or to improve the Doctor's farm and gain access to new abilities. How your farm progresses depends upon where you assign survivors to work. <br><br>Some survivor types are more valuable in certain jobs, but may be more useful still if kept available for expeditions. Surviving the road will rely on your ability to fight horrors created by the plague, in combat encounters featuring grid-based positioning and turn-based strategy mechanics.<br><br>Traverse four regions with procedurally generated stages, featuring richly illustrated 2D art, directed by Luc Bernard.<br><br>Network Players - 2<br>1000KB Minimum<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
