Hordes of violent monsters roam the outskirts of town, a long-dormant volcano has suddenly become active again, and the new lord of the land has been taxing the citizens heavily. As Adol and Dogi begin to search for the sources of Felghana\u2019s recent struggles, they find each clue leads them more and more towards the disturbing conclusion that these events are all somehow linked. <br><br>Play as Adol in this re-imagining of the classic third game in the Ys series. A fully explorable 3D world with added voice-overs on all story-advancing scenes, an overhauled battle system for stream-lined play, and a rearranged soundtrack that builds upon the critically-acclaimed original music are just some of the features that bring this classic up to modern standards.
