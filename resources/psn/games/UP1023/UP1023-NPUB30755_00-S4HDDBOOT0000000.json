Amihama, a harbor city long known for its fishing industry and abundance of taverns, has become a robust trading town filled with Westerners since the forced opening of the country\u2019s ports. The town is now filled with European-styled buildings, which hint at a new era for Japan, but many locals still harbor a deep resentment toward the sudden influx of foreigners. <br>     Meanwhile, foreigners confined to living in a specially designated district claim discrimination, while the official shogunate Japanese forces clash against vigilante isolationists and foreigners alike, each fighting for their beliefs and way of life. Into the mayhem arrives a lone samurai, and the actions he takes and the allegiances he forms will change the course of the nation.<br><br>1 player<br>2MB minimum save size<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br>Network Features<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
