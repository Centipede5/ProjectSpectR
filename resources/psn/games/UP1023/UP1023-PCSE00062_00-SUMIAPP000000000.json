Only one man could stop him: an adviser to the former chancellor named Tengan. But Seimei anticipated this challenge and had Tengan condemned to prison forever. With no other recourse in sight, Tengan elected to free a sleeping Sumioni, or Inkdemon, named \u201cAgura\u201d at the cost of his own life, bequeathing this creature a compulsory mission through the scorched ruins of Japan to defeat Seimei and wrench order from chaos.<br><br>Guide Agura through 2D side-scrolling levels and unleash his powers by drawing brush strokes on the touchscreen.
