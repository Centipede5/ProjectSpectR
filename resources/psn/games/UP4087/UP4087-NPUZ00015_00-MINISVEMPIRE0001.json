Defeat the other monster lords and conquer their lands. \r\nVEMPIRE is a puzzle game in which you have to rotate blocks to create rows or columns of 4 of more blocks of the same type. Delete enough blocks before the time runs out to complete a level.\r\nBlocks can be of various types. Some are meaningless blocks; others represent mana energy of different colors or money. Money collected during the game can be spent in the shop to buy new creatures to summon during the game. \r\nDoing mana combos the player can summon creatures that will help the player delete the blocks or tackle the big bosses. The game features 6 different creatures.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the 40 game levels you will be able to unlock artefacts. These artefacts give you various powers, like slowing down time or turning the blocks into mana. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEach game world is owned by a boss monster. This monster will appear every once in a while and will cast a nasty spell against you making the game harder.\r\n<br><br>\r\nVEMPIRE \u00a9 2009 developed and published by Impressionware Srl.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
