Dishonored and stripped of his powers, War must return to Earth to search for the truth and punish those responsible. But there is no clear definition of good and evil in this tale. Hunted by a vengeful group of angels, War must take on the forces of Hell, forge uneasy alliances with the very demons he hunts, and journey across the ravaged remains of the Earth on his quest for vindication. But the answers he seeks will reveal a deep conspiracy in which War will find, and have to resign himself to the reality that although once the hand of God, he is just a pawn in the eternal battle between heaven and hell.<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).\u00a0 Online activity subject to Terms of Services and User Agreement (www.sonyenteretainmentnetwork.com\/terms-of-service).<br><br>\u00a9 2011 THQ Inc.
