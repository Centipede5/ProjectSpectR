A separatist faction of Marauders-intent on wiping out the Martian colonists-has destroyed the terra-formers and sparked a decade-long war that has rendered the planet's surface uninhabitable.  Forced to rebuild their society underground, the colonists cling to whatever hope for survival they can find.  <br><br>Deep inside the planet, an ancient alien stronghold is uncovered... and Armageddon is unleashed.  A vicious alien race-locked away for millennia-will stop at nothing to cleanse the planet of life. As demolition expert Darius Mason, the grandson of Alec Mason who defeated the Earth Defense Force years ago, the Red Faction looks to you as leader, defender, and salvation. Harness the destructive powers of the Nano-Forge to transform the world into your weapon and bring it crashing down upon your enemies. The fate of Mars lies with you.<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
