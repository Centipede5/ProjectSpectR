It follows the story of a fragile little fur creature and its desperate attempt to rescue its mate from the clutches of a pack of malicious predators. The journey to the heart of a mysterious forest soon becomes a savage and merciless fight for survival as everything in this mesmerizing but deadly environment wants to eat you. <br><br>The vivid world of Feist is brought to life by a highly dynamic and emergent gameplay. All elements interact with each other and produce unpredictable interactions. Enemies are armed with a complex AI and chase the player with the physical intensity of wild beasts \u2013 reminding him of how small he is. <br><br>Feist's tension is emphasized by an enchanting and melancholic Score and a cinematic style reminiscent of Jim Henson\u2019s 'The Dark Cristal' (1982), Yuriy Norshteyn\u2019s 'Hedgehog in the Fog'. (1975) and Maurice Sendaks 'Where the Wild Things Are' (1963).<br><br>1 player<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
