Liberty City worships money and status, and is heaven for those who have them and a living nightmare for those who don't. Niko is looking to escape his past and make a new life for himself in the land of opportunity. Johnny, a veteran member of The Lost biker gang, is caught in the middle of a vicious turf war with rival gangs for control of the city. Luis, part-time hoodlum and full-time assistant to legendary nightclub impresario Tony Prince (a.k.a. 'Gay Tony'), is struggling with the competing loyalties of family and friends in a world in which everyone has a price. Their lives cross paths with devastating consequences as they fight to survive in a city torn apart by violence and corruption.\r\n<BR><BR>\r\n \t\u00a92006-2010 Rockstar Games.
