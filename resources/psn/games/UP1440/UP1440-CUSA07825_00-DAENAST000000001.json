Choose your approach when infiltrating mighty castles, snowy mountain monasteries or hidden forest camps. Set traps, poison your opponents or completely avoid enemy contact.<br><br>The group is composed of very different personalities. Working together as a team seems impossible at first. Yet over the course of many missions, trust is won and friendships are made. The characters develop their own dynamic and each member will have to face their own personal demons.<br><br>The player has to carefully evaluate his options in order to master the challenging missions: how will the characters behave as a team? Which one is best equipped for each task? How can they best master the given missions? Come up with your own ingenious tactics to vanquish enemies and complete missions.<br><br>Remote Play requires PS Vita system and sufficiently robust Wi-Fi connection.<br><br>1 player<br>10GB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>Remote Play<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
