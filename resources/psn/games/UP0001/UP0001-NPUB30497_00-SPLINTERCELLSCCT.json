Fresh from the East Timor operations, Sam Fisher is now put on the front lines of information warfare. The world is suffering from citywide blackouts, stock exchange sabotage, and electronic hijacking of national defense systems. In East Asia, a U.S. battleship is sunk by a North Korean missile, resulting in a War between North Korea and USA. Fisher, who through seemingly unrelated events has discovered the existence of a group named Displace International, is sent to the Korean peninsula to investigate if the North Korean claims are true. Fisher not only discovers that Displace International is behind the war but is working with the Japanese Information Self Defence to plot World War III. Fisher must stop this plot at any cost and prevent global Armageddon. Integrated 3D stereoscopic views take the action into the third dimension with 3D-enabled TVs.\r\n\r\n\u00a9 2010 Ubisoft Entertainment. All Rights Reserved.
