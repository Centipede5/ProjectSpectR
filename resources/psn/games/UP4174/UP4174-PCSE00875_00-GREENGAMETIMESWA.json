You are a master of time. You can set it to past, present and future. Use this power to help a mechanical bird complete its important mission of gathering the knowledge about a mysterious green world. This is not an easy task, as the bird moves on its own, and you cannot stop it. Control time to activate and deactivate various mechanisms, to make sure the bird reaches the cage without dying. The game features fifty carefully designed levels. You will need to make your way through a hostile world - the blades of windmills will slice the bird, pistons shall squash it and spiked gates are going to crush it. Control time to deactivate traps and activate the steam generators that will change your movement direction. Find one of many ways to the end of each level. Plan your route and show your reflex skills to get through the most difficult paths and gather all the gears.<br><br>1 player(s)<br>2KB Minimum<br>Touchscreen<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
