The lights are on, and the front door is opened. But, the windows are all boarded up and the grass is overgrown. It seems like a strange place to deliver a pizza, but at least, it looks like someone is home. <br><br>You run to the front door since it\u2019s storming pretty bad. <br><br>\u201cHello!? Your pizza's here!' You announce. No one answers. There's an eerie silence. <br><br>You are getting soaked from the rain, so you hesitantly step inside the door and look around. The front door suddenly closes behind you. <br><br>You just wanted to finish this last delivery and head home for the night. Now you must figure out how to get out of this stupid creepy house. <br><br>Freely roam the house and try to figure out what is going on. Three dolls and a strange girl named Emily will also start roaming the house as the hours toll by. Stay away from them, but if you do end up in a room with one, figure out how to stay alive. <br><br>This may be your last pizza delivery.<br><br>1 player<br>2GB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
