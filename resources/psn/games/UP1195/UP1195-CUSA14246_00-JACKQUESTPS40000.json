Forced to mount a rescue, Jack plunges into Korg\u2019s underground base, where he happens upon a strange blade that becomes an unlikely ally. In JackQuest, players will explore the cavernous depths of Korg\u2019s slime-ridden, labyrinthine lair. There, they will solve environmental puzzles, discover power-ups, collect weapons, and challenge subterranean foes, including massive bosses. Acquire many useful upgrades and power-ups by purchasing them from strategically placed merchants.  You'll want to spend your coins wisely and save for more expensive items that can prove to be life savers later on. Gain many powerful weapons such as swords, bow and arrows, and jumping boots. Learn special abilities including wall jumping, lightning speed boosts and using magic crystal power to perform a devastating winding windmill attack!<br><br>1 player<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
