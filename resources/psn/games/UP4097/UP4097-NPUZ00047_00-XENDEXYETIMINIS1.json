For the first time, this mismatched couple is taking off on the PSP\u00ae (PlayStation\u00aePortable) system. After being smashed around for years Pengu finally gets to fly!\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn 'Level Mode' use the X button to get Pengu to jump from the cliff top and time Yeti's swipe of the bat to launch him in the air. Fly Pengu with the directional buttons, analog stick or L button and the R button and guide him through 27 stages of all new level gameplay. Chase the Albatrosses to steal their fish or swoop low over the ice to pluck your catch and boost your score. Do you have what it takes to get you name in the High-score table?!\r\n<br><br>\r\nThere is also 'Classic Mode' where your goal is to get Pengu to glide further than any other penguin has ever done.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThat\u2019s 2 modes, 9 levels and 27 stages!\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter 5 years the web version is still being played by up to 100,000 gamers per day! With tons of new features this new PSP\u00ae (PlayStation\u00aePortable) system version is setting out to be the most addictive handheld version of the YetiSports series yet!","macross-brain-context":"game","media-list":{"preview":[],"promo":{"images":[{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/8\/85a52b6e1d2db926f8b94b5189dead9b81cca501-74153.png"},{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/5\/55d841be6d5147078e35d098e6cea6f506095193-74154.png"},{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/a\/ad3da360f6139c4299f61ace8b547d44cd996871-74155.png"},{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/0\/0a8a6afed8826833b4334e162bbb3d273adb3432-74156.png"},{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/2\/23a2df4eb7202c57c9e3440625543530e8c6fc59-74157.png"},{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/d\/d2a9bd6ac91a14164b829ce0eef795150cbf8df0-74158.png"},{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/5\/5827a8c6b24678b338f34884633abfe8a6a20bc5-74159.png"},{"url":"https:\/\/nsx.np.dl.playstation.net\/nsx\/material\/8\/83d070cbff23efafdf9002b3ca176d7851864998-74160.png"}],"videos":[]},"screenshots":[]},"name":"YetiSports","nsx-confirm-message":"","parent":null,"platforms":["PS3","PSP"],"plus-reward-description":null,"primary-classification":"DOWNLOADABLE_GAME","provider-name":"XENDEX HOLDING GMBH","ps-camera-compatibility":"incompatible","ps-move-compatibility":"incompatible","ps-vr-compatibility":"incompatible","release-date":"2010-06-15T00:00:00Z","secondary-classification":"MINIS","skus":[{"entitlements":[{"duration":0,"exp-after-first-use":0}],"id":"UP4097-NPUZ00047_00-XENDEXYETIMINIS1-UG01","is-preorder":false,"multibuy":null,"name":"7.7 MB Required","playability-date":"","plus-reward-description":null,"prices":{"non-plus-user":{"actual-price":{"display":"$4.99","value":499},"availability":{"end-date":null,"start-date":null},"discount-percentage":0,"is-plus":false,"strikethrough-price":null,"upsell-price":null},"plus-user":{"actual-price":{"display":"$4.99","value":499},"availability":{"end-date":null,"start-date":null},"discount-percentage":0,"is-plus":false,"strikethrough-price":null,"upsell-price":null}}}],"star-rating":{"score":3.76,"total":42},"subtitle-language-codes":[],"tertiary-classification":"NA","thumbnail-url-base":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/store\/api\/chihiro\/00_09_000\/container\/US\/en\/999\/UP4097-NPUZ00047_00-XENDEXYETIMINIS1\/1520436148000\/image","top-category":"downloadable_game","upsell-info":null,"voice-language-codes":[]},"id":"UP4097-NPUZ00047_00-XENDEXYETIMINIS1","relationships":{"children":{"data":[]},"legacy-skus":{"data":[{"id":"UP4097-NPUZ00047_00-XENDEXYETIMINIS1-UG01","type":"legacy-sku"}]}},"type":"game"}
