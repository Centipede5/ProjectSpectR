Inspired by the wildly popular 80's arcade series, all new 1942: Joint Strike combines classic top-down vertical shooter gameplay with updated 3D HD graphics and online play. Skillfully maneuver your aircraft to take on massive waves of incoming enemy fire while ducking and dodging explosions and missiles! Face off with huge enemy bosses in death-defying dogfights. Recruit a wing man locally or online to work together and pull off new \u201cJoint Strike\u201d attacks, combining the powers of both aircraft in one explosive barrage. With new weapons and power-ups in your arsenal, prepare to rejoin the battle!<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\u00a9 CAPCOM CO., LTD. 2008, \u00a9 CAPCOM ENTERTAINMENT, INC. 2008 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PLAYSTATION\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
