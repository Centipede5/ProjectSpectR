The player plays one of the five major ancient empires: Rome, Greece, Egypt, Persia, or Carthage. By annexing new territories, the player gradually expands his power over the world! <br><br>But Tiny Token Empires is also a 'casual' strategy game that doesn't take itself too seriously. It contains a crazy comical universe: goofball gods, super cute mythological monsters, clown legionnaires, etc.<br><br>- 6 campaigns: one per nation and an exclusive Mythological one.                                 <br>- 5 nations, 5 heroes, 25 generals and 50 kinds of units!                             <br>- 5 kinds of puzzles to get through battles, digs, events and more.                                 <br>- 3 difficulty levels that offer a new challenge every time.                                 <br>- 4 game modes (solo and multi) to make the fun last even longer!<br><br>1-2 players<br>904KB minimum save size<br>HDTV screen resolution: 720p, 1080i, 1080p<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae3<br>Network Features<br>Network Players 2-2<br><br>  This item is being licensed or sublicensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com\/support\/useragreements.
