Control your character through funky-fresh stages and do battle with outrageous, heavy metal bosses!\r\n<br><br>\r\nFeatures:<br>\r\n1.) Audio Dynamics: Notes you play in Riff Combos are in tune with the current key of the stages' songs, allowing you to play along with the action.<br>\r\n2.) Facial Attribute System: A fun and visual way to interpret riff combos. For example, if there are three eyes and two tentacles on an enemy, you have to \"strum\" three of the same notes and two same other note in the riff combo. When a note is played in the air, a Riff Combo will be activated to help defeat enemies.<br>\r\n3.) Online Leaderboards: The scores from each level played are posted on online leaderboards. Keep playing for the highest score and beat the competition!<br>\r\n4.)
