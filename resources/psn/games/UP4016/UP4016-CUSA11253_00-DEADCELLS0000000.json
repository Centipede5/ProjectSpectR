Immortal but crippled, your last resort is to take over bodies in order to move, explore\u2026 and fight.<br><br>While you may well be immortal, the corpses you possess are not. Each time your host is destroyed, you will be sent back to the dungeon to find yourself a new one and start again...<br><br>Experience a Roguevania, mixing an interconnected world, branching paths and unlockable skills with the constant adrenaline-pumping threat of permadeath.  No checkpoints. You either vanquish the final boss in one go or you try again. However, you keep some of your progress for successive runs new paths you\u2019ve unlocked, access to new levels, mutations, abilities and weapons.<br><br>Tough but fair combat, responsive controls, challenging foes, and of course, the emergency panic roll to get you out of trouble make for a visceral and cathartic action game.<br><br>Remote Play requires PS Vita system and sufficiently robust Wi-Fi connection.<br><br>1 player<br>1GB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>Remote Play<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
