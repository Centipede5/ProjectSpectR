All I had to do was collect some samples from a contaminated area under the sea. As soon as I left the ship, everything went wrong. Communications were lost and my submarine crashed on the ocean floor. I survived, but my oxygen is running low and I can't contact anyone for help. All I can do is move forward with this operations drone as my only companion. Trouble is, it's been acting sort of weird lately. Almost as if it's trying to sabotage my mission... <br><br>Anoxemia is a story-driven exploration game that puts you in control of the scientist Dr. Bailey and his operations drone, ATMA. Search the ocean floor as you discover and extract samples from the bowels of the underwater caves.

Fortunately, ATMA can help guide you to your destination using.<br><br><br>Additional hardware required for Interconnectivity.<br><br>1 player<br>5GB minimum save size<br>Interconnectivity PS4\u2122 \u2022 PS Vita<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
