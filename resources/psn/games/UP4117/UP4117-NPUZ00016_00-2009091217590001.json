Fence off parts of the battlefield to corner your enemies. Collect catapults and power-ups to besiege the fortresses and take on dragons. But beware! As you progress through the levels it gets harder and harder. The fortresses become much larger and the monsters more vicious. Can you emerge victorious and reclaim the land of your ancestors? You are the knight Fortix, the sole hope for the desolate and tortured land of Fortiana to become the fertile land that it was before.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBeware, this game is addictive!
