Players control Knight Fortix, as he attempts to take back the land of Artalom from the evil mage Xitrof.  During his quest, the player will have to assist Sir Fortix from his base line (or safety line) as he runs across the shires, boxing-off terrain to recapture it, while simultaneously running through a maze of relentless projectiles and aggressive enemies. Capturing dragons, outwitting ogres and vanquishing hordes of bats is all in a day's work. Catapults and power-ups will aid the player in their quest. But, even these great countermeasures can only do so much. Sometimes, the only thing standing between you and glory is a white knuckled mad dash to the other side!\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nAll rights reserved Nemesys Games 2011\r\n<BR><BR>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
