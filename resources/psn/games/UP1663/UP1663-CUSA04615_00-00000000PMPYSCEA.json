Joined at the waist, you and your partner share a long, wriggling body as you wrestle your opponents for control of the ball. Since you're sharing the same body, you'll need to carefully communicate (or just shout a lot). With every action affecting both you and your partner, PMPY combines the best parts of co-op multiplayer with the worst parts of your last breakup.  <br><br>\u2022 Frantic local multiplayer gameplay in the vein of Sportsfriends or Towerfall.  <br>\u2022 Compete in multiple game types that will test your friendship in different ways, or play around in a sandbox area filled with toys and secrets.  <br>\u2022  Low on controllers? Share a controller with a friend or try controlling two heads simultaneously - a two-player game can be played with just one controller!   <br>\u2022 Accessible yet deep - play it as a noisy party game or hold a fiercely competitive grudge match. <br><br><br><br>Additional hardware required for Remote Play.<br><br>2-4 players<br>300MB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>Remote Play<br>1080p HD Video Output<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
