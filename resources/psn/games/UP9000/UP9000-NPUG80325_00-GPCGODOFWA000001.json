But long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the Gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary. The Ghost of Sparta is now ordered by the Gods to journey the underworld, after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek Mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\"God of War is a registered trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. \u00a9 Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc. \"PlayStation\", \"PS\" Family logo, and \"PSP\" are registered trademarks of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc.
