You are in command of four soldiers (broken into two smaller fire teams), and you're able to issue commands to either team, an individual soldier or all four guys at the same time. Players must manage the placement of their men in the Set-Up mode, then carry our orders in the live Execute mode -- each stage is a critical part of getting the job done and getting every soldier out alive.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and this item's use restrictions.
