Players must guide the two cartoonish, bunny-like characters (Cookie and Cream) through parallel courses that usually scroll from the top of the screen.As the characters run side by side up their individual tracks, they often come to obstacles that block the path for one or both of them. In cooperative games, the character on one side can help clear the obstacle for his partner by manipulating objects on his or her side of the screen.The Adventures of Cookie and Cream is designed to be an immediate, lighthearted title suitable for casual gaming and multiplayer parties. \u00a92000, 2001 From Software, Inc.
