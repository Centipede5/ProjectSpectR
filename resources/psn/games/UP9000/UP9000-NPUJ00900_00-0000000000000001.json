Many centuries have passed since the war of the Magi. Civilizations have been rebuilt with iron, machines and technology. For years the Espers have existed only in ancient legends. Now an Esper has been discovered and the forces of magic are beginning to return. The risk of another, more devastating war is about to surface. Featuring all-new CG cinematic sequences exclusive to this edition, discover the origins of special features later developed in subsequent FINAL FANTASY\u00ae titles, including summoning magic, mini quests, the Active Time Battle system and much more.
