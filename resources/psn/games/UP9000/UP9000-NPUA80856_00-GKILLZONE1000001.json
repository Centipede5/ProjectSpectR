Together with a hot-headed sergeant named Rico, a deadly Shadow Marshal known as Luger, and the half-human, half-Helghast spy Hakha, Templar must attempt to reactivate the Orbital Defense Platform and drive the invading forces from his planet Vekta.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis rip-roaring introduction to the Killzone\u2122 universe has been remastered in HD. Featuring a single-player campaign with four playable characters and an offline multiplayer mode against AI opponents, Killzone\u2122 HD has received a thorough audiovisual overhaul: the game boasts 720p graphics at a steady 30fps, with MSAA filtering, sharper textures and higher quality sound effects. \r\n<br><br>\r\nThis item is being licensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com\/support\/useragreements.
