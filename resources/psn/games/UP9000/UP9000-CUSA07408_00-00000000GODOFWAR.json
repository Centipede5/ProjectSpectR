Living as a man outside the shadow of the gods, Kratos must adapt to unfamiliar lands, unexpected threats, and a second chance at being a father. Together with his son Atreus, the pair will venture into the brutal Norse wilds and fight to fulfill a deeply personal quest.<br><br>\u2022\tBold New Beginning \u2014 His vengeance against the Gods of Olympus years behind him, Kratos now lives as a man in the realm of Norse Gods and monsters. It is in this harsh, unforgiving world that he must fight to survive\u2026And teach his son to do the same. This startling reimagining of God of War deconstructs the core elements that defined the series\u2014satisfying combat breathtaking scale and a powerful narrative\u2014and fuses them anew. <br>\u2022\tA Second Chance \u2014 Kratos is a father again. As mentor and protector to Atreus, a son determined to earn his respect, he is forced to deal with and control the rage that has long defined him while out in a very dangerous world with his son.<br>\u2022\tA Darker, More Elemental World \u2014 From the marble and columns of ornate Olympus to the gritty forests, mountains, and caves of Pre-Viking Norse lore, this is a distinctly new realm with its own pantheon of creatures, monsters, and gods. With an added emphasis on discovery and exploration, the world will draw players in to explore God of War\u2019s breathtakingly threatening landscape\u2014by far the largest in the franchise.<br>\u2022\tVicious, Physical Combat \u2014 With an over the shoulder free camera that brings the player closer to the action than ever before, fights in God of War mirror the pantheon of Norse creatures Kratos will face: grand, gritty, and grueling. A new main weapon and new abilities retain the defining spirit of God of War while presenting a vision of violent conflict that forges new ground in the genre.<br><br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
