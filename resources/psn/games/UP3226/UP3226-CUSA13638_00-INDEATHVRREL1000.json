Battle deep into the Afterlife to restore Harmony. Engage in intense ranged combat with your weapon of choice and ever more powerful loot. Challenge other players to scale The Ladder, in asynchronous multiplayer mode. <br><br>Inspired by classic Roguelike dungeon crawlers, In Death pays homage to this merciless genre. Each procedurally generated run uses a random seed to generate the map and enemy spawns. Game progression is driven by an achievement system that persists across each run and scales the difficulty level in lockstep with your mastery of the game.<br><br>Upgrade your bow with a host of special arrows gained by looting monsters, pick-ups or by visiting item stores where you can power up with a range of intense special arrows to help you blast through ever harsher enemy encounters.<br><br><br><br><br>Online features require an account and are subject to terms of service and applicable privacy policy (playstationnetwork.com\/terms-of-service & playstationnetwork.com\/privacy-policy).<br><br><br>1 player<br>6GB minimum save size<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>Online Play (Optional)<br>PlayStation\u00aeVR Required<br>PlayStation\u00aeCamera Required<br>Enhanced play with 2 PS\u00aeMove controllers<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
