Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.<br><br>Figure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.  Use optional motion controls to grab things and press buttons. Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a DUALSHOCK\u00ae4 controller.<br><br>It's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator!<br><br>1 player<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>PlayStation\u00aeVR Required<br>PlayStation\u00aeCamera Required<br>Enhanced play with 2 PS Move controllers<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).

The fate of the world is in your hands.<br>Gameplay revolves around four major tenets:<br>- Immersion with Comfort. First-person VR shooters are not normally a good idea due to presence-breaking sickness. However, we think we\u2019ve conquered it by utilizing a new technique integrated into our drones. A first-person VR shooter has never felt this good.<br>- Intense battles. Individual aliens are not much of a threat, but everything changes when alien families are protecting their beloved nests.<br>- Replay Value is king. The game is a highly replayable, arcade-style shooter with random elements in four distinct scenes that will keep you coming back for more.<br>- Leaderboards.
