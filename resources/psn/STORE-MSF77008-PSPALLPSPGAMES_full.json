Once the player reaches the top of the skyscraper, the player\u2019s objective is to grab the runner of a waiting helicopter for even more bonus points!\r\n<br><br>\r\nThis title is a Japanese Import.

Tragically, this reality slowly unwove itself as the spirits lost their influence over this realm. Eventually, all relations were cut between the spirit world and the land of the living.

The fate of this world hangs in the balance as the barrier protecting it is severely weakened. The gods granted power to six rings to form the world's barrier and located them in a tower known as Dragon's Fang. Dark priestesses planned on destroying the barrier for so they could summon their Demon King. When they tried to destroy one of the rings, the barrier weakened greatly, but the remaining five rings scattered themselves across the ends of the realm to prevent further damage to the shield. With the shield weakened, monsters of increasing power and ferocity began appearing throughout the lands. You must join the search among other adventurers of Halodra Illa and find the five rings and restore balance to the world!<br><br>Some functions and features may not be available on PlayStation TV.<br><br>  This item is being licensed or sublicensed to you by Sony Computer Entertainment America and is subject to the Network Terms of Service and User Agreement, this item\u2019s use restrictions and other applicable terms located at www.us.playstation.com\/support\/useragreements.

Millennia ago, the lands were ravaged by mysterious beings known only as \"Angels.\" And in the time since, though people have inched their way back toward civilization, they are still far from civilized. Mankind still fights over anything and everything, from money, to power, and even simple pride. It is in this war-torn climate that the Angels have re-emerged to finish what they started. Join the enigmatic Crevanille and his friends as they attempt to solve the conundrum that threatens to wipe out their existence. Along the way, marvel at the stunning artwork by Satoshi Urushihara, challenge yourself with an engaging battle system, and uncover over 40 different endings all while managing to save the world from darkness! Often hailed as the best game in the beloved Growlanser series, this long-awaited chapter of the saga is not to be missed.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u00a9 INDEX Corp. 2012, Published by ATLUS\r\n<br><br>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.

The downtrodden people of the Empire came together to rise against those who oppressed them. Led by the hero Ricardo Raguel, the resistance group Esperanza stormed the capital and faced the might of the Empire's military, hoping to create a new world based on freedom and equality. That resistance failed utterly. Ten years later, what little remains of Esperanza hides in the worst of the nation's slums. They are merely thieves hiding under the cloak of political activism, and even Giulio Raguel, son of the now-dead hero, has become disillusioned of any chance of seeing a life outside of the filth and racism in the Empire. However, when a valuable prisoner falls into Esperanza's hands, a new chance to fight returns... along with a magical weapon that declares that its destined wielder has the opportunity to fight for everything his heart desires--or destroy everything in the attempt.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u00a9 Index Corp. 2012, Produced by ATLUS, Developed by STING.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.

However, this is not your typical desert as there is plenty of water that separates land masses. Mecho Wars features a unique day-night cycle where water will freeze overnight allowing once inaccessible areas reachable in the early hours of the morning.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThe day-night cycle isn't used only in the single player campaign. Try facing off against a friend in multi-player. Be amused when you place your troops in the right spots for an overnight ambush!\r\n<br><br>\r\nCreat Studios, Inc. \u00a9 2011, Creat Studios, Inc.

But what separates the game from others is its hand-to-hand combat play. If you wish to throw down your weapon and fight like a man, you\u2019re efforts will be paid off in more visceral attacks and better combos. This is a nice flight from others in the genre as it adds a twist where you may not expect. <br><br>\r\nOutlaws of the Lost Dynasty is standard 2D fighting fare with quarter circles, charge moves, combos, and special moves. Like most Data East fighters, the depth lies in the linking together of standard and special attacks, and pulling off what air juggling is possible within the system. The character animation in this series is particularly smooth and fluid for the time, and while it\u2019s certainly not a modern fighter, it holds up surprisingly well. \r\n<br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.

The game has solid control, precise bullet collision, and a simple powerup system. With six stages, it\u2019s not the longest game on the block, but the massively scaling 2D backgrounds and variable difficulty make up for that. <br><br>\r\nBut the real beauty of GaiaSeed lies in its subtlety. The technique and effects used will give shooter aficionados a work of art to go back to for multiple exposure. The soundtrack stands out for its techno\/ambiance mood and is adds to the subliminal nature of the work. The effects and twists in the game will have you on your edge. Thoughtfully presented and wonderfully executed, GaiaSeed is a PS one\u00ae game console gem. The game is very rare and can be found on online auction sites in the $150 range.<br><br>\r\nPlease Note: This game is a direct import from Japan.

Acting as the leader of a territory from the Egyptian Empire, players manage all aspects of its rise, from economic growth to political power, the development of armies, and expansion into other regions by war and diplomacy. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEmpires are controlled from three main views: the Campaign Map shows the entire game world, including mountains, forests, coastlines, oceans, rivers, cites, and armies. The City Map gives players an overview of the structure and role of a city within the empire, and provides a basis for economic decisions. The Battle Map is to be used when diplomacy has run its course or when a city is being attacked, resulting in turn-based combat. \r\n<br><br>\r\nAll nations, cities and armies were carefully researched to ensure historical accuracy. The game is accessible for new users, while offering deeper gameplay for expert players.\r\n<br><br>\r\nPublished by Slitherine Software UK Ltd \u00a92010. All Rights Reserved.

And now you\u2019ve woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico and you can\u2019t remember a thing. Lost and on your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you\u2019ve got at getting home. But once you\u2019re in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot.

Delete enough blocks before the time runs out to complete a level.\r\nBlocks can be of various types. Some are meaningless blocks; others represent mana energy of different colors or money. Money collected during the game can be spent in the shop to buy new creatures to summon during the game. \r\nDoing mana combos the player can summon creatures that will help the player delete the blocks or tackle the big bosses. The game features 6 different creatures.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIn the 40 game levels you will be able to unlock artefacts. These artefacts give you various powers, like slowing down time or turning the blocks into mana. \r\n<br><br>\r\nEach game world is owned by a boss monster.

When there are one or more colored square panels on the battle grid, it means an element  can affect that area.  The effect can boost or reduce your unit's stats.\r\n<br><br>\r\nGeo Cube - A new addition to the PSP\u00ae version, Geo Cubes are magic items that add more depth to multi-player battles.  You can use the various Geo Cubes to enhance your abilities, summon monsters, or even attack your enemies with them. \r\n<br><br>\r\nDemon Gadgets - Are randomly generated items that appear on the battlefield.  By acquiring these gadgets, you can power your units up.  Some demon gadgets can level your unit up by 30 levels at once.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nTransmigration - A form of reincarnation that allows you to start over from level 1, but your unit will grow stronger than before.\r\n<br><br>\r\n\u00a92009 NIPPON ICHI SOFTWARE INC.

The all-new driver profile is the ultimate extension of the true driver\u2019s experience. This system gives each player a unique persona based on a player\u2019s driving skill and style - aggressive or precise.
