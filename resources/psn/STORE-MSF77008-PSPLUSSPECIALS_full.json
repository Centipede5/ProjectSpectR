entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets...all from the comfort of your elevator.<br><br>Floor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and re-imagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.<br><br>Figure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.  Use optional motion controls to grab things and press buttons. Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a DUALSHOCK\u00ae4 controller.<br><br>It's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator!<br><br>1 player<br>DUALSHOCK\u00ae4<br>PlayStation\u00aeVR Required<br>PlayStation\u00aeCamera Required<br>Enhanced play with 2 PS Move controllers<br><br>  Software subject to license (us.playstation.com\/softwarelicense).
