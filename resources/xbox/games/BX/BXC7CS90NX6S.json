Things can get really interesting if your chief scientists develops alcoholism after one too many long nights in the lab.\n \n\u00b7 Futuristic Space Dome construction: Retro-futuristic super structures housing colonists, factories and commercial buildings with their own \u201cneighborhood personality.\u201d Create colonies that value science over everything else, while tired workers drink their pay away at a local bar, or attempt a utopia among the stars. \n \n\u00b7 Exploration of Mars\u2019 secrets:  Inspired by the classic sci-fi of Asimov and Clarke, Surviving Mars holds many secrets. During each playthrough players may encounter one of Mars\u2019 individually crafted mysteries. Uncovering these secrets might bring your colony great fortune, or terrible ruin. \n \n\n\u00b7 Randomized research tree: Combine static and random research through exploration, which allows for a different experience for each journey through the game. Attain new scientific breakthroughs by exploring the uncharted terrain of Mars's surface.\n\n\u00b7 Unique retro-futuristic aesthetic: A sleek, modern take on the bright futurism of the 1960s.
