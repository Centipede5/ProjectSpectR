These will be utilised to build new modules, weapons, clones and tools.\n\nYou can join the harvester crew on planet surfaces and discover additional loot and secrets.","SkuTitle":"Genesis Alpha One","Markets":["JP","PT","DE","BR","GB","FR","IT","ES","AT","IE","HK","IN","SA","SG","ZA","AE","TR","CH","SE","NO","FI","DK","NL","BE","IL","CZ","PL","HU","SK","GR","AR","CL","CO","KR","CA","MX","US","RU","CN","AU","TW","NZ","Neutral"]}],"MarketProperties":[{"FirstAvailableDate":"2019-01-29T00:00:00.0000000Z","RedemptionUrl":"https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/redeem","Markets":["US"]}],"ProductId":"BQ3KRVCCLBVZ","Properties":{"HasThirdPartyIAPs":false,"BundledSkus":[],"DisplayRank":[],"FulfillmentType":"XUS","InstallationTerms":"InstallationTermsRestrictiveXbox","LicensingPolicyType":"Online","Packages":[],"SkuDisplayGroupIds":[],"SkuDisplayRank":1,"LastUpdateDate":"","VisibleToB2BServiceIds":[],"AdditionalIdentifiers":[],"IsTrial":false,"IsPreOrder":true,"IsBundle":false,"IsRepurchasable":false},"SkuASchema":"SKU;3","SkuBSchema":"SkuGame;1","SkuId":"0003","SkuType":"Full","RecurrencePolicy":null,"SubscriptionPolicyId":null},"Availabilities":[{"Actions":["Details"],"AvailabilityASchema":"Availability;3","AvailabilityBSchema":"AvailabilityGame;1","AvailabilityId":"FKMC7H44TBRV","Conditions":{"ClientConditions":{"AllowedPlatforms":[{"PlatformName":"Windows.Xbox"}]},"EndDate":"9999-12-29T23:59:59.9999999+00:00","ResourceSetIds":["1"],"StartDate":"0001-01-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"},"LastModifiedDate":"2019-01-29T10:02:24.0000000+00:00","Markets":["US"],"Properties":{"OriginalReleaseDate":"2019-01-29T00:00:00.0000000Z"},"SkuId":"0003","DisplayRank":0,"AlternateIds":[]}]}]}
