It\u2019s also about friendship, family and fun. Join Max and S.T.E.V.E. as they adventure across the galaxy battling the baddies and saving the day. Boss 101 is an arcade shooter and much more! We have procedurally generated levels, bosses and gameplay. On top of that we\u2019re bringing you as much humor and entertainment as possible while you play.\r\n\r\nWe made Boss 101 as a complete story. We hope you enjoy EVERY part of the game but here are recommendations depending on your play style:\r\n\r\nStyle 1 I want it all Type:  I want the whole Boss 101 experience: Awesome! Listen to BERL\u2019s tutorials, explore the Command Center and don\u2019t skip those cutscenes! Also, collect all the gophers, and be sure to make dolphin friends BEFORE level 30 if you want to see something special. Answer your phone, check out the WIKI, get a pet and visit ROB regularly in the Command Center! There are extra secrets for those that finish all quests as well as purchase all the hats \u2013 good luck!\r\n\r\nStyle 2 No Tutorials but Story is fine Type: Turn off the tutorials and head around the Command Center. Try not to skip the cutscenes and answer the Command Center phone! Otherwise \u2013 explore the Command Center and have fun!\r\n\r\nStyle 3 All Action\/Skip Cutscenes Type: If you can\u2019t stand cutscenes. If tutorials bore you then we recommend you turn tutorials off (the game will ask you) and explore the Command Center discovering things. You can skip cutscenes but we don\u2019t recommend it. We do recommend checking the Endless Boss mode if you just want all out arcade action. Let\u2019s be clear - you will be missing out on a lot of the story and world we made but hey, you want to play your way.\r\n\r\nThank you again for checking us out and we would love to hear about
