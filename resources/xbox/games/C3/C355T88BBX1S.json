for Speed Payback","ProductDescription":"Need for Speed\u2122, one of the world\u2019s bestselling video game franchises, returns with a vengeance in the new action-driving blockbuster, Need for Speed Payback. \n\nSet in the underworld of Fortune Valley, you and your crew were divided by betrayal and reunited by revenge to take down The House, a nefarious cartel that rules the city\u2019s casinos, criminals and cops. In this corrupt gambler\u2019s paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins. Play a varied and challenging world of events as Tyler; the Racer, Mac; the Showman and Jess; the Wheelman. Each driver must take on races, missions and challenges to earn the respect of the Valley\u2019s underground and compete in the ultimate race to finally take down The House. \n\nYour car is at the centre of everything you do. Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles. Go head-to-head with other racers on or off-road through canyons, deserts, mountains, and the city. Raise the stakes by putting down additional in-game currency on all events, challenges and missions that can multiply your winnings. But you could lose it all. Finally, for ultimate bragging rights, connect and compete via Autolog recommendations with your friends and, for the first time, with potential rivals. Your leaderboard will populate with other players of similar skill level so you can see how you rank around the world.\n\nFrom insane heist missions to devastating car battles to jaw dropping set piece moments, Need for Speed\u2122 Payback delivers an edge of your seat, adrenaline-fueled action-driving fantasy.\n \nKEY FEATURES\n\u2022 Scrap to Stock to Supercar: Your car is at the centre of everything you do in Need for Speed Payback. Endlessly fine-tune your performance through each of the five distinct car classes: Race, Drift, Off-Road, Drag, and Runner, to turn the tables on the competition in any race, mission, or challenge. Find abandoned derelict cars scattered throughout the world to build your perfect car from the ground up. Collect, win, or buy the hottest after-market parts and craft multiple cars into the perfect driving machines.\n\n\u2022 Live out an action-driving fantasy: Play through an explosive, action-packed adventure as three distinct playable characters united by one common goal: revenge. Tyler, Mac and Jess team up to even the score against all odds, and enter the ultimate race to take down The House. Battle cops with ever-increasing intensity, race against rivals across the city, and drive on and off-road through mountains, canyons, and desert.\n\n\u2022High stakes competition: Get on a roll and win big with all-new Risk vs Reward gameplay. The return of intense cop chases means the stakes have never been higher. Put your reputation on the line and challenge your friends or potential rivals via Autolog recommendations throughout the campaign events or go head-to-head in classic online leaderboards.\n\nConditions and restrictions apply.

In this corrupt gambler\u2019s paradise, the stakes are high and The House always wins. Play a varied and challenging world of events as Tyler; the Racer, Mac; the Showman and Jess; the Wheelman. Each driver must take on races, missions and challenges to earn the respect of the Valley\u2019s underground and compete in the ultimate race to finally take down The House. \n\nYour car is at the centre of everything you do. Craft unique rides with deeper performance and visual customization than ever before. Push them to the limit when you narrowly escape the heat in epic cop battles. Go head-to-head with other racers on or off-road through canyons, deserts, mountains, and the city. Raise the stakes by putting down additional in-game currency on all events, challenges and missions that can multiply your winnings. But you could lose it all. Finally, for ultimate bragging rights, connect and compete via Autolog recommendations with your friends and, for the first time, with potential rivals. Your leaderboard will populate with other players of similar skill level so you can see how you rank around the world.\n\nFrom insane heist missions to devastating car battles to jaw dropping set piece moments, Need for Speed\u2122 Payback delivers an edge of your seat, adrenaline-fueled action-driving fantasy.\n \nKEY FEATURES\n\u2022 Scrap to Stock to Supercar: Your car is at the centre of everything you do in Need for Speed Payback.

Find abandoned derelict cars scattered throughout the world to build your perfect car from the ground up. Collect, win, or buy the hottest after-market parts and craft multiple cars into the perfect driving machines.\n\n\u2022 Live out an action-driving fantasy: Play through an explosive, action-packed adventure as three distinct playable characters united by one common goal: revenge. Tyler, Mac and Jess team up to even the score against all odds, and enter the ultimate race to take down The House. Battle cops with ever-increasing intensity, race against rivals across the city, and drive on and off-road through mountains, canyons, and desert.\n\n\u2022High stakes competition: Get on a roll and win big with all-new Risk vs Reward gameplay.
