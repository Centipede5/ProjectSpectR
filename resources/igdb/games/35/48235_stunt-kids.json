Two human players can compete head to head, or a computer can control the second player, as the kids race dirt bikes through increasingly difficult obstacle courses whilst collecting power-ups. The dirt bikes can jump and lean and the player needs to take advantage of the bike's abilities in order to avoid being thrown clear.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,11253,15851,55752,34919,55715,36608,16468,14713,8674],"tags":[1,268435470,536870969,536872078,536875073,536875079,536875098,536875130],"category":0,"keywords":[57,1166,4161,4167,4186,4218],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k1puk7nzqrekacyuggws.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k1puk7nzqrekacyuggws","width":400,"height":550}}
