The player gives orders to the population of their settlement: to collect resources, dig out mines, construct buildings and workshops, craft equipment and weapons, set up farms and the like. This plays out in real time as these orders are carried out, with the player reacting to disasters \u2013 natural or otherwise.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55689,29173,18623,55590,44242,26628,54996,31515,34823,17130],"tags":[17,268435471,536870972,536872060,1073741827],"developers":[11237],"game_engines":[369],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[60,1148],"themes":[17],"genres":[15],"status":2,"pulse_count":2,"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"zEJzpqwkavo"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tjdonhotwaynqvfhv9oj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tjdonhotwaynqvfhv9oj","width":1920,"height":821},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/kingunderthemounta.in\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RocketJumpTech"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/kingunderthemountaingame\/"}]}
