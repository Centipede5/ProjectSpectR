Sensible Soccer 2006 returns with a modern take on its trademark zoomed out camera and truly intuitive control system, which delivers total 360-degree control over your players' kicks and movement. Visually, the game has a distinctive new graphical style, which includes cel-shaded players with the classic enlarged heads, designed to appeal both to fans of the series and appeal to a new generation of gamers. The trademark top-down view allows you to see the build up play better than you can in any current football game. This gives the player a huge degree of tactical awareness and control that has never been bettered.","collection":4702,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[10121,4643,27081,38865,54662,80676,1992,19459,72711,47093],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536872078,536872622,536875258,536875433,536875531,536875562,536875682,536875749,536876252,536876259,536876528,536877432,536878090,536878109,536878125,536880353,536884018,536884032],"category":0,"keywords":[26,1166,1710,4346,4521,4619,4650,4770,4837,5340,5347,5616,6520,7178,7197,7213,9441,13106,13120],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1152403200000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1152403200000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Jul-09","y":2006,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Championship Soccer '94","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mau2vkyexx0e4cco4djb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mau2vkyexx0e4cco4djb","width":258,"height":313}}
