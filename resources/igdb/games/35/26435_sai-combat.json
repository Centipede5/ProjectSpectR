The difference from standard karate is the presence of a large stick for each player, which is used to inflict much of the damage. Your challenge in a one-player game is to progress through the Belts and Dans, by winning every fight. Each hit scores you points depending on how tough a maneuver it is deemed to be- three hits must be impacted to move up a level. A player's energy level, or Chi, is depicted by a white dragon turning green or red as weakened.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[41828,10039,22418,7100,65832,19333,36911,55752,2558,68391],"tags":[1,268435460,536870973,536871019,536871244,536871577,536872649,536874688,536874706,536875075,536875200,536875459,536875482,536875486,536875892,536876303,536877184,536880994,536880995,1073741828],"publishers":[4119],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[61,107,332,665,1737,3776,3794,4163,4288,4547,4570,4574,4980,5391,6272,10082,10083],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y4ixludg6aiax0p8mobz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y4ixludg6aiax0p8mobz","width":1000,"height":1251}}
