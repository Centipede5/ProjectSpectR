If you touch any robot then you lose one of three lives but you are armed with a laser. Two joysticks can be selected with one controlling your movements while the other joystick controls your fire direction. Humans also wander around the screen and these can be collected for bonus points.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,306,103298,68287,90099,105269,55038,87728,27011,103020],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871835,536894003,1073741827],"publishers":[11506],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[923,23091],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kubknbpr7e5efnjdzloa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kubknbpr7e5efnjdzloa","width":160,"height":100},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pjxbx51336bdvi0yjspt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pjxbx51336bdvi0yjspt","width":160,"height":100}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aqubxfnqlxpx8rsczfgg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aqubxfnqlxpx8rsczfgg","width":160,"height":100},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/www.mobygames.com\/game\/cybotron"}]}
