In that time, the shape of the world has changed dramatically. The power to destroy civilization rests in the hands of the superpowers and now, as either the president of the U.S. or as the General Secretary of the U.S.S.R., you have total responsibility for your nation's course. To succeed, you must enhance your country's prestige without infringing too much on your adversary's interests. If you play the isolationist, you will find yourself alone in a world dominated by your opponent. If you are too aggressive, you could unleash the war that annihilates humankind- and both sides lose. \n \nBalance Of Power uses a huge statistical database, a meticulously detailed display of the world, and advanced artificial intelligence techniques to put you in command of one of the world's superpowers. You have vast amounts of information available as you press your country's interest and resist the pressure of the other side. Noted game designer Chris Crawford has created a model of the world which will entertain, educate, challenge, and perhaps frighten you in ways no computer game has ever done before. \n \nCovers the eight years from 1986 to 1994.","collection":1863,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9760,55029,2015,36594,12982,22399,18623,24512,55036,6985],"tags":[22,39,268435471,268435480,536871126,1073741827],"publishers":[489,1743],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[214],"themes":[22,39],"genres":[15,24],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[63,14,13,16,75,53],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":567907200000,"region":2,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":567907200000,"region":2,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":53,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oammtijami6hzo0jatpz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oammtijami6hzo0jatpz","width":640,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s31n9av7suzli0061i6h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s31n9av7suzli0061i6h","width":280,"height":192},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ttgxgifjhptkfmgidzyc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ttgxgifjhptkfmgidzyc","width":280,"height":192}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x6aw08jh2ylq5uya9ujp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x6aw08jh2ylq5uya9ujp","width":744,"height":884}}
