{"id":1635,"name":"The Spy Who Loved Me","slug":"the-spy-who-loved-me","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/the-spy-who-loved-me","created_at":1351020996650,"updated_at":1515648616747,"summary":"James Bond: The Spy Who Loved Me was Domark's penultimate Bond game, and is widely considered to be a rip-off of the arcade classic Spy Hunter. Both titles feature gadget laden cars in a vertical-scrolling racing and shooting game. The problem with The Spy Who Loved me is the bad controls, and the low production values. For instance, the boat sections have a little map to indicate where ramps and dead-ends are, but they are sometimes incorrect, causing frustrating deaths. On the plus side, the graphics and music are good on the Amiga and Commodore 64 versions.","collection":326,"franchise":37,"franchises":[37],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[23175,37022,55289,59516,13189,25222,25646,55803,42080,41895],"tags":[1,268435487,536871939,1073741827,1073741828],"developers":[879],"publishers":[880],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1027],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":631152000000,"platforms":[63,13,16,15,26,25,64],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631152000000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":1},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":631152000000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":1},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":631152000000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":1},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631152000000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":1},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":631152000000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":1},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":64,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/trdtenalaiyexy2pxqej.jpg","cloudinary_id":"trdtenalaiyexy2pxqej","width":640,"height":400}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nzopwimvvt7icnbrjchg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nzopwimvvt7icnbrjchg","width":464,"height":640}}
