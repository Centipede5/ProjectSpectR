Thanks to the dynamic camera technology, you\u2019ll get the best view of the action and the camera won\u2019t miss a single flick pass, slide-tackle, or short dribble. All of this combines to make the game feel like a live broadcast. \n \nIf realism is not what you are looking for, or if the refs keep rewarding your play with red cards, then switch from the Simulation mode to Arcade mode. With fewer rules and faster play, Arcade mode creates a wide-open game with lots of scoring. ADIDAS POWER SOCCER \u201998 provides enough action to keep both fans and casual observers of soccer engrossed in the world\u2019s most popular sport.","collection":4861,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[43743,15851,103377,106814,30830,100359,65118,25962,27081,20302],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536872078,536875054,536875073,536875433,536875623,536876259,536877432],"category":0,"keywords":[26,1166,4142,4161,4521,4711,5347,6520],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":901756800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":901756800000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jul-30","y":1998,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rxriveeajf922vk4i5vb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rxriveeajf922vk4i5vb","width":1446,"height":1477}}
