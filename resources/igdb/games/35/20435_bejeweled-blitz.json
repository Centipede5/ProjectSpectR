It developed into a downloadable game, based on the then-in-development Bejeweled 3 engine, due to popularity of the differences from Bejeweled 2 and its new graphics. As with the Bejeweled series, Bejeweled Blitz is based on the Shariki game mechanic. It is the fourth game of the Bejeweled franchise and initially was available on iOS as part of the Bejeweled 2 iOS application, later on with the standalone iOS application.","collection":368,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":50,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[25222,18167,54678,8197,6732,26223,17354,13163,60044,28113],"tags":[268435465,536871645,536871878,536872205,536873064,536873787,536875046,536875379,536875658,536876217,536876435,536876568,536876856,536881123,536881831,536883171],"category":0,"keywords":[733,966,1293,2152,2875,4134,4467,4746,5305,5523,5656,5944,10211,10919,12259],"genres":[9],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Bejeweled Blitz Live","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tw08ga6aiiotxq05bwtv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tw08ga6aiiotxq05bwtv","width":400,"height":225},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
