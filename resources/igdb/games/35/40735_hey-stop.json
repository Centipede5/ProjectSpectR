Stop! is a clone of the game Keystone Kapers, originally developed by Activision. The game is for the most part exactly the same except for a few color and sprite changes. In Hey! Stop!, you are not playing as a policeman, trying to chase down a thief but you instead play as a droid chasing down an alien (despite the fact that the box art displays a picture of the former).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}]}
