Set in the land of Uld - a fantasy world arising from the ashes of an epoch-long war of darkness - players assume the roles of fantasy heroes as they explore, adventure, and quest through entirely randomized dungeons and environments. With an elegant point-and-click interface and an accessible \"isometric\" perspective, Mythos is poised to have near-universal appeal.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":43,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":43,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[47823,36926,23198,26766,1911,18822,12632,19698,19333,29147],"tags":[1,268435468,536871139,536871208,536871301,536871812,536872245,536872328,536873297,536875095,536875169,536875361,536875407,536875455,536875738,536875897,536876036,536876057,536876252,536876546,536876550,536876560,536876704,536878240,536878421,536880694,536882128,536883035],"category":0,"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[227,296,389,900,1333,1416,2385,4183,4257,4449,4495,4543,4826,4985,5124,5145,5340,5634,5638,5648,5792,7328,7509,9782,11216,12123],"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1306368000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1306368000000,"region":8,"human":"2011-May-26","y":2011,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xfpoyxsprvppaggt9jdy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xfpoyxsprvppaggt9jdy","width":540,"height":768},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mythos_(video_game)"}]}
