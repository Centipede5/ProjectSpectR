Many of the same features from other baseball games are present and has three different game modes to choose from: exhibition, playoff, and home run derby, but what makes this version different from the others is a lack of MLB license, though it does feature a MLBPA license with top players of the time such as Roger Clemens, Otis Nixon, Bobby Larkin among many others.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[30],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":30,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}]}
