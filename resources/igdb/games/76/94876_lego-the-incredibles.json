Players traverse environments, solve puzzles, and battle enemy thugs and villains. Players punch, kick, and use superpowers (e.g., ice blasts, eye lasers) to defeat enemies in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by impact sounds, explosions, and slow-motion effects; enemies burst into Lego pieces when defeated. The game includes instances of crude humor: bird dropping smeared across a car's windshield; characters burping and vomiting.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game was rated PEGI 7 for non-realistic violence in a child-friendly setting or context.
