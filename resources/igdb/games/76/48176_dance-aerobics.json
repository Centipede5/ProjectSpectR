To succeed the player must press the pads with their feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.","collection":3762,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,11253,15851,48232,34919,55715,36608,16468,14713,54662],"tags":[1,268435470,536871689,536872078,536873064,536875350,536875939,536876100,536876348,536880762],"category":0,"keywords":[777,1166,2152,4438,5027,5188,5436,9850],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Family Trainer: Aerobics Studio","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lvvylwhmx38qvakf5oed.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lvvylwhmx38qvakf5oed","width":1521,"height":2099}}
