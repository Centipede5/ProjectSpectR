Okie Dokie is a fast moving puzzle game that challenges you with 30 preset puzzles and 435 random puzzles. It seems simple enough, turn off all of the squares. Well, there's a catch! Every time you select a square, it gets \"flipped\" -- if it was on it turns off and visa versa. To complicate things further, any square directly to the left, right, above, or below the square is also \"flipped.\"","popularity":1,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"keywords":[1617,3782],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":833673600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":833673600000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Jun-02","y":1996,"m":6}]}
