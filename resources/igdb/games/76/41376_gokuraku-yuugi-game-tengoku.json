Most are based around gambling. \n \nSOFEL's Gokuraku Yuugi: Game Tengoku (\"Paradise Play: Game Heaven\" - no relation to Rhythm Heaven) is a mini-game collection that provides eight different types of game framed as different stations on a TV. \n \nThe games are variations on: \n \nBingo \nRoulette \nDice \nSlots \nBlackjack \nPoker \nConcentration (a.k.a. Memory or Pairs) \nSpeed (a.k.a. Spit) \n \nThe Bingo and Dice games have no scoring system in-game; rather, they are simulations of a randomization process that players can use with their own physical scoring systems at home (such as bingo cards or Yahtzee\/Dice Poker sheets).","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[72924,72876,72857,60693,72859,72850,28113,31559,72852,72851],"tags":[268435470,268435472,536871066,536871186,536871641,536871926,536872843,536874083,536875182,536875240,536877381,536880890],"category":0,"keywords":[154,274,729,1014,1931,3171,4270,4328,6469,9978],"genres":[14,16],"first_release_date":568944000000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":568944000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-12","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gbfmrdqzsgjqn62jdtej.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gbfmrdqzsgjqn62jdtej","width":564,"height":640}}
