We take all the expertise of modern gaming from around the world and let it fuse under one roof. We draw inspiration from classic arcades to modern tech, helping us create villains you love to fight, armies you want to command, and worlds you want to escape too. \n\nOur passion for all things gaming brings out the odd, quirky, and straight up bizarre in all our team, and we wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. Our expertise has seen us working with major global brands over the last decade, taking the team to new heights and achievements, but as far as we are concerned, we\u2019re just getting started.\n\nAlley Labs is an independent game production studio, and has been the driving force behind many titles including Word Genius, Tribal Rivals, Meteor Blitz, Final Fortress - Idle Survival, Pocket Cafe, Pet Hotel, Sketch It, and more. We are proud to announce the launch of our incremental clicker - Final Fortress.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9760,104961,33603,11362,36962,86605,55888,2015,76397,75813],"tags":[19,268435471,1073741828],"publishers":[10811],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[19],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":1472342400000,"status":2,"platforms":[55],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":55,"date":1472342400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-28","y":2016,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kxrtrcdvdbzyekewtzqu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kxrtrcdvdbzyekewtzqu","width":1024,"height":500},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qacdnhtft4zm8wvizoxj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qacdnhtft4zm8wvizoxj","width":1242,"height":2208},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jkmcsycdduplpbxsegju.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jkmcsycdduplpbxsegju","width":1242,"height":2208},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y4aypoye1x9v23sfrwvx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y4aypoye1x9v23sfrwvx","width":1242,"height":2208},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hvzncvb0hldnyzh1rst1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hvzncvb0hldnyzh1rst1","width":1242,"height":2208}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"0q81b5gD4s0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hwx9wk82ts77gqn1dawt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hwx9wk82ts77gqn1dawt","width":1280,"height":720},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/finalfortressalleylabs.com\/"}]}
