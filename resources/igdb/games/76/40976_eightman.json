There, Tani performs an experiment that has failed seven times; Yokoda is the latest subject to have his life force transferred into an android body. For the first time, the experiment succeeds. Yokoda is reborn as the armor-skinned android 8 Man, able to dash at impossible speeds, as well as shape-shift into other people. He shifts himself into Yokoda, this time christening himself as \"Hachiro Azuma\". He keeps this identity a secret, known only to Tani and his police boss Chief Tanaka. Even his girlfriend Sachiko and friend Ichiro do not know he is an android. As 8-Man, Hachiro fights crime (even bringing his murderers to justice). He smoked \"energy\" cigarettes, to rejuvenate his powers, that he carried in a cigarette case on his belt.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76253,55038,26820,68287,36950,71455,25300,28029,10039,76723],"tags":[1,18,268435464,268435481,536870926,536871882,536871894,536873299],"category":0,"keywords":[14,970,982,2387],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8,25],"first_release_date":664329600000,"platforms":[80,52,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":664329600000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Jan-20","y":1991,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":664329600000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Jan-20","y":1991,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":664329600000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Jan-20","y":1991,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":664329600000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Jan-20","y":1991,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":691545600000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Dec-01","y":1991,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l1yp8l20knxknkwk0y7n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l1yp8l20knxknkwk0y7n","width":600,"height":759}}
