It is the first in a series of pachinko games to feature the Pachio-kun mascot. \n \nThe first game to feature Pachio-kun, the mascot for a series of pachinko-themed games by Coconuts Japan, Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachio-kun (\"Aiming For Pachinko Pro: Pachio-kun\") is simply a virtual pachinko hall with 72 different machines on which the player may try their luck. \n \nThe game rewards attentive pachinko veterans by having several of the machines possess quirks, such as the frequency of payouts, certain pins being bent that will favor a ball's route to the bottom and the like. Pachio-kun simply has to lean in to examine the machines closer to ascertain how to make the machine pay out. The overall goal is to keep playing each machine, winning either through a determined strategy or simple perseverance, until all the machines have been emptied of their contents. Doing so will win the game.","collection":3763,"popularity":1,"games":[46663,42646,42255,42253,42235,38003,38001,37997,37996,37985],"tags":[268435470,536871641,536871710],"category":0,"keywords":[729,798],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":566784000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":566784000000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Dec-18","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":569462400000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-18","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h4z3tipbmw3qn4umdfqq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h4z3tipbmw3qn4umdfqq","width":449,"height":300}}
