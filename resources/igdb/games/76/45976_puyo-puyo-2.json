What makes this a challenging two-player contest is the fact that when you clear a chain of puyos from your grid, it drops a random piece of filler onto your opponent\u2019s grid. The more puyos you clear, the more you fill your opponent\u2019s grid, and if you can clutter up his grid enough to fill it to the top, you\u2019ve won the game. An intriguing backstory makes this an amusing experience for one or two players.","collection":3350,"popularity":2,"games":[20329,55173,56033,20342,24426,23852,60044,57372,55190,25222],"tags":[1,268435465,536870990,536873787,536875046,536875379,536875434,536875472,536876763,536879119],"category":0,"keywords":[78,2875,4134,4467,4522,4560,5851,8207],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Puyo Puyo Tsuu","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Super Puyo Puyo Tsu Remix","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Super Puyo Puyo Tsu","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Puyo Puyo Tsu","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Puyo Pop","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xns8gdrkeurmismz5cgh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xns8gdrkeurmismz5cgh","width":2000,"height":2874},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
