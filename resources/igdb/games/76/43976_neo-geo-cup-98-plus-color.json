On the field you can perform passes, shots, dribbles, slidings and charges. In the story mode you have to win as many matches as possible in a series of tournaments. Before and during matches you can change the field formations and switch players. Each won match gives you prize money, this can be used to buy items for your team. These items usually improve one stat, but decrease another.","popularity":1,"games":[10121,27081,28862,18681,19459,70861,54662,4643,65659,42349],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536870990,536875161,536875433,536875668,536876259,536876534,536877560,536880927],"publishers":[1474],"category":0,"keywords":[26,78,4249,4521,4756,5347,5622,6648,10015],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":912211200000,"platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":120,"date":915148800000,"region":2,"human":"1999-Jan-01","y":1999,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":120,"date":915148800000,"region":5,"human":"1999-Jan-01","y":1999,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":120,"date":915148800000,"region":1,"human":"1999-Jan-01","y":1999,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":120,"date":912211200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Nov-28","y":1998,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p0okhk42n2unaqw6jvnz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p0okhk42n2unaqw6jvnz","width":600,"height":594}}
