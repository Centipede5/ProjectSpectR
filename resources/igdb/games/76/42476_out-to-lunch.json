So, when the vegetables start attempting to run away from him, he has no choice but to chase after them. \n \nOut To Lunch is a platform game set across 6 countries, starting off in Switzerland and finishing in Paris. To recollect the vegetables he must first stun them, either by firing at them or jumping on them, then walk over them, in a manner similar to Fire & Ice. Unusually, the game was converted from the SNES to the Amiga, not the other way around.","popularity":1,"games":[55752,36868,6705,10039,36926,117,47823,68324,19174,12632],"tags":[1,268435464,536871208,536871672,536871971,536872961,536873024,536875073,536875396,536875666,536875672,536875690,536875740,536876658,536877048,536877305,536877738,536879110],"category":0,"keywords":[296,760,1059,2049,2112,4161,4484,4754,4760,4778,4828,5746,6136,6393,6826,8198],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":754704000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":754704000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Dec-01","y":1993,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zoftwonf6khikzbdw4xy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zoftwonf6khikzbdw4xy","width":475,"height":347}}
