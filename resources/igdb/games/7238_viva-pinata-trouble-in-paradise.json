Available exclusively on Xbox 360, Viva Pi\u00f1ata: Trouble in Paradise reinvigorates a colorful and engaging gaming experience on the Xbox 360 platform. Now with full cooperative and online gameplay modes, the Viva Pi\u00f1ata franchise opens its doors even wider with a new game that provides hours of fun for gamers of all ages, fans of the animated series and animal lovers alike. \n \nReturn to Pi\u00f1ata Island \n \nPlay is easy with the Pi\u00f1ata finder. \nView larger. \n \nTeam up for co-op play in the garden. \nView larger. \n \nPi\u00f1atas are fully customizable. \nView larger. \n \nTeach pi\u00f1atas tricks with the 'trick stick tool'. \nView larger. \nThere's New Trouble on Pi\u00f1ata Island \nUnfortunately, not all is well on the island, as Professor Pester and his gang of Ruffians have wiped out Pi\u00f1ata Central's computer records, posing a threat to parties everywhere. Rebuild the computer database and thwart Professor Pester's evil plot by sending pi\u00f1atas at full candiosity to parties all around the world. Build and maintain your pi\u00f1ata gardens using your creativity and imagination to attract, trap, protect, train, and manage more than 100 different pi\u00f1ata species. \n \nMore Ways to Play \nWhile Trouble in Paradise maintains the gameplay mechanics players of the original game will remember, it also adds a few new twists, giving players more choices on how to make their garden grow. These include: \n \nPlayer Guide System - Replacing the traditional tutorial, the optional Player Guide System directs players through a series of loose goals to help them master the fundamental aspects of the game. \n \nStandard Mode - Presenting a challenge for experienced pi\u00f1ata gardeners and dedicated gamers, the Standard gameplay mode provides a more tricky option, where players must keep a watchful eye on their garden. Sour pi\u00f1atas, feuding species, weeds, illness and limited money call for you to exercise problem solving and creativity to build and maintain an environment where pi\u00f1atas can flourish and grow. \n \nJust for Fun Mode - Designed for beginner players, kids and those just looking to explore Pi\u00f1ata Island, this mode allows players to jump into the garden and interact with the unique pi\u00f1ata world. In this mode the difficulty has been turned down and the fun has been turned up. Sour pi\u00f1atas stay away, resident pi\u00f1atas remain healthy, weeds don't plague your garden and you have an infinite chocolate coin bank account, allowing you to turn your garden into a veritable utopia of colorful creatures. \n \nImproved Co-Op Play - While the original Viva Pi\u00f1ata had a simple system where two players could mutually control the single game cursor via different controllers, Trouble in Paradise adds drop-in\/drop-out offline gameplay for two players and online co-operative gameplay for up to four players. This allows additional players to join the game at any time to assist the primary player with gardening tasks. \n \nKey Features: \n \nCustomize Your Garden and Pi\u00f1atas - Plant flowers, dig ponds, even place sand and snow in your garden to make exotic species of pi\u00f1ata feel at home. Buy objects to change the weather, or get new toys for your pi\u00f1ata. And nurture the thirty-two new species of pi\u00f1ata, including sour pi\u00f1atas that infiltrate and wreak havoc in the garden. Choose to tame the sours, or feed them candy to keep them sweet. \nPlay With a Friend - Family members and friends can now share in the joy of creating a garden by plugging in an extra controller. The second player has access to all tools, actions, activities, and can help by collecting magic. It's an entirely new way to play. \nPlay Multiple Game Modes - Use the Player Guide System to master the fundamental aspects of the game. Then, try the Standard Mode where sour pi\u00f1atas, feuding species, and limited money call for you to exercise problem solving and creativity to build and maintain your garden. Or enjoy Just for Fun Mode, which allows you to build a garden full of colorful creatures without worries. \nExperience Pi\u00f1ata Vision - Plug in an Xbox LIVE Vision camera and interact with the game through the use of printed cards featuring a unique barcode. Flash a pi\u00f1ata card up to the Vision camera, and the content will drop directly into the game. \nShow off to friends - Use the new photo mode to snap, print, and upload pictures of your unique garden or customized pi\u00f1atas to show to friends. Photograph your pi\u00f1ata and turn it into a pi\u00f1ata card, then share it with your friends so they can scan it and put it into their own garden. \nTeach Your Pi\u00f1ata Tricks - Pi\u00f1atas can perform dazzling tricks, if you teach them with the new trick stick tool. Watch as pi\u00f1atas play together, perch on each other, and interact in new ways to make them even more appealing. \nAdd Game Content with Pi\u00f1ata Vision \nTrouble in Paradise also utilizes the optional Xbox LIVE Vision camera accessory through a feature entitled Pi\u00f1ata Vision. With this players can import, activate, create and share game content via optical card scanning technology. These cards do not necessarily have to be purchased, and instead are primarily downloaded from the game's website. Game developer, Rare, and Microsoft Game Studios are also considering making certain special cards available as part of promotions with magazines or gaming websites, ensuring that fans of the Viva Pi\u00f1ata franchise can expect fresh, exciting for years to come. \nProduct Description \nReturn to magical Pi\u00f1ata Island.
