Players need to feed these critters to each other so that they'll burst and drop tasty jewels for points. Some critters emit a green fluid that sticks to the screen after they burst. When the central character pops enough critters in a chain, it will regurgitate (i.e., vomit) a rainbow-colored flow of liquefied jewels into its offspring's mouth. This stylized depiction is not accompanied by visuals or sound effects that would be considered gross or off-putting. In one cutscene illustration, a creature is shown smoking a pipe while wearing a smoking jacket and playing chess.
