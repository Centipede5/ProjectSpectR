It is the third game in the series not to be developed by Gas Powered Games, (after Dungeon Siege: Legends of Aranna by Mad Doc Software and Dungeon Siege: Throne of Agony by SuperVillain Studios) and the first to be published by Square Enix after it acquired the complete ownership of the Dungeon Siege franchise. It was released on June 17, 2011. (wiki, 2014)","storyline":"The game returns to the Kingdom of Ehb, which already featured as the setting of the first (but not second) game. Roughly 150 years after the events of Dungeon Siege, the 10th Legion, who provided stability and protection for the kingdom for 400 years, has almost completely been wiped out. 30 years before the game's setting, Jeyne Kassynder rallied the people of eastern Ehb and the Azunite Church against the Legion who she blamed for the death of the king (her father). Following a long and brutal campaign, she managed to kill the entire remnant of the Legion in a battle in the Rukkenvahl Forest and the royalist army of young Queen Roslyn has been driven deep into the mines of Glitterdelve, losing almost all of their power.

Players complete quests and use swords, ranged weapons, and magic spells to kill both human and supernatural enemies (e.g., skeletons, goblins, demons, giant wolves). Battles include hack-and-slash combat, highlighted by cries of pain and brief puffs of blood. During the course of the game, players can elect to spare or kill certain boss characters; if players choose the latter, the boss is depicted in a small pool of blood. Some female characters are depicted in the game wearing low-cut outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage; the dialogue also contains some suggestive references (e.g., 'Your mother seduced Montbarron?' and 'We will seduce a foreign man, but only if he is strong . . . clever . . . handsome.'). The words 'whore,' 'damn,' and 'bastard' can be heard in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/39160"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.dungeonsiege.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"39160"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
