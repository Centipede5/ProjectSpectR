The game has 4 modes of play: the championship season mode, the exhibition race, time trials, and the challenge mode. R and Z are used to shift gears, the analog stick is used to steer the car, A is the accelerator and B is the brake. The C-buttons allow for camera changes and backmirror views. It's pretty much the same setup and how these work are pretty much unchanged from the first game to the second.","collection":4264,"rating":70.1454278168153,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":70.1454278168153,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":3,"games":[40470,44242,54789,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,26709,55590],"tags":[268435466,268435469,536871532,536872060,536874337,536875069,536875117,536876779],"developers":[1278,1489],"publishers":[1489],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[620,1148,3425,4157,4205,5867],"genres":[10,13],"first_release_date":938649600000,"platforms":[4,22,23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":938649600000,"human":"1999-Sep-30","y":1999,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":938649600000,"human":"1999-Sep-30","y":1999,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":938649600000,"human":"1999-Sep-30","y":1999,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xlno2hzh1brwp0qgf2kn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xlno2hzh1brwp0qgf2kn","width":250,"height":176},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3}}
