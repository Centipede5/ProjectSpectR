You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself. \n \nPortals riddle the planar metropolis of Sigil, providing access to anywhere in existence, but only if you have the proper key. Known as the \"City of Doors,\" Sigil is a neutral ground where demons, devas, and races from across the multiverse gather under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the city's enigmatic ruler. This is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines reality, and belief has the power to reshape worlds. \n \nIn your search for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes: a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube, a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these companions and others at The Nameless One\u2019s side, you will explore worlds in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped and some memories cost more than an even an immortal can bear.","franchise":43,"franchises":[43],"hypes":1,"rating":66.7777895904826,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":82.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":74.55556146190796,"total_rating_count":13,"rating_count":8,"version_parent":832,"version_title":"Enhanced Edition","games":[76397,81249,102873,26765,26163,25877,36044,25311,18398,26145],"tags":[17,31,268435467,268435468,268435471,268435487,536871449,536872609,536872665,536873289,536873338,1073741827],"developers":[5071],"publishers":[5071],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[537,1697,1753,2377,2426],"themes":[17,31],"genres":[11,12,15,31],"first_release_date":1491868800000,"pulse_count":7,"platforms":[34,6,39,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":34,"date":1514678400000,"region":8,"human":"2017","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":39,"date":1514678400000,"region":8,"human":"2017","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1491868800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Apr-11","y":2017,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1491868800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Apr-11","y":2017,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1491868800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Apr-11","y":2017,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bwcszskq7w1szha6ufw6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bwcszskq7w1szha6ufw6","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tijijcg9skazhm7fxs5l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tijijcg9skazhm7fxs5l","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/poxrp29i4hab26sul1gq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"poxrp29i4hab26sul1gq","width":2560,"height":1600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ipmatz9ypkpklldwf5di.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ipmatz9ypkpklldwf5di","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fffcpkandnby97tfgghf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fffcpkandnby97tfgghf","width":2560,"height":1600}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"G2wXLCIpFRg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ycdzscl5g1duafbssuwo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ycdzscl5g1duafbssuwo","width":300,"height":400},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/536210"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/studiodisrupt.tv\/"},{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.beamdog.pstee"},{"category":11,"url":"http:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/466300\/"}],"external":{"steam":"466300"}}
