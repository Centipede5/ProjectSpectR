It was developed in Windows 98 with the verge2 engine. Rather than mimic the usual stock of storylines, Diver Down attempts to break new ground with a non-cliche plot that could support a movie. There are the expected common activities of rpgs in this fashion but care was taken to create a believable world with politics and detail.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[15873],"publishers":[15873],"game_engines":[585],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[117,521],"themes":[17,18],"genres":[12,32],"first_release_date":1070668800000,"platforms":[6,13],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1070668800000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Dec-06","y":2003,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":1070668800000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Dec-06","y":2003,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i66mlu9vnr4uejjuv9o2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i66mlu9vnr4uejjuv9o2","width":174,"height":72},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/diverdown.grenideer.com\/index.htm"}]}
