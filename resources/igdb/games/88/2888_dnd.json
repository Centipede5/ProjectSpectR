The name of the game clearly comes from the Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) pen and paper role playing systems, and it uses D&D rules. Further inspired by Pedit5, the game itself is a classic dungeon crawl. It could be counted as a \"rogue-like\" but doesn't have random dungeons.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[103303,99118,54775,103282,111651,36929,106987,81249,25877,19698],"tags":[17,268435468,536871237,536873308,536875172,1073741829],"developers":[1355],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[325,2396,4260],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":473299200000,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jgf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jgf","width":640,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jge.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jge","width":640,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jgd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jgd","width":640,"height":400}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"F2CL3s20f7Q"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hc2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hc2","width":640,"height":400}}
