Players assume the role of Captain Kirk or Mr. Spock as they battle an invading alien species. As players explore space stations and planets, they use phasers, pulse rifles, and other futuristic weapons to defeat alien creatures and human enemies in frenetic combat. Players can also employ stealth takedowns (e.g., stunning characters, using a Vulcan neck pinch) to incapacitate enemies from behind. In one combat sequence (viewed from a first-person perspective), players fire torpedoes and phasers at enemy vessels. Realistic explosions and cries of pain can be heard throughout the game. Orange\/green blood-like splatter effects occur when enemies are shot; a few environments depict alien creatures lying in pools of orange\/green liquid. The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.startrekgame.com"}]}
