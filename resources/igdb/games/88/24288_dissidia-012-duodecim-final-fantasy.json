Players engage in hand-to-hand combat in 3D arenas and use axes, swords, boomerangs, and magic spells (e.g., energy balls, summoned creatures) to drain opponents' life meters. Battles are highlighted by cries of pain, colorful explosions, and slow-motion sequences that zoom in on defeated characters. A handful of female characters wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; some of these characters' breasts also jiggle during combat. Some in-game text in also contains suggestive material (e.g., \"Here's a better idea: 'Zoom camera into Tifa's cleavage!'\"). Various portrait galleries depict partially nude female characters; the general shapes of their bodies are displayed instead of actual detail (i.e., no nipples or genitalia). The words \"a*s,\" \"damn,\" and \"hell\" appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.square-enix.co.jp\/dissidia_012\/"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/finalfantasy.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dissidia_012_Final_Fantasy"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dissidia_012_Final_Fantasy"}]}
