It is the first in the Cotton series of videogames. It was ported to both the Sharp X68000 and the NEC TurboGrafx-CD in 1993. The TurboGrafx-CD version was released on Super CD-ROM and features an enhanced redbook audio soundtrack and voice acting on the Japanese release. The game was later ported to Sony PlayStation under the title Cotton Original in 1999. The PlayStation release combines the enhanced digital CD-ROM soundtrack of TurboGrafx-CD release and the gameplay\/graphics of the original Arcade version. A version was ported to the Neo Geo Pocket Color in 2000. Due to hardware limitations the Neo Geo Pocket Color features less detailed graphics and sound compared to previous versions, however it is still a faithful version of the original in terms of gameplay.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103298,103281,91793,95340,49383,43951,41595,103301,47626,28029],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":602294400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":602294400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Feb-01","y":1989,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jhehqvnwaogpnim37big.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jhehqvnwaogpnim37big","width":797,"height":930}}
