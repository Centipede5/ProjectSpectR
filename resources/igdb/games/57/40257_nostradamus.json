In the game's story, this prediction comes true in the form of an alien invasion. Originating from Saturn, the alien invasion force quickly attacks many locations on Earth in preparation for an even bigger assault and possible complete global domination. Efforts are put into the design of advanced space fighters and mecha along with the best fighter pilots - in this case, pilots Dalas and Joanna - to combat the Saturnites and dispel any further doom prophecies from materializing on Earth.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10209,10213,10210,10212,28029,87818,46356,41633,40986,40186],"tags":[268435461,536871078],"category":0,"keywords":[166],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i0yyg4qyhd12um1nentr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i0yyg4qyhd12um1nentr","width":224,"height":320}}
