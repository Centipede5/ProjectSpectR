Kid must rescue the woman he loves by crossing 6 worlds, each split into 4 levels. There are a range of baddies to beat, following pre-set attack patterns or just staying on the spot, to be killed using your sword. \n \nOnce killed most release things like tokens, keys (sometimes required to open end-of-level doors), apples (for extra energy) and occasionally poison. There are lots of semi-hidden sections and bonus areas to find and explore, including bonus arcade games and fruit machines. Every world ends with a boss.","collection":1671,"popularity":1,"games":[55752,10039,1070,19174,51485,26848,1073,36868,37094,76229],"tags":[1,268435464,536872961,536874398,536875096,536875300,536875639,536875903,536876337,536876353,1073741828],"publishers":[1084],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2049,3486,4184,4388,4727,4991,5425,5441],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mv0uxpowty4uee1ngxaj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mv0uxpowty4uee1ngxaj","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fvpknt6aopp3frcac9pu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fvpknt6aopp3frcac9pu","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/srq53wdu8f1rve0yahgu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"srq53wdu8f1rve0yahgu","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nfqsbqyb01lonrly4wda.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nfqsbqyb01lonrly4wda","width":640,"height":832}}
