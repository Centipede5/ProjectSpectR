It plays somewhat like pinball, where the player must hit the ball in one of the scoring slots, or if he fails to make it in any slot, he gets a strike. The goal is to get as many runs as possible, and just aim for a high score. The game technically plays forever or until the player gets 3 outs, but since there is a limited period for broadcasting the Baseball game, it only lasts as long. There is a 2-player mode available.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":819244800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":819244800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Dec-18","y":1995,"m":12}]}
