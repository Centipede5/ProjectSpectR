You and your crew will need to charge the fort and eliminate the gang with all firepower necessary - then fend off enemy reinforcements as you transport the girl by stagecoach safely to her home at Ridgewood Farm. \n \nThe River \nRide a raft down river, taking out rebel encampments along the way until you reach the rebel stronghold of Nosalida and a final epic battle for the town's massive weapons caches.
