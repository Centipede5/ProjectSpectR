The original Repton game was released in the summer of 1985 and has 12 levels, with passwords making it possible to jump directly to later levels. If passwords were used though, on completion of the final level, the displayed message challenged the player to complete the game without using them.","collection":2383,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[47823,117,36926,7329,26766,25300,11567,2909,12632,55752],"tags":[1,33,268435464,268435465,268435468,268435489,536871033,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871301,536871389,536871599,536871938,536871945,536871971,536872010,536872371,536872425,536872673,536875057,536875073,536875196,536875214,536875313,536875330,536875455,536875699,536875778,536875803,536875830,536875870,536876220,536876232,536876273,536876540,536877162,536878317,536879691,1073741827],"publishers":[1120],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[121,226,227,296,301,332,389,477,687,1026,1033,1059,1098,1459,1513,1761,4145,4161,4284,4302,4401,4418,4543,4787,4866,4891,4918,4958,5308,5320,5361,5628,6250,7405,8779],"themes":[1,33],"genres":[8,9,12,33],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[134,69],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":134,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":69,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/li1g9uxsfd1j3bho2hhk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"li1g9uxsfd1j3bho2hhk","width":325,"height":515}}
