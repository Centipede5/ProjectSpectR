{"id":28757,"name":"Yo Frankie!","slug":"yo-frankie","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/yo-frankie","created_at":1494763388867,"updated_at":1515731769173,"summary":"Yo Frankie! is an open source video game made by the Blender Institute, part of the Blender Foundation, originally scheduled for release in August 2008.[2] It is based on the universe and characters of the free film produced earlier in 2008 by the Blender Institute, Big Buck Bunny.[3] Like the Blender Institute's previous open film projects, the game is made using free software. Yo Frankie! runs on any platform that runs Blender and Crystal Space, including Linux, Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows. \n \nThe project started February 1, 2008, and development was completed at the end of July 2008. Due to technical delays, the actual DVD release date was postponed to November 14.[4][5] Since December 9, the game is available to download.[6] \n \nThe name Yo Frankie! refers to the game's antagonist, Frank. It was suggested by Ton Roosendaal, and selected by a community vote.[7] \n \nThe game is licensed under either the GNU GPL or LGPL, with all content being licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0.[","franchise":1011,"franchises":[1011],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[63138,74349,55752,1070,28154,61625,1073,10039,82889,81176],"tags":[268435464,536871516,536872961,1073741826],"developers":[12329],"publishers":[12329],"game_engines":[297,468],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[604,2049],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1225497600000,"platforms":[14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1225497600000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Nov-01","y":2008,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1225497600000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Nov-01","y":2008,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ogavunhgeqypvyovgpjq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ogavunhgeqypvyovgpjq","width":1350,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eg5n0wjafdl6kstswjgo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eg5n0wjafdl6kstswjgo","width":1350,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j48aq1xeimaxref0734p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j48aq1xeimaxref0734p","width":1350,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kons35jeu254w7slbvx9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kons35jeu254w7slbvx9","width":1350,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ypurvrmcd9bkzrmovw6i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ypurvrmcd9bkzrmovw6i","width":1350,"height":780}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/erkxa4ms5kelfaszvokd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"erkxa4ms5kelfaszvokd","width":1280,"height":800},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yo_Frankie!"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/apricot.blender.org\/"}]}
