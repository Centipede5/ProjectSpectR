As players traverse through mountainous open-world environments, they complete missions and quests that impact the eventual fate of their character. Players use swords, bows and arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., fireballs, ice shards) to kill various enemies (e.g., wolves, dragons, human bandits and soldiers). As players engage in melee-style combat, some sequences are highlighted by slow-motion effects, particularly for decapitations. Large blood-splatter effects also occur during combat, and some environments are stained with blood or body parts (e.g., heads impaled on spikes). Some sequences allow players to injure\/kill nonadversary characters, including prisoners chained to a wall; they scream in pain amid splashes of blood or fire. As the game progresses, the dialogue and on-screen text contains references to sexual material (e.g., \u201c. . . all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires,\u201d \u201cShe . . . raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her,\u201d and \u201cRemember when you thought [he] was . . . intent on making you . . . into his personal sex slave?\u201d). Alcohol such as wine, mead, and ale can be purchased and consumed by players' character throughout the game; in one sequence, players can engage in a drinking contest with another character, which eventually results in slurred speech (e.g., \u201cOne more. No problemsh . . . Thash grape!\u201d).","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/elderscrolls.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim_Special_Edition"},{"category":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/skyrim"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/elderscrolls.bethesda.net\/en\/skyrim"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/489830"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim"}],"external":{"steam":"489830"}}
