Bill is a 1984 game released by Imagine Software for several computer systems of the time. \n \nThe game features its hero, caveman B.C. Bill, setting out to build a family. He is armed with a club, with which he can hit and either stun or kill a variety of roaming creatures. These creatures include: cavewomen, who can be dragged back to the cave as \"wives\"; food with legs, which can be roasted on the fire and dragged back to the cave to feed the growing family; and dinosaurs, predators who will eat potential wives and food, and kill Bill on contact. Bill can also die from burning on the fire if he has no food, a broken heart if too many wives leave the cave, and starving to death if he is unable to feed his family.","popularity":1,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[8]}
