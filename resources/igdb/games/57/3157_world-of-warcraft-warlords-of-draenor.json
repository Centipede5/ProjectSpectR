World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, the fifth expansion to Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game, sends players to the world of Draenor at a pivotal moment in history to fight against and alongside legends from Warcraft\u2019s brutal past.\n\n-Level cap raised to 100\n-Boost to level 90\n-Updated player character models and improved models in general\n-Build and upgrade your own Garrison\n-Account-wide heirlooms\n-Class-specific perks","storyline":"The expansion is set after the events of World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria and takes place on the world of Draenor, the original homeworld of the orcs, prior to its destruction and the creation of Outland as featured in Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, and World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. Legendary characters of Warcraft's past, such as Grom Hellscream, Ner'zhul and Blackhand, will appear. \n\nAt the end of Mists of Pandaria, Garrosh Hellscream is overthrown as Warchief of the Horde by a combined Alliance-Horde force and taken into custody by the Pandaren so that he can stand trial for the atrocities he committed in Pandaria. However, before he can be judged, Garrosh escapes captivity and, with the aid of a mysterious ally, travels back in time to the orcish homeworld of Draenor prior to the rise of the Horde. He creates an alternate timeline by preventing the orcish clans from drinking the blood of the demon lord Mannoroth, which led to their corruption by the Burning Legion and played a major role in the events of the first three games. The clans unite into an \"Iron Horde\", using technology Garrosh brought from his time, and begin a war of conquest on Draenor, building a Dark Portal that would allow them to travel through time and lay siege to Azeroth of the present era.","collection":27,"hypes":3,"rating":71.9946638574528,"popularity":4.666666666666666,"aggregated_rating":88.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":80.16399859539305,"total_rating_count":65,"rating_count":59,"game":123,"games":[1593,2933,2004,47823,9179,28168,4756,81249,132,27092],"tags":[1,17,38,268435468,268435471,268435487,536871008,536871082,536871208,536871376,536871439,536871504,536871738,536871812,536872425,536872471,536872733,536872978,536873154,536873384,536874134,536874830,536875162,536875265,536875316,536875381,536875738,536875755,536875764,536876007,536876220,536876228,536876239,536876583,536876718,536876974,536877383,536877568,536877593,536877595,536877597,536877600,536880004,536880296,536880297,536880298,536880299,536880300,536880301,536880302,536880303,1073741827,1073741825,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[51],"publishers":[51],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[1,2,3,4],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[96,170,296,464,527,592,826,900,1513,1559,1821,2066,2242,2472,3222,3918,4250,4353,4404,4469,4826,4843,4852,5095,5308,5316,5327,5671,5806,6062,6471,6656,6681,6683,6685,6688,9092,9384,9385,9386,9387,9388,9389,9390,9391],"themes":[1,17,38],"genres":[12,15,31],"first_release_date":1415836800000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1415836800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Nov-13","y":2014,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1415836800000,"human":"2014-Nov-13","y":2014,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1415836800000,"human":"2014-Nov-13","y":2014,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"WoD","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Warlords","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vxzr5mfzx2jdes3kagcg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vxzr5mfzx2jdes3kagcg","width":2560,"height":1600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b124we2t1blof1xbb6cy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b124we2t1blof1xbb6cy","width":1840,"height":1149},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p8dvgd6dkmfqybv1ph5l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p8dvgd6dkmfqybv1ph5l","width":2560,"height":1600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kfvgsrxggjsdurx0apny.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kfvgsrxggjsdurx0apny","width":2560,"height":1600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/urxrli7jkdwy6g2vgayn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"urxrli7jkdwy6g2vgayn","width":2560,"height":1600}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/if8jrp0oyhhhomreqmmh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"if8jrp0oyhhhomreqmmh","width":1100,"height":960},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sbyuzkofaoln3agvlcx2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sbyuzkofaoln3agvlcx2","width":1100,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/weu8akydx2jhkvobkpda.jpg","cloudinary_id":"weu8akydx2jhkvobkpda","width":1260,"height":740},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jxapjoamk9ygb1iasua3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jxapjoamk9ygb1iasua3","width":1260,"height":760},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a1v0tmbxexw69dj16who.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a1v0tmbxexw69dj16who","width":1260,"height":740},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bluz6se8dkwgebavqrsv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bluz6se8dkwgebavqrsv","width":1260,"height":840}],"videos":[{"name":"Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"-eAJwvvuwEM"},{"name":"Sizzle Trailer","video_id":"qundblAU5ww"},{"name":"PreSale Trailer","video_id":"uSw_76onvwk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wtvqejdbir1t7rt6mddr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wtvqejdbir1t7rt6mddr","width":1588,"height":2248},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/eu.battle.net\/wow\/en\/warlords-of-draenor\/?autoplay=true"}]}
