When it arrives, however, it is attacked by aliens and must manoeuvre its way through the planet, avoiding or killing the aliens, gathering fuel cells to remain powered, and escaping through teleportals to move on to the next level.[1] The robot's circuitry has been damaged, however, so it cannot stop moving and has only limited braking power.[2]","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5]}
