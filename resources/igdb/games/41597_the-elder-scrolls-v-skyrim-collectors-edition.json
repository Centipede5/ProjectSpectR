The game is set two hundred years after the events of Oblivion and takes place in the fictional province of Skyrim. Over the course of the game, the player completes quests and develops the character by improving skills. Skyrim continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time, and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely.","collection":6,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":472,"version_title":"Collector's Edition","games":[81249,47823,103054,106987,101608,26163,47445,55038,103282,54775],"tags":[1,17,22,33,38,268435468,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1,17,22,33,38],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1323561600000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1323561600000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Dec-11","y":2011,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jgi4ohvuhm7ddvhuitde.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jgi4ohvuhm7ddvhuitde","width":1063,"height":1316}}
