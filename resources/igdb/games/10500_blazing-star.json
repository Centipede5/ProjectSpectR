{"id":10500,"name":"Blazing Star","slug":"blazing-star","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/blazing-star","created_at":1432080412557,"updated_at":1542316374819,"summary":"Blazing Star is a scrolling shooter video game for the Neo Geo home game system. It is the sequel to the acclaimed Neo Geo shooter Pulstar, which was itself a close cousin to the R-Type franchise. A typically hefty Neo Geo ROM at 346 Mb, the game makes extensive use of pseudo-3D prerendered sprites, brief anime and CGI cutscenes (mostly during the intro sequence), and frequent Engrish voice samples and captions. While Blazing Star was superior in many respects to previous shooter games, some fans compare it unfavorably with Pulstar on the basis that Blazing Star was overly easy and there are those that prefer the simpler 2D sprite look over the prerendered sprites that came to dominate many of the more recent shoot-em-ups.","storyline":"Sometime in their past, the planets Remuria and Mutras started an interplanetary war that showed no sign of ending. The endless fight between the human-like inhabitants of the two planets had gone so long that weapon development moved into dangerous territory: Organic Weapon Production combined with alien technology. Soon, a sentient weapon - Brawshella - was born. Brawshella gathered all animal life on both planets and forced them to do its bidding and attack the humans. In a week, the humans were assimilated by Brawshella. \n \nYet, once they were assimilated, they found no other purpose in life but to continue fighting each other. After a while, six of the assimilated fighter pilots regained their consciousness and remembered their pasts. Upon discovering their humanity, the pilots were conflicted with following Brawshella's orders or fighting it to fully regain their independence. The pilots finally turn against the machine in a battle to rediscover themselves and reclaim their planets.","rating":86,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"total_rating":86,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":3,"games":[28029,306,103298,90099,105269,68287,55038,109595,103281,103020],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,1073741828],"developers":[5675],"publishers":[5346,1474],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":885168000000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[80,52,79,48,49,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1493683200000,"region":5,"human":"2017-May-02","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1518048000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Feb-08","y":2018,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1518048000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Feb-08","y":2018,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1493683200000,"region":1,"human":"2017-May-02","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1493683200000,"region":2,"human":"2017-May-02","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":885168000000,"region":2,"human":"1998-Jan-19","y":1998,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":885168000000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Jan-19","y":1998,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":885772800000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Jan-26","y":1998,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":888278400000,"human":"1998-Feb-24","y":1998,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"ACA NEOGEO BLAZING STAR"},{"name":"\u30d6\u30ec\u30a4\u30b8\u30f3\u30b0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rvlsw7rbxbvtj6fzpeak.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rvlsw7rbxbvtj6fzpeak","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kkiudelpfelatl5eut4p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kkiudelpfelatl5eut4p","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ared3we2g0cj142c55lh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ared3we2g0cj142c55lh","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r62pbynidmuwjmvxwnwg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r62pbynidmuwjmvxwnwg","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ywxswfvzzmeqg48yotjj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ywxswfvzzmeqg48yotjj","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qqz8jwopc66oj5phffwz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qqz8jwopc66oj5phffwz","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qwi7ufwfypkigfuuhvp1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qwi7ufwfypkigfuuhvp1","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tc0ozwjvvshc9vdyxtzw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tc0ozwjvvshc9vdyxtzw","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sitj2bjwanr6uxzxwrpw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sitj2bjwanr6uxzxwrpw","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jw6pkn2rvex8ihye83wc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jw6pkn2rvex8ihye83wc","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cbjeop5urvhqpxjzqqqc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cbjeop5urvhqpxjzqqqc","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n9v6ho5xswayxhygsu4u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n9v6ho5xswayxhygsu4u","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"AicqdWPSjKg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kd2jh6uibam10mbqdqbg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kd2jh6uibam10mbqdqbg","width":600,"height":770},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards fantasy characters - Violence that is not shown but is implied","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blazing_Star"}]}
