As players explore various districts and follow the storyline, they engage in missions that often involve fistfights with thugs or rival gang members; characters can also use weapons such as bats during frenetic combat sequences. Players can perform scripted moves after building enough meter; these Heat Actions depict characters breaking necks, slamming heads into walls, and shoving bats inside enemies' mouths. Violence is often accompanied by gunfire, impact sounds, screams of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Cutscenes depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a bound man tortured with a sledgehammer; a character impaled by spikes. The game contains some sexual content: men groping women's breasts in a night club; a man guiding a woman's hand over his crotch. Players can also opt to visit parlors where they can flirt with women over the phone: close-up images of a bikini-clad woman are shown in the background. During the course of the game, players can order and drink whiskey at a bar\u2014a status icon indicates drunkenness. Another sequence allows players' character to engage in a game of darts after consuming alcohol, as the screen blurs and shakes during play. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Violence towards defenceless people - Sexual violence - Strong language - Content that teaches or encourages gambling","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/638970\/Yakuza_0"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/ryu-ga-gotoku.com\/zero\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yakuza_0"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/yakuza.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yakuza_0"}],"external":{"steam":"638970"}}
