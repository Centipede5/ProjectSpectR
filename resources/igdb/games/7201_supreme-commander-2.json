From an overhead perspective, players control an armored command unit on a vast battlefield. This main base is essentially a giant piloted robot, and it is the hub from which players use their resource management skills and strategic planning to survive the futuristic battles. Players can launch missiles, dispatch soldiers, position robots and tanks, and release laser fire to defeat enemy units. In some sequences, robots and structures explode in a flurry of small laser blasts. Occasionally, soldiers within the robotic armor can be seen reacting with pain when attacked. Branching storylines depict dramatic scenes: space battles in which ships and stations explode, buildings laid in waste, factories set ablaze, soldiers mourning comrades at lonely tombstones. Though laser fire gets frenetic, and the themes are sometimes heavy, players are essentially building, salvaging, guarding, and dispatching\u2014actions dictated by commands, a viewpoint that is somewhat detached (bird's-eye view of the grid-like landscape).","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\nIt contains: Violence that is not shown but is implied\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.supremecommander.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/40100"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Supreme_Commander_2"}],"external":{"steam":"40100"}}
