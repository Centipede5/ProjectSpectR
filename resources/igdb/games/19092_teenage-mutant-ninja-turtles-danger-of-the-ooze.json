From a side-scrolling perspective, players explore sewers and urban environments while battling ninjas and other fantastical enemies (e.g., robots, mutants, alien creatures). Players punch, kick, and use various weapons and tools (e.g., swords, staffs, smoke bombs) to defeat enemies in melee-style combat. Enemies disappear amid puffs of smoke and\/or sparks when defeated. In one sequence, a character shoots lasers from its posterior, an action accompanied by flatulence sound effects.","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":3}}
