To do this you must find body parts for your monster. To get these you can dig up graves or stealthily attack lone walkers late at night and beat the stuffing out of them. Then you take them back to your castle and either finish them off or lock them in your little dungeon until you're ready to 'request' their assistance in your endeavor. \n \nFinally, when you've found choice parts for your monster, you must take him to stonehenge (clich\u00e9 alert) and have him struck by lightning to come to life. The residents of the village are not especially impressed by your idea and will attempt to stop you. \n \nUnlock the dark side of your psyche, turn the lights down low, put on a maniac-type laugh and go build yourself a monster.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,25222,25646,27266,18011,11296,54678,26914,18167,28289],"tags":[19,268435465,268435487,536871939,536872032,536873787,536875549],"category":0,"keywords":[1027,1120,2875,4637],"themes":[19],"genres":[9,31],"first_release_date":476064000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":476064000000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Feb-01","y":1985,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/amfsab6l0srv1gzbus3k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"amfsab6l0srv1gzbus3k","width":640,"height":929}}
