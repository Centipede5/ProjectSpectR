Presented in a trivia gameshow style supporting up to four players, it consists of about 1,000 questions spread out over 20 episodes. Much of the game involves watching live-action video footage of young women in bikinis, and as the player succeeds in the game the women eventually expose their breasts. The game garnered much controversy and was the subject of a lawsuit.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19785,19083,22486,19808,19082,22422,76397,22423,67166,22469],"tags":[27,34,42,268435465,268435471,268435482,536871255,536871262,536871446,536871684,536872626,536872873,536873513,536873787,536874498,536874694,536875051,536875265,536875281,536875338,536875426,536875556,536875632,536875751,536875895,536876380,536876642,536876663,536878324,536879715,536879750],"developers":[2567],"publishers":[204],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[343,350,534,772,1714,1961,2601,2875,3586,3782,4139,4353,4369,4426,4514,4644,4720,4839,4983,5468,5730,5751,7412,8803,8838],"themes":[27,34,42],"genres":[9,15,26],"first_release_date":1093824000000,"platforms":[6,11,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1093824000000,"human":"2004-Aug-30","y":2004,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1093824000000,"human":"2004-Aug-30","y":2004,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1093824000000,"human":"2004-Aug-30","y":2004,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nd2dijpb6ygfyuokua7q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nd2dijpb6ygfyuokua7q","width":256,"height":361},"esrb":{"rating":6}}
