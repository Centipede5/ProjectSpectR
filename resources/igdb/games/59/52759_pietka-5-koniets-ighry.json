This time, the two unlikely heroes are being used as pawns in a grand scheme by a mysterious mastermind named Kotovsky and his even more mysterious \"behind-the-scenes\" boss, who want to change the political face of Russia forever. Will Petka and his mentor be able to thwart the danger and save their homeland once again?.. \n \nNot much has changed in this installment; as all the previous games in the series, Konec Igry (\"End of the Game\") is a traditional point-and-click adventure game, with 2D cartoon-like character graphics and backgrounds. The gameplay mostly revolves around talking to characters, gathering information, and solving puzzles mostly through manipulation of inventory items.","collection":2841,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[26298,2274,28277,102321,61548,25877,37419,15911,78632,32597],"tags":[27,268435487,1073741828],"developers":[12291],"publishers":[2992],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[27],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1097107200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1097107200000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Oct-07","y":2004,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Petka 5: Konec Igry"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nk8lfofbfq0wq752tvdj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nk8lfofbfq0wq752tvdj","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zcoz6ievbdzxtqjlpj8k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zcoz6ievbdzxtqjlpj8k","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m3s5idtfdlkkbdam1wmp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m3s5idtfdlkkbdam1wmp","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r0gozrxyo4dxhvyideln.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r0gozrxyo4dxhvyideln","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dggy2cx2bdbhqijfhbs7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dggy2cx2bdbhqijfhbs7","width":800,"height":600}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uai1xopuqamepsuuabkl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uai1xopuqamepsuuabkl","width":800,"height":803},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/ru.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B0_5:_%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86_%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D1%8B"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.petka-vich.ru\/"}]}
