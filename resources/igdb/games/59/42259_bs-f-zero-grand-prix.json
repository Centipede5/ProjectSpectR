It was released in four parts from late-1996 to early-1997, and was a SoundLink title where an announcer provided commentary during gameplay. As the original game was only three cups, a fourth cup called Ace League was added. Each cup had the courses in a slightly different order, and a new course not found in the original game served as the fifth track (with Mute City I being reused once at the beginning of the final week).","collection":605,"popularity":1,"games":[68287,71455,26766,40470,36950,67067,67056,63231,63192,60342],"tags":[18,268435466,536871882,536875069],"category":0,"keywords":[970,4157],"themes":[18],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":854755200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":854755200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Feb-01","y":1997,"m":2}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"qFA__wbK0po"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xi8p4jnl694yserfb4s2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xi8p4jnl694yserfb4s2","width":250,"height":212}}
