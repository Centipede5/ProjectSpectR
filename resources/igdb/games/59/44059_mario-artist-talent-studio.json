The process is similar to Nintendo's later Miis, but much more detailed. The characters can then be inserted into movies and animations. Events during these movies can be controlled by pressing the Z-trigger. Images from external video can be imported using the Capture Cartridge.","collection":4603,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[73027,60044,73026,65832,80590,78226,76903,66730,65496,23674],"tags":[536872407,536876083,536877102,536882221],"category":0,"keywords":[1495,5171,6190,11309],"first_release_date":953769600000,"platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":953769600000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Mar-23","y":2000,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yt3fmxftrkck1bdfduq7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yt3fmxftrkck1bdfduq7","width":250,"height":216}}
