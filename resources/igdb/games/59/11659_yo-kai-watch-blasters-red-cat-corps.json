From a 3\/4-overhead perspective, players explore the town, complete objectives, recruit\/rescue friendly Yo-kai, and battle enemies in melee-style combat. Players use a variety of attacks (e.g., paw strikes, magic attacks, weapon blasts) to drain enemies' life meters, causing them to disappear amid puffs of smoke. One boss encounter shows a creature pummeling smaller characters with a giant mace. The game includes some depictions and references to bodily functions: a Yo-Kai (Snotsolong) with mucous dripping from its nose; Yo-Kai (Cuttincheez and Cheeksqueek) with buttocks for heads, using flatulence-like attacks.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game was rated PEGI 7 for non-realistic violence in a child-friendly setting or context.
