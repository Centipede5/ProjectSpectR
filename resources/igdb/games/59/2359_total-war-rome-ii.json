Players can manage their faction's economic and political infrastructure and expand territories through military conquests. From distant or zoomed-in views, players arrange military units (e.g., infantry, cavalry) and naval fleets around battlefields; conflicts are highlighted by battle cries, sword-clanging sounds, and explosions. Cutscenes depict more intense instances of violence: characters impaled by swords\/spears; a prisoner executed from a distant perspective. The dialogue sometimes contains references to suggestive material (e.g., \u201cThey\u2026fornicate with sheep when they get the chance,\u201d \u201cNice dress. It'll look better on my bedroom floor,\u201d and \u201cIs that a bread roll in your toga or are you just pleased to see me?\u201d). Alcohol is also referenced in the text\/dialogue (e.g., \u201cI wish I had some wine with us\u201d and \u201cOver there are Gauls, mead-drunk, blood-drunk\u201d). The word \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4}}
