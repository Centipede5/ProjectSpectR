If three ghosts are caught within a time-limit, the skull will disappear and a submarine sandwich appears. When eaten, it gives you a magic bone which when dropped in the path of the skull will momentarily freeze it in place. When Scooby is caught by the skull, the difficulty will go down. There's 10 mazes in all, but with the keyboard addon for Intellivision you can also make your own mazes.","collection":3290,"popularity":1,"games":[25222,25646,18167,60044,26223,14047,26192,26914,56292,37094],"tags":[1,23,268435465,536870928,536871599,536873787,536875088,536875291,536875485],"category":0,"keywords":[16,687,2875,4176,4379,4573],"themes":[1,23],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983-Dec-31","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tmyvofnyvqn1y7mg45v4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tmyvofnyvqn1y7mg45v4","width":273,"height":376}}
