It was based on two earlier black-and-white coin-operated arcade games produced by Atari. Combat had color graphics and numerous gameplay variations. The 27 game modes featured a variety of different combat scenarios, including tanks, biplanes, and jet fighters. The tank games had interesting options such as bouncing munitions (\"Tank-Pong\") and invisibility. The biplane and jet games also allowed for variation, such as multiple planes per player and an inventive game with a squadron of planes versus one giant bomber.","rating":68.77353972326729,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":68.77353972326729,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":7,"games":[83728,27091,8422,18088,28751,15894,14758,103020,81141,19549],"tags":[1,39,268435461,268435489,536870913,536870931,536870933,536870937,536871186,536871846,536872733,536873753,536874539,536875137,536875171,536875230,536875258,536875411,536875412,536875416,536875435,536875656,536875939,536876296,536876990,536877204,536882814,1073741827],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[1,19,21,25,274,934,1821,2841,3627,4225,4259,4318,4346,4499,4500,4504,4523,4744,5027,5384,6078,6292,11902],"themes":[1,39],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":241920000000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":283910400000,"region":1,"human":"1978","y":1978,"m":12},{"category":1,"platform":59,"date":241920000000,"region":2,"human":"1977-Sep","y":1977,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Tank Plus","comment":"Acronym"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"uk7fIrXpW8o"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"GuCXiz45i9k"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pxutukwqpci8mfusrjcx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pxutukwqpci8mfusrjcx","width":300,"height":405},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Combat_(Atari_2600)"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":59,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2}]}
