Half of the stages take place within the mind of the King of All Cosmos, who gets knocked in the head and suffers from amnesia. The levels are black-and-white in appearance, and the objective is to roll up junk to bring color back to the stages. The other half of the stages take place in the present, where RoboKing, a robotic version of the King of All Cosmos created by the cousins, goes on a rampage and destroys all the stars in the sky.","collection":910,"rating":80.0299102691924,"popularity":3.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":81,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":80.51495513459619,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":4,"games":[6453,16745,24426,1905,20342,56033,20329,55173,16992,15409],"tags":[1,27,268435465,268435487,536871139,536871159,536871262,536871672,536872010,536872211,536872339,536872695,536873249,536873787,536874706,536875084,536875102,536875151,536875157,536875301,536875355,536875424,536875433,536875456,536875465,536875537,536875579,536875580,536875594,536875607,536875662,536875792,536875954,536876131,536876332,536876432,536876762,536877105,536877305,536877311,536877390,536877802,536877813,536878404,536878562,536878600,536879069,536880046,536880413,536880843,536880943,536881315,536882676,536882807,536883994,1073741826],"developers":[248],"publishers":[248],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[227,247,350,760,1098,1299,1427,1783,2337,2875,3794,4172,4190,4239,4245,4389,4443,4512,4521,4544,4553,4625,4667,4668,4682,4695,4750,4880,5042,5219,5420,5520,5850,6193,6393,6399,6478,6890,6901,7492,7650,7688,8157,9134,9501,9931,10031,10403,11764,11895,13082],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[9,31],"first_release_date":1248307200000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1248307200000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Jul-23","y":2009,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1253232000000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Sep-18","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1253577600000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Sep-22","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1248307200000,"human":"2009-Jul-23","y":2009,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u584a\u9b42TRIBUTE"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eb1arbtmueyj0amn1fzc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eb1arbtmueyj0amn1fzc","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ehc9wc3kcdhmihto5kwa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ehc9wc3kcdhmihto5kwa","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/at9hnxqug6arlnh6x3vd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"at9hnxqug6arlnh6x3vd","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bkiqquzygdo82no18yf9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bkiqquzygdo82no18yf9","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xl1nt5jsqlmhmtbvaung.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xl1nt5jsqlmhmtbvaung","width":1920,"height":1080}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wtiyxlpnsgiv7k6qp6jo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wtiyxlpnsgiv7k6qp6jo","width":4677,"height":2813},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b2uz7z1mvg2nlagbmexn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b2uz7z1mvg2nlagbmexn","width":5000,"height":6000}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"7qC8ZsfcRt4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gwt3bqyea1ck6suexc72.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gwt3bqyea1ck6suexc72","width":435,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a puzzle\/adventure game in which players roll a small ball around cities, collect random items (e.g., dice, beer signs, candy, smoking pipes, buckets, etc.) that stick to the ball, and make the ball grow in size.

Sumo wrestlers, children, animals, and police officers can join the ride, though they sometimes cry out and wriggle around as they get stuck to the giant ball.
