When atmospheric pollution nearly annihilates life on Earth, the remnants of humanity construct a purification system called Basel. In time, the surviving human population create a civilization around Basel's central tower, watched over by its mechanical core Zenith. Zenith ties human lives to quartz stones, making them immune to the pollution while giving them predetermined social status and lifespans. The three protagonists\u2014Zephyr, Leanne, and Vashyron\u2014form a mercenary group that take odd jobs for the populace of Basel. During their missions, they discover a plan by the city's ruling Cardinals to subvert Zenith's rule, and discover their own connections to the Cardinals' plans.","storyline":"In a distant future, the earth decayed to the point where life as we knew no longer existed. Toxins in the air poisoned the land and water, and earth's warped axis even robbed us of time. The human race, unable to adapt to the changes brought by such harsh environmental destruction, rapidly began to die out as a species.\n\nThose that survived created Basel, a gigantic structure embedded beneath the earth, designed to purify the atmosphere and normalize the environment. Little by little, life began to reassert itself as people formed civilizations around Basel, but as more and more people withdrew into this tiny world constructed by man, they came to repeat the mistakes of the past... Thus begins the story of a world nearing it's end, and the intertwining fates of those who inhabit it.","rating":69.9824300470239,"popularity":4.333333333333334,"aggregated_rating":76.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":73.3245483568453,"total_rating_count":13,"rating_count":8,"games":[36950,55038,54842,68441,90099,28168,2933,25300,24863,11156],"tags":[1,18,268435468,536870981,536871094,536871327,536871817,536871882,536871938,536872014,536872205,536872412,536873247,536873364,536873724,536875057,536875157,536875257,536875281,536875293,536875358,536875453,536875572,536875590,536875695,536875830,536875953,536876090,536876199,536876220,536876237,536876261,536876695,536877133,536877155,536877264,536877386,536877628,536877986,536878256,536883660,536883865,536883948,536884354,1073741826],"developers":[1983],"publishers":[112],"game_engines":[215],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,182,415,905,970,1026,1102,1293,1500,2335,2452,2812,4145,4245,4345,4369,4381,4446,4541,4660,4678,4783,4918,5041,5178,5287,5308,5325,5349,5783,6221,6243,6352,6474,6716,7074,7344,12748,12953,13036,13442],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1264636800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1269561600000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Mar-26","y":2010,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1268697600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Mar-16","y":2010,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1264636800000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Jan-28","y":2010,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1264636800000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Jan-28","y":2010,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1268697600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Mar-16","y":2010,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1269561600000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Mar-26","y":2010,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"End of Eternity","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9 \u30aa\u30d6 \u30a8\u30bf\u30cb\u30c6\u30a3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fy5vxwnwc0lsqrrjuoff.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fy5vxwnwc0lsqrrjuoff","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q1vhweaojoansttyxakn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q1vhweaojoansttyxakn","width":1274,"height":717},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iyzrhxdduzmlepvexawq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iyzrhxdduzmlepvexawq","width":1280,"height":720}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mn74gavu2q9tqyytbbzp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mn74gavu2q9tqyytbbzp","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qboczelg2fvzz4bxxvrn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qboczelg2fvzz4bxxvrn","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hyptvklvwljzr0rcidtb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hyptvklvwljzr0rcidtb","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tatmscw1l72aoxwqvyeh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tatmscw1l72aoxwqvyeh","width":900,"height":1260},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bdd8aihkjj9mojw7k2ji.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bdd8aihkjj9mojw7k2ji","width":900,"height":1150},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m7vpapglm6pri8pzm93c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m7vpapglm6pri8pzm93c","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/neudxp7gq2wdocs6lcok.jpg","cloudinary_id":"neudxp7gq2wdocs6lcok","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vf1nxzgagzfnh1ab0hqx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vf1nxzgagzfnh1ab0hqx","width":1000,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"zWqhRgMhoPg"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"iUQIWzHvQu8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vraabletmgau5vzjspld.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vraabletmgau5vzjspld","width":256,"height":315},"esrb":{"synopsis":"In this role-playing game, set in the post-apocalyptic future, humankind survives inside the ruins of a massive clock tower. Players are mercenaries who live within this tower (of Basel) and take on jobs, missions, and menial tasks requested from on above, from the Cardinal ruling class. Several missions involve using firearms (pistols, machine guns, etc.) and explosives to kill an assortment of humans, robots, monsters, and wild dogs\u2014usually in the service of obtaining pieces of Quartz. Combat is somewhat fantastical as players can kick grenades like a soccer ball, leap twenty feet in the air, and discharge bullets amid a cascade of lights, floating hit points, and swerving camera angles (blood is rarely depicted during battle). During the course of the game, characters sometimes drink their shots of whiskey, request their bottles of wine.\r\n\r\n[The following provides more in-depth details, relevant factors and reasons for the rating assignment]\r\n\r\nSome of the stronger depictions of violence\u2014and blood\u2014occur during cinematic cutscenes: two men walk past a reflective puddle of blood; a villain in a gun standoff shoots an unarmed adversary in the chest as a thin wisp of blood trails; a character puts a gun into an enemy's mouth and discharges two rounds\u2014the camera pans away as the shots are fired. The camera does not pan away from a woman's breasts (fully covered) that jiggle vigorously during a dinner cutscene: the sequence focuses equal attention on one man's humorous reaction to the pleasure moans, to the elaborate breast physics. Sexual Themes is one way to describe the mercenary's fever-pitch fixation on body parts that move; \"bunker busters\" is another (so named by the man).","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Resonance_of_Fate"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/resonanceoffate.wikia.com\/wiki\/Resonance_of_Fate_Wiki"}]}
