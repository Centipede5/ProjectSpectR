Set on hilly terrain, similar to artillery games likeScorched Earth, the gameplay is real time instead of turn-based. It supports two to seven players, represented by differently-colored tanks, with a range of weapons. The terrain on which this occurs, an ever-decreasing yellow landscape, is completely obliterated by the players during gameplay or otherwise gradually whittles down to a flat plain. \n \nThe original Death Tank was a bonus game in the Sega Saturn version of PowerSlave (1996). A sequel\/update, Death Tank Zwei, was hidden in the Saturn version of Duke Nukem 3D (1997).","popularity":1,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":1,"category":0,"first_release_date":1237334400000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1237334400000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Mar-18","y":2009,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zhjdyzpa3h60jenochdh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zhjdyzpa3h60jenochdh","width":480,"height":270}]}
