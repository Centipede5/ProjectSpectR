As a result, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, but remnants of the earlier version still remain in the game. For example, the final boss has a striking resemblance to the titular terminator in the film.\nJourney to Silius was originally conceived as a game based on the 1984 film The Terminator. However, Sunsoft lost the license during development and as a result the plot and graphics were altered before release.","storyline":"In the year 0373 of the new space age calendar, overpopulation of Earth has led to increased demand for emigration to space colonies.

However, the space station is obliterated in an explosion, killing the entire research team and destroying all data on board.\nIn his father's home, Jay discovers a floppy disk containing not only the complete SSS colony plans but a personal message from his father asking that he complete the projects should terrorists succeed in destroying the colony. To protect the colony plans and to avenge his father's death, Jay sets out to fight the terrorists responsible for the space colony's destruction.","collection":4129,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[36950,68287,55038,23852,90099,57187,11131,37016,19561,35994],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435464,268435487,536870979,536870981,536871487,536871572,536871882,536871937,536871939,536872587,536874398,536874947,536875075,536875358,536875483,536875523,536875572,536875670,536875707,536875904,536876028,536876237,536876348,536876378,536876634,536876685,536877309,536878004,536878192,536878483,536880253,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[67,69,575,660,970,1025,1027,1675,3486,4035,4163,4446,4571,4611,4660,4758,4795,4992,5116,5325,5436,5466,5722,5773,6397,7092,7280,7571,9341],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,8,31],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[7,18],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":18,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":7,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Raf World","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30e9\u30d5\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Rafu W\u0101rudo","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Rough World","comment":"Japanese title"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"9GG7fcVD18I"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rrtq3sa0dwtnhunosobh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rrtq3sa0dwtnhunosobh","width":252,"height":358}}
