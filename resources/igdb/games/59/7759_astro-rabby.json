The player must jump along platforms in search of a heart, which will allow the player to upgrade Rabby and proceed on to the next level. A level will loop indefinitely until the heart is found.","popularity":1,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1,1073741827],"developers":[3672],"publishers":[3671],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":655689600000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":655689600000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Oct-12","y":1990,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30a2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30e9\u30d3\u30fc","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c59sb5zvjfjsnyktyh3c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c59sb5zvjfjsnyktyh3c","width":220,"height":257}}
