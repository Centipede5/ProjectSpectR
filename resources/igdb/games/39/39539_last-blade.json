History's hidden secret is revealed. During the age known as \"Bakumatsu\", 135 years ago, chaos rules! It's all yours: A new type of weapon fighting game in which Power and Speed weapons, in addition to various Repel moves can be used to experience a new sensation in video game thrills!","storyline":"A translation of the story officially given by SNK is as follows: \n \n\"Two worlds once existed since ancient times... The world of the living, Ushyo, and the land of the dead, Tokoyo. A legendary boundary to forever separate them, The Hell's Gate, has existed since the birth of myths to keep an universal balance. There is said to be four gods that defend it: Seiryu of the East, Byakko of the West, Genbu of the North, and Suzaku of the South. They eternally perform their duty from the shadows of legend and were eventually forgotten by people as time passed. \n \nNow, it is the 'Bakumatsu'. \n \nThe Tokugawa shogunate, after 200 years of reign, began to have samurai who long dulled their battle skills during the outskirts of the Heian period. People, who have long since grown used to peace, are met with fascinating foreigners and wonder about the confines of their isolation. To add to the confusion, a sudden disturbance occurs. \n \nA natural disaster unprecedented in Japan's history began. It was rumored to be the Majin Revival, a time when gods were to walk the land once more and deliver divine punishment. In a land where no chaos was said to exist, the people could do nothing but watch and despair. \n \nHowever, it was said that there are individuals who did not. People who haven't lost their fighting spirit and stood to face the chaos. Those who wanted to find the real cause behind the disturbance and stop it. Moreover, people who were unexpectedly born at the center of chaos. Those who had the ambitions to control the threat and those who are said to be the cause of the Majin Revival. Without speculation of their cause, they are brought together by a heavy fate as their battle begins.\" \n \nThe passage to the land of the dead, Hell's Gate, which was previously guarded by Four Sacred Beasts appears to be opened. However, chaos sweeps the land once the gods are encased in human flesh, otherwise known as the Majin Revival. The story of the series continues to focus on how certain individuals choose to confront such conflict, and depicts how each of them are drawn on the same string of fate.","collection":4294,"rating":85,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":85,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":1,"games":[105056,78625,2254,103269,106859,106777,103848,99742,99740,99735],"tags":[268435460,1073741828],"developers":[1474],"publishers":[1474],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":883958400000,"platforms":[52,5,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1513209600000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Dec-14","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1513209600000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Dec-14","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1331596800000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Mar-13","y":2012,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1343865600000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Aug-02","y":2012,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1339027200000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jun-07","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":883958400000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jan-05","y":1998,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u5e55\u672b\u6d6a\u6f2b \u6708\u83ef\u306e\u5263\u58eb","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oj4arqpuvzx4fkxosbup.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oj4arqpuvzx4fkxosbup","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l0hblm6vnlkivoeab0pe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l0hblm6vnlkivoeab0pe","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jvqabgxvejihekvhdt3n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jvqabgxvejihekvhdt3n","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bns3pxfbk1olbce88bb1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bns3pxfbk1olbce88bb1","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qaxpzqirfzqkxgkfcj8o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qaxpzqirfzqkxgkfcj8o","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dounotiwe8qkquosewyj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dounotiwe8qkquosewyj","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qhny9rh1zzkncqfbv8zw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qhny9rh1zzkncqfbv8zw","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lgw3t6fj41kbbx7a6biw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lgw3t6fj41kbbx7a6biw","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rc3helgp9dzpparntwjy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rc3helgp9dzpparntwjy","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xhqrduhhndacyakp15cw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xhqrduhhndacyakp15cw","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z65spemo0qskkjm22p1u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z65spemo0qskkjm22p1u","width":559,"height":419},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nmt6imrxjpovqurgtuh6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nmt6imrxjpovqurgtuh6","width":559,"height":419}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"pYoVkj-WCrg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rzhazklf2vbh5mgk0pja.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rzhazklf2vbh5mgk0pja","width":650,"height":905},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Last_Blade"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/snk.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Last_Blade"}]}
