Players travel around the world, navigate through missions that increase characters' skill, and eliminate an assortment of enemies and terrorists. Players use shotguns, assault rifles, machine guns, grenades, and knives to kill enemies. Stealth attacks allow players to sneak up on and stab unsuspecting enemies. The most intense depictions of violence occur during interactive cutscenes where players have the option to 'spare\/wait' or 'execute\/goodbye' villains. Players can shoot surrendered enemies at close range with bullets to the stomach, kneecap, and forehead. Most injuries and deaths result in blood splatter that occasionally pools on the floor. During the course of the game, players can come across exotic dancers dressed in skimpy clothing. In one scene, the central character has (implied) sex with a female villain: The villain is shown in underwear and climbs on top of the central character and mounts him; sexual activity is never depicted as the scene fades to black. One character in the game is depicted snorting cocaine from his hand; the central character comments that the person is 'f*cking high.'","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Glamorisation of drugs - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.alphaprotocol.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/34010"}],"external":{"steam":"34019"}}
