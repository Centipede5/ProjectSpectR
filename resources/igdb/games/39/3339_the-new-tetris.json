First, in addition to clearing lines, one can also form 4x4 large squares of four pieces to form 'blocks'. When a block is created, it turns solid gold or silver, depending on the makeup of the block\u2014a block built from all the same kind of piece becomes a golden block or \"monosquare\", while any other combination becomes a silver block or \"multisquare\". Blocks can only be constructed from whole pieces: if any part of a piece has been cleared, then it cannot be used to form a block. When a line that has pieces from a block is cleared, it earns more points.","collection":516,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[8197,60044,25222,26223,51179,49875,18011,24426,80249,20342],"tags":[268435465,536871277,536872307,536872810,536873064,536873787,536874943,536875379,536876085,536876266,536876543,536876763,536881118,536884031,1073741828],"developers":[1749],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[365,1395,1898,2152,2875,4031,4467,5173,5354,5631,5851,10206,13119],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":933379200000,"platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":933379200000,"human":"1999-Jul-31","y":1999,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e20lgztxoe2hhsphwg3l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e20lgztxoe2hhsphwg3l","width":256,"height":180},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3}}
