The player (a white smiling face) travels on a field, trying to collect all dots and symbols and escaping evil Red Faces. There are also destructible (light-blue) and indestructible (dark blue) blocks on field.\n\nThere is only one playing field, but it is randomly generated: there is random block placement, in-field bonus symbols randomly restocked after each death, and, moreover, each Red Face can remove or place any symbol on board (including indestructible blocks).\n\nThere are no different levels and the game plays on the same board until the player loses all lives.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36794,36608,34919,51485,22819,40524,51683,24199,23175,16468],"tags":[1,268435489,1073741827],"publishers":[11351],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":410140800000,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h0e1o6ta4aznutx9ysjc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h0e1o6ta4aznutx9ysjc","width":640,"height":400}}
