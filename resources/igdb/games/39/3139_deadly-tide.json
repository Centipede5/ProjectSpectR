One of their ships sits at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, raising sea levels continuously for 5 years until almost 88% of the surface is submerged. In order to effectively fight the aliens, the fictional Earth Ocean Alliance develops the \"Hydras\", one-man submarine fighter craft. \n \nThe player takes on the role of the last remaining fighter pilot.
