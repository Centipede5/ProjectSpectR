We're experiencing internal turmoil and crisis. Swipe the cards left or right to comment about events that come to you from your reporters and assistants. Be careful. The words you speak have never been so important. \n \nOh! The things that happen in our country during this time of chaos. Bribes, immorality, and scandals exist as a result of the bullying that ran society into this chaos. People who are victims and worn need your help, and a government that wants to fix those things need your help too. Some people won't like your comments and decisions. Some people will try to take you down. However, the people who try to take you down because of your status will heed witness to your rise. \n \nPlease be careful, though. Think for a long time about your decision. Your comments can help you to rise up, but at the same time, they can cause you to fail. Who will your friends be? Who will your enemies be? Its hard to say... In this game, you will be exposed to threats, reactions, and bribes. You can't stop what happened so far, but you can still shape what happens next.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55036,77597,32510,17613,9472,29173,36553,55590,30457,33552],"tags":[21,268435471,536874694,536894403,1073741829],"game_engines":[509],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3782,23491],"themes":[21],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":1545696000000,"platforms":[34],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1545696000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Dec-25","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xdn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xdn","width":720,"height":1280},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xdm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xdm","width":720,"height":1280},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xdl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xdl","width":720,"height":1280},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xdk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xdk","width":720,"height":1280},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xdj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xdj","width":720,"height":1280}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"EtSzqkEfVgQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1ilp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1ilp","width":1136,"height":1136},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.FurkanAktas.EthicsJournalistsWay"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/instagram.com\/cool1adam"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cool1adam"}]}
