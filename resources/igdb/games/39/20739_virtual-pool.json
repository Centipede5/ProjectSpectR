Featuring realistic pool angles and physics, it is usable as not only a game, but as a teaching tool for novice players. Outlined further in the manual, players are able to learn and master ball throwing, spin transfers, carom shots, bank shots, and spinning English shots. \n \nPlayed from a 360-degree rotational 3D viewpoint, Virtual Pool gives players the ability to walk around the table to check out their next shot and take a closer look at ball positions. You can zoom around the table, look left or right, and even check out an overhead view from above, something unavailable in a real pool game. Once the cue ball is lined up in accordance with the wanted shot, fire away!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":882316800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":882316800000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Dec-17","y":1997,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oxfny31roz5yjlbh9m3z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oxfny31roz5yjlbh9m3z","width":1385,"height":1417}}
