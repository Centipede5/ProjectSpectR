Against the computer or a friend, you'll go head-to-head in some fast-paced puzzle games that will bow you away. The object is to fill your opponent's side of the board while keeping your own side clear of any blocks. \n \nIf you connect four quads (blocks) of the same color, you'll create a chain reaction that will really give you an advantage. If you find yourself in a pinch, utilize a bomb to temporarily clear your board. There are four gameplay modes to choose from Arcade Competition, Time Trials, Chain Reaction, and Insane and more than 20 levels to master, making TEMCO STACKERS one of the most complete action or puzzle games available.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,60044,14047,26223,27266,19222,41348,8197,25646,236],"tags":[268435465,536873787,536875093,536875284],"category":0,"keywords":[2875,4181,4372],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":875664000000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":875664000000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Oct-01","y":1997,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Dero-N Dero Dero","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qdxym1tmj31jgym9wn4m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qdxym1tmj31jgym9wn4m","width":1070,"height":1070}}
