{"id":8439,"name":"Karmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame","slug":"karmaflow-the-rock-opera-videogame","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/karmaflow-the-rock-opera-videogame","created_at":1420287808812,"updated_at":1537798425081,"summary":"Karmaflow is a unique spin on the traditional gaming experience. In Karmaflow, the game\u2019s story is presented entirely in the form of a rock opera, sung by some of the world\u2019s most talented rock voices.\n\nKarmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame is a puzzle platformer featuring music performed by various musicians. Simone Simons (Epica), Dani Filth (Cradle of Filth), Marc Hudson (Dragonforce), Tony Kakko (Sonata Artica) and Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy) all have lent their vocal talents to Karmaflow, along with the Metropole Orkest (the world\u2019s biggest \u2013 Grammy-award winning \u2013 professional pop and jazz orchestra) working on the game\u2019s score.\n\nThe aesthetic of Karmaflow is inspired by games such as the Zelda-series, Journey and the darker tone of Darksiders. The first world starts out rather dark and mysterious, while the third world has got plenty of crimson and its character design is directly influenced by the culture and legends of the Tibetan people. The sung narrative itself will have real depth and cover fascinating themes such as balance and contradictions.","storyline":"You take on the role of the Karmakeeper, the protector of the Karma, the life giving force in the worlds. You will travel between various realms, solving the conflicts of the Guardians. Who originally were burdened with the task of maintaining the flow of Karma in the worlds and maintaining the balance in the multi-verse. You will encounter these Guardians (voiced by the previously named rock artists) and learn about their side of each conflict. Through puzzling and platforming you have to bring the long lost Karmaflow back into these worlds, to drive out the unbalanced Karma that led to the destruction of the guardian spirits of these universes.\nBecause it's the Karmakeeper\u2019s job to hear out both sides, you decide who you want to support and thus determine the fate of that world. The way players resolve the conflict on a world influences the overarching story and the game's conclusion at the same time.\n\nKarmaflow sets itself out from other contemporary titles in multiple ways, with the game\u2019s massive emphasis on music being the most obvious. While other video games may treat sound and music design as a nice additional feature, in Karmaflow, music is everything to the game\u2019s experience. The persistent rock opera singing guides the players on an epic journey that changes depending on their choices, which in turn affects the tone of the music heard.\nBasecamp Games will release its first title \"Karmaflow: The Rock Opera Videogame\" on PC and MAC on january 16, 2015.","hypes":7,"rating":50,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":2,"rating_count":2,"games":[55173,24426,56033,19150,20329,54678,20342,26226,23733,19520],"tags":[17,268435463,268435464,268435465,268435487,268435488,536870984,536871029,536871081,536871298,536871415,536872070,536872265,536872266,536872267,536872961,536873787,536874916,536875046,536875257,536875782,536875808,536875869,536875885,536876239,536876268,1073741826],"developers":[4428],"publishers":[4428],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[72,117,169,386,503,1158,1353,1354,1355,2049,2875,4004,4134,4345,4870,4896,4957,4973,5327,5356],"themes":[17],"genres":[7,8,9,31,32],"first_release_date":1421625600000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1421625600000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Jan-19","y":2015,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1430352000000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Apr-30","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1421625600000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jan-19","y":2015,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Karmaflow","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/grkbfrrctifnrwfaexg8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"grkbfrrctifnrwfaexg8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xvnkawpjy2vqdysrxjjo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xvnkawpjy2vqdysrxjjo","width":3838,"height":2154},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xufa6yqlhg22fq0p7kgc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xufa6yqlhg22fq0p7kgc","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/alrhotqz8diyqmdh1gnz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"alrhotqz8diyqmdh1gnz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mqa5u1qarrylhqs7ftrg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mqa5u1qarrylhqs7ftrg","width":1908,"height":1009}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"AIgZDhQVU94"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"rWc2eL4FIWQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s5buqo4tfwvxvwp1ron1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s5buqo4tfwvxvwp1ron1","width":912,"height":1080},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/317940"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.karmaflowgame.com"}],"external":{"steam":"317940"}}
