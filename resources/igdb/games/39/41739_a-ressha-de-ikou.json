The game is played in real time, with a day\/night cycle and a game world that changes regardless of the player's actions. Compared to its more widely known sequels, A Ressha de Ikou has a rather simple gameplay that is confined to building tracks for just one train line, the titular A-train. A report is generated that shows how well the player is doing in his\/her competition against other networks.","collection":1335,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55590,55689,18623,10739,19847,44076,9199,9789,19290],"tags":[268435469,268435471,536871291,536871304,536871906,536872060,536872914,536875058,536875059,536875356,536875361,536876700,536876759,536880383,536880423,536881651],"category":0,"keywords":[379,392,994,1148,2002,4146,4147,4444,4449,5788,5847,9471,9511,10739],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":602294400000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":602294400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Feb-01","y":1989,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wf7itjcz3nsi5bdguich.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wf7itjcz3nsi5bdguich","width":384,"height":261}}
