It is a \"second version\" of Mega Man 8, using many of that game's assets, highly similar gameplay, and even two of its Robot Masters. It takes place about a year after the events of Mega Man 8 and before Mega Man 9, being considered a \"Mega Man 8.5\" both due to its nature and due to a mention in the game's code.[1] It was originally released for the Super Famicom (SNES) exclusively in Japan in 1998, and was later ported to the Game Boy Advance and released worldwide in 2002-2003.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
