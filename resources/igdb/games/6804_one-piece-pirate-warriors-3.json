Players fight hordes of enemy characters and bosses (e.g., marines, pirates) in melee-style combat. Players punch, kick, use special attacks, and wield stylized\/cartoony weapons to defeat enemy forces. Cut scenes occasionally depict characters being struck and killed by swords or gunfire. One attack comically depicts a character emitting flatulence to charge enemies. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters in outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; dialogue that states, \u201cDo you mind if I take a peek at your panties?\u201d During the course of the game, one character is depicted with a cigar in his mouth. The word \u201cbastard\u201d is heard in the game.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/One_Piece:_Pirate_Warriors_3"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.onepiece-game.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/331600"}],"external":{"steam":"331600"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":48,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
