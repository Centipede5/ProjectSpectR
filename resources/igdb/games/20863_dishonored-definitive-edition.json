The city's design is modeled on London and Edinburgh between the late 1800s and the early 1900s. The capital of the Empire of the Isles, Dunwall, is ruled by an oppressive regime that came to power following the assassination of the Empress and the kidnapping of her daughter. The city is a center for fishing and whaling; whale oil is a valuable resource which is needed to power the city. After a philosopher discovered that whale oil\u2014known in the city as trans\u2014can be used as a fuel, the government used it to develop powerful weaponry, which in turn bred government corruption. The city is stricken with a plague spread by rats, which is killing the poor and isolating the rich. The infected, known as \"weepers\", cry blood and can become violent. The government uses the plague as an excuse to take or purge citizens as they wish. Order is maintained by the Tallboys, heavily armored officers on tall, mechanical legs, and districts are separated by barriers known as \"Walls of Light\", which are made of energy and disintegrate unauthorized people who try to cross them. A covert group of activists, the Loyalists, plots to overthrow the government and install the Empress' daughter as the new Empress. \n \n[from Wikipedia.org]","collection":1494,"franchise":1063,"franchises":[1063],"rating":84.1324948161453,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":79.8571428571429,"aggregated_rating_count":7,"total_rating":81.9948188366441,"total_rating_count":26,"rating_count":19,"version_parent":533,"version_title":"Definitive Edition","games":[103054,562,55038,26192,105269,103020,37419,61616,37777,103298],"tags":[1,23,268435461,268435487,536871818,536889317,536890183,536890184,536890185,1073741825],"developers":[19],"publishers":[28,3130],"game_engines":[351],"category":3,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[906,18405,19271,19272,19273],"themes":[1,23],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":1381190400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1440460800000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Aug-25","y":2015,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1381190400000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Oct-08","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1440633600000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Aug-27","y":2015,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1440633600000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Aug-27","y":2015,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1440720000000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Aug-28","y":2015,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bczloijz1mswgdho021f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bczloijz1mswgdho021f","width":1980,"height":1184},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yhbiib6h60kpqm3pyfhv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yhbiib6h60kpqm3pyfhv","width":1980,"height":1114},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d4pyidlznvr5hc5zdedw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d4pyidlznvr5hc5zdedw","width":1980,"height":1096},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r2ikbnyz6q1i1norkljg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r2ikbnyz6q1i1norkljg","width":7308,"height":4568},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cknxefnbrlfw6ewtmjtn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cknxefnbrlfw6ewtmjtn","width":7648,"height":4304}],"videos":[{"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"UhfLtJlwlns"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h5htytbjedawcrq7cxrn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h5htytbjedawcrq7cxrn","width":1527,"height":1935},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action game in which players assume the role of Corvo, a royal bodyguard who has been framed for treason (i.e., assassinating an empress). As players help Corvo exact revenge on those who betrayed him, they can use pistols, crossbows, swords, and grenades to kill human enemies in ranged and melee-style combat. Violence is sometimes accompanied by slow-motion effects and gurgling sounds from Corvo's victims. Certain weapons result in dismembered limbs, and attacks are accompanied by exaggerated blood-splatter effects. Some environments depict mutilated corpses on the ground or hanging from the ceiling. During one interactive sequence, Corvo brands a restrained man's cheek with a hot iron; in another, players use electric shocks to interrogate a blindfolded man in a chair. The game depicts some female characters in revealing outfits and includes some sexual\/suggestive dialogue (e.g., \u201cHey sweetheart, you want to play with me? You're a lot cuter than my regulars,\u201d \u201cThis one thinks only of whores,\u201d and \u201cSell your wife into prostitution, I'm sure I can get you a good price.\u201d). The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can also be heard in the game.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/sub\/31292"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/BethesdaFR"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/BethesdaSoftworks"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dishonored"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Dishonored"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dishonored"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/dishonored.wikia.com"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/dishonored.bethesda.net"}]}
