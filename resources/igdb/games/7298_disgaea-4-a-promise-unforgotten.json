From a 3\/4\u2013overhead perspective, players use swords, axes, and magic spells to engage monsters and human-like characters in turn-based combat (e.g., selecting attacks\/weapons from a menu screen). Battles are accompanied by light effects, slashing sounds, and cries of pain; enemies disappear when defeated. One special attack depicts a bullet striking an enemy's head, which is accompanied by slow-motion and X-ray effects. A few cutscenes depict brief stylized blood effects (e.g., an armored knight emitting blue droplets after getting impaled; the silhouette of blood splatter after a character is struck). During the course of the game, some of the dialogue includes suggestive comments (e.g., \u201cYou've earned the right to be called a pervert, by sneaking around and peeping on us,\u201d \u201cI just love it when men do things that constitute sexual harassment,\u201d and \u201cYou're so flat, they use your chest to measure if a shelf is straight!\u201d). The game also contains a brief drug reference (e.g., \u201cIf you inhale my dust, you'll get really happy. It might even make you feel like you can fly . . . Just say no, kids! Bad! Bad drugs!\u201d). The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201ca*s,\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d can be heard in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/disgaea.us\/d4\/"}]}
