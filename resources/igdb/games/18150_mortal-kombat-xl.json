Players punch, kick, and use special attacks (e.g., guns, fireballs, ice blasts, lightning strikes) to drain opponents' life meters. Battles are accompanied by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and exaggerated impact sounds. Large blood-splatter effects occur during fights, staining characters' bodies as well as the ground. Additional attacks include x-ray views of opponents' bones, ligaments, and organs shattering\/bursting apart. After an opponent is defeated at the end of a match, players can perform finishing moves called \u201cFatalities\u201d that can result in impalements, dismemberment, or decapitation. Many finishing moves depict over-the-top instances of violence and gore: a character ripped in half; a character's face sliced off with a sword; a character mauling an opponent's torso, leaving entrails exposed. One character uses \u201cdrunken master\u201d-style fighting, swigging repeatedly from a flask to reach higher levels of drunkenness and unlock specific moves\/combos; the character's fatality move also involves use of alcohol. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/sub\/128345"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortal_Kombat_X"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":10,"offlinemax":2}]}
