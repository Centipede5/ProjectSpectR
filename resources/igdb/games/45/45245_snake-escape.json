{"id":45245,"name":"Snake Escape","slug":"snake-escape","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/snake-escape","created_at":1499458395923,"updated_at":1500536502579,"summary":"Guide a snake through increasingly difficult mazes in order to escape and reach the food... featuring: \nCode and levels (converted and new) by myself \nAwesome graphics by top artist BiNMaN \nAwesome soundtrack by top composer MmcM \nOriginal concept by Tommi Tuovinen \n \nThis game is based on a webgame called LIME RICK, although with a modified design. Many maze levels were \"improved\" from the original (hardest levels became even harder), and there are also 4 extra (extremely hard) new levels at the end. Can you solve them all??? \n \nDownload it now from here and have fun! \n \nNOTE: Play it on a ZX-Spectrum 128K model otherwise you will miss the AY music! \n \nNOTE2: This game uses multicolor graphics powered by NIRVANA+ Engine, so it will work on all original ZX-Spectrum models without the need for additional hardware. It should also work on any accurate emulator, including the ZX Vega.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1482796800000,"platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":1482796800000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Dec-27","y":2016,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kwmz5zlb0qdlbjwih19o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kwmz5zlb0qdlbjwih19o","width":1019,"height":734}]}
