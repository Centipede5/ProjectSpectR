It supports chain commands and adverb recognition, and goes beyond by adding support of mouse input and interface customization. These features are enabled on a menu that pops up when right-clicking on the screen. \n \nThe optional verb menu allows complete sentence construction with the mouse. The interface can be changed to several different ways of displaying text, from a Zorkish traditional full screen output to a scrolling window.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[13189,11296,25646,26914,28289,27266,54678,25222,18011,41895],"tags":[19,268435487,536871130,536871939,536872032,536873308,1073741829],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[218,1027,1120,2396],"themes":[19],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o7qecvkext1loruvuxnf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o7qecvkext1loruvuxnf","width":640,"height":400}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vsi3pwb4jlsrn9kgwu6o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vsi3pwb4jlsrn9kgwu6o","width":640,"height":776}}
