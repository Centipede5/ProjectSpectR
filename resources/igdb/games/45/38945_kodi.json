Kodi runs on Linux, OS X, Windows, iOS, and Android, featuring a 10-foot user interface for use with televisions and remote controls. It allows users to play and view most videos, music, podcasts, and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet. Our forums and Wiki are bursting with knowledge and help for the new user right up to the application developer. We also have helpful Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Youtube pages. \n \nIMPORTANT: \nThe official Kodi version does not contain any content what so ever. This means that you should provide your own content from a local or remote storage location, DVD, Blu-Ray or any other media carrier that you own. Additionally Kodi allows you to install third-party plugins that may provide access to content that is freely available on the official content provider website. The watching or listening of illegal or pirated content which would otherwise need to be paid for is not endorsed or approved by Team Kodi.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28558,44242,28465,34919,3278,26563,33603,36962,55888,65827],"tags":[33,268435469],"category":0,"themes":[33],"genres":[13],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tc9r1yiw2vtr6j4s0vn6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tc9r1yiw2vtr6j4s0vn6","width":1920,"height":1080}]}
