You play as Megaman's sister ROLL, but not the Roll based on the Japanese Canon, but the Ruby Spears MegaMan Cartoon. \n \nThere are now 4 difficulty levels (easy-normal-hard & one-hit). You choose one main weapon (straight-spread-charge or burst) and one sub-weapon (vacuum-toaster-saw). You can also now choose between fighting 1 or 2 bosses at the same time (mono-melee) regardless of difficulty level. \n \nDuring battles you can grab your enemy and absorb their power and use it against them. She can even perform some physical attacks such as a drop kick. You also have a super meter that allows you to perform a SUPER MOVE. Based on what weapon you're currently using, you can perform different SUPER MOVES. \n \nEach boss has a weakness, much like every other megaman game. At the end of each battle, you're given a grade based upon your performance, an information Token, and a Password.","popularity":1,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1404172800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":1404172800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jul-01","y":2014,"m":7}]}
