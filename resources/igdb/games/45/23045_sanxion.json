The side-scroller speed is controllable, increasing the closer the player is to the center of the screen. The screen is divided in two sections, the upper one with a cenital view, and the lower one, taking up two-thirds of the screen, shows a typical side view. Enemies can come from both sides of the screen in close formations that the player must avoid colliding with.","collection":878,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[28029,68287,36950,64204,76246,27314,10039,19341,25311,76722],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871872,536871969,536879695,1073741828,1073741827],"developers":[7146],"publishers":[7146],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[960,1057,8783],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[15,26,64],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":64,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986-Dec-31","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cmz0dbwc0us7qcpcmszm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cmz0dbwc0us7qcpcmszm","width":1000,"height":1392}}
