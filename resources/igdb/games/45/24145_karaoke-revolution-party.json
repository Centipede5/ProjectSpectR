Along with the trademark vocal lines that scroll across the screen there are now occasional directional arrows to tell gamers when to jump on a particular direction. This is far from the aerobic insanity of the DDR games which can easily build up a sweat as dancers frantically try to keep putting their feet in the right place. Instead, the mode offers more of a light choreography addition to the game. Instead of the usual three dozen songs that the previous games have included, KRP sports 50 tracks that include some classics like \"Sweet Caroline\" and \"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\" as well as modern hits like \"Crazy in Love\" and \"I Don't Wanna Be.\"","collection":4421,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":77.5,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":77.5,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[44242,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,55590,55689,22406,23867],"tags":[268435463,268435469,536871669,536872060,536875049,536875387,536875751,536875802,536880245,536880676,536882190,536884021,536886400],"category":0,"keywords":[757,1148,4137,4475,4839,4890,9333,9764,11278,13109,15488],"genres":[7,13],"first_release_date":1134000000000,"platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1134000000000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Dec-08","y":2005,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/himgronkklzft5uoyr4j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"himgronkklzft5uoyr4j","width":640,"height":770},"esrb":{"rating":4}}
