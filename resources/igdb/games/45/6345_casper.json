She's after the treasure she thinks is hidden in the walls. Casper will need the help of Dr James Harvey - therapist to the dead - if he has any hope of succeeding in his adventures. \n \nCasper will also have to deal with his uncles - Stretch, Stinkie and Fatso, who just love to scare \"Fleshies\" and thwart Casper's efforts. The gameplay is 3d - and is mostly puzzle solving, with Casper able to take a variety of forms and manipulating objects.","collection":3417,"franchise":186,"franchises":[186],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":40,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[20342,36553,35371,9244,103054,23345,30229,19001,34155,24426],"tags":[1,22,27,34,268435464,268435471,268435487,536870928,536871063,536871262,536871446,536871971,536872131,536872216,536872349,536872847,536872961,536874055,536874694,536875054,536875073,536875088,536875151,536875209,536875241,536875291,536875294,536875396,536875404,536875517,536875590,536876007,536876353,536876694,1073741828],"developers":[716,1000,2774,458],"publishers":[716,2773,1882],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[16,151,350,534,1059,1219,1304,1437,1935,2049,3143,3782,4142,4161,4176,4239,4297,4329,4379,4382,4484,4492,4605,4678,5095,5441,5782],"themes":[1,22,27,34],"genres":[8,15,31],"first_release_date":846806400000,"platforms":[50,22,32,7,19,33,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":858297600000,"human":"1997-Mar-14","y":1997,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":858297600000,"human":"1997-Mar-14","y":1997,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":858297600000,"human":"1997-Mar-14","y":1997,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":858297600000,"human":"1997-Mar-14","y":1997,"m":3},{"category":1,"platform":33,"date":846806400000,"human":"1996-Nov","y":1996,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":973209600000,"human":"2000-Nov-03","y":2000,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":50,"date":973209600000,"human":"2000-Nov-03","y":2000,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Beethoven's 2nd","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nxnuexz43dhrvzqxcnqx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nxnuexz43dhrvzqxcnqx","width":720,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xp0zfihzjbc1rkoyolh1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xp0zfihzjbc1rkoyolh1","width":720,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vjrjdi8xsn3usqxn2rcg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vjrjdi8xsn3usqxn2rcg","width":720,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g90pqqcww37ncrtqijfu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g90pqqcww37ncrtqijfu","width":220,"height":150}}
