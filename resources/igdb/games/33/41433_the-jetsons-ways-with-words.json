Fly George Jetson's spacecraft around a network of platforms to collect up letters that form a word. The letters drift around the network, and will even try to get away from your spaceship when you get close. When you touch the right letter in the right order, you earn points, but touch a letter that doesn't belong and you lose them. If you collect letters out of order you don't earn as many points. On the higher levels you also have to dodge robots and satellites, which cost more points if you hit them.","collection":4932,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,50904,50709,79896,76602,73833,73002,69993,69885,66855],"tags":[34,268435465,536871446,536875054],"category":0,"keywords":[534,4142],"themes":[34],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s8gpu94ojfpk8cfyqd9a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s8gpu94ojfpk8cfyqd9a","width":318,"height":430}}
