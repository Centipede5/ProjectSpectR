Force is a turn-based tactics game. During each round, the player assigns orders to the men, e.g. moving, firing or special actions, which are then simultaneously (together with the AI's choices) performed. There is a strategical map (shows the whole mission area) and the closer zoomed in tactical map. As expected, the three fire commands are especially important: the usual direct fire at an enemy, targeting a specific spot or an opportunity fire which gets triggered by passing by enemies. The environment, e.g. hedges buildings, may be used as cover and affects the line of sight.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9760,21642,55029,11362,33603,36962,55888,73075,12982,65827],"tags":[39,268435471,1073741827],"developers":[1356],"publishers":[1356],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"themes":[39],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m0n8atexlttlafne5ubf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m0n8atexlttlafne5ubf","width":630,"height":894}}
