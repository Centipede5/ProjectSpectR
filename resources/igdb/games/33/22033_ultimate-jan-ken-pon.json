It is an online battle game based on the rules of the famous Rock Paper Scissors game.\n\nDynamic and fun, players collect, train and equip their \u201c guardian spirits \u201c who thanks to the means of unique delirious special moves, confront online opponents.\n\nStrategy, reflex, dexterity and rhythm echo the traditional origins of \u201cJAN KEN PON\u2033. This comic and whacky game takes place in a world influenced by Asian culture and manga.\n\nFrequent updates will be bringing new characters and a story mode is already in preparation.","storyline":"The game takes place in a crazy world inspired by medieval Japan and populated by anthropomorphic animals of all kinds. The player starts the story by reaching the only \u201cJan Ken Pon\u201d dojo in the region, in the hope of being chosen by the Master of the dojo and so becoming an \u201capprentice\u201d. \n\nAt that point, the apprentices will be assigned a spirit guardian who will allow them to transcend the combat techniques of \u201cJan Ken Pon\u201d. They will discover that it is then possible to achieve a perfect partnership with their spirit guardians in order to perform special moves called \"Jin\u2019rais\".\n\nUnfortunately, just after their arrival, an apprentice will go to a cursed place in the dojo and release all the evil energy which was confined.\n\nThe balance of the world will then be broken. Who will manage to reestablish it?","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25640,10039,25311,1875,36794,36608,12982,36609,34919,2907],"tags":[1,268435460,268435471,536871004,1073741828],"developers":[10505],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[92],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,15],"first_release_date":1467331200000,"status":4,"platforms":[34],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1467331200000,"human":"2016-Jul-01","y":2016,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cahuicspj2l41kngybeq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cahuicspj2l41kngybeq","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wjdnqtewzi15wdkk2chx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wjdnqtewzi15wdkk2chx","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ecfxr7gdzdgyuk3k5p0z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ecfxr7gdzdgyuk3k5p0z","width":1897,"height":965},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/udfggql3mw63q3eqz9ib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"udfggql3mw63q3eqz9ib","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"4R8ZwmZXE2U"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/efxovlvsggjrejt2t0gx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"efxovlvsggjrejt2t0gx","width":1920,"height":1080},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/ultimate-jkp.com"}]}
