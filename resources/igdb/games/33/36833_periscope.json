Interior scenery inside the machine is lit up with a blacklight tube. It consists of a backdrop representing the ocean, where cardboard cutouts of ships are moved horizontally on chains. In front of this is a horizontal board with a grid of lights that represents the torpedoes moving toward the ships in side-scrolling fashion. The game is played looking through a simulated submarine periscope that limits the field of view so the horizontal and vertical playfields appear to be almost continuous. Due to the relatively large horizontal surface, and the machinery behind the vertical surface, the game cabinet is very deep, two to three times the depth of a conventional arcade game.","popularity":3.666666666666667,"games":[83728,102868,113111,55213,19686,18467,76747,103301,105049,76424],"tags":[39,268435461,268435486,268435489,536871051,536871846],"developers":[263],"category":0,"keywords":[139,934],"themes":[39],"genres":[5,30,33],"first_release_date":-126316800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":-126316800000,"region":5,"human":"1965","y":1965,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":" Sega Enterprises's Periscope"},{"name":"\u30da\u30ea\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30d7","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ddyy85lalfrlpgudm6cm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ddyy85lalfrlpgudm6cm","width":320,"height":265},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qbkor3i9x95qs10dxtal.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qbkor3i9x95qs10dxtal","width":320,"height":240}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/znp9orri52lpfpytohsl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"znp9orri52lpfpytohsl","width":458,"height":599}}
