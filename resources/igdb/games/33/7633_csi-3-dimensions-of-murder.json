The first four ultimately connect together towards solving the 5th. Your co-workers are characters from the CSI television series and voice acting is done by the real actors and actresses from the show. \n \nChoose one of 3 levels of difficulty depending upon how familiar you are with the tv shows (and computer gaming in general). Those modes affect how much interactive help you receive inside the game - not from your co-workers, but by way of hotspots and evidence analysis. The game features a tutorial to help with the interface, which is point and click.","collection":1031,"franchise":288,"franchises":[288],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":65,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":65,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1142294400000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":1142294400000,"human":"2006-Mar-14","y":2006,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xevbeq5cqfsrnwebs9b5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xevbeq5cqfsrnwebs9b5","width":640,"height":818},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/CSI:_3_Dimensions_of_Murder"}]}
