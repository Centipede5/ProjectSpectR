By 2015, the app had been downloaded 100 million times.\n\nIn July 2015, SongPop 2, featuring over 100,000 songs and 1,000 curated playlists, was released. SongPop 2 is free-to-play with in-app purchases.\n\nThe game is played much like the popular TV show \"Name That Tune.\" After selecting a themed playlist, five songs are played. Players compete against each other to be the first to select the correct song title or artist from a choice of four. iTune links are provided for each song.[5] In SongPop 2, users can play alone for the first time, competing against a computer-controlled opponent.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75245,6080,101956,101659,100916,100909,100767,99181,95874,88903],"tags":[268435463,1073741829],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1,2],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1335830400000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1335830400000,"region":8,"human":"2012-May-01","y":2012,"m":5}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jziqldqx559fxhdhkkep.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jziqldqx559fxhdhkkep","width":233,"height":216}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"EGXVna_1xsE"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nmjoetzulnhys0poyilx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nmjoetzulnhys0poyilx","width":233,"height":216}}
