When batting, the D-pad moves around and A and C swing. When pitching, Left and Right move around and C pitches. Unlike most, if not all, Mega Drive baseball games, however, you can also take control of the rest of the team when the ball has been hit: you control the player with the ball; the D-pad moves around and C throws the ball.","popularity":1,"games":[37872,37833,78876,78743,72830,63563,48827,47746,44429,42733],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536875141,536877981],"category":0,"keywords":[20,4229,7069],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":806284800000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":806284800000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Jul-21","y":1995,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":808963200000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Aug-21","y":1995,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hmql0oecuvkweqo8cnpt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hmql0oecuvkweqo8cnpt","width":275,"height":387}}
