{"id":1133,"name":"Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance","slug":"castlevania-harmony-of-dissonance","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/castlevania-harmony-of-dissonance","created_at":1340741999444,"updated_at":1546082873561,"summary":"Nearly fifty years has past since Simon Belmont rescued the land from the curse of Dracula. Now, Simon's descendant Juste Belmont, must acquire the relics of Dracula to unravel the disappearance of his childhood friend Lydie. The castle's enchanting mysteries and danger await all those who dare enter.","storyline":"Juste meets Maxim at a castle where Lydie is being held captive; after a brief talk, he leaves Maxim outside and begins to explore the castle. Within the castle, Juste encounters Death, who confirms that the castle is Dracula's. He then meets up with a dazed Maxim, whose memory is slowly returning to him, and they split up to cover more ground. While trekking through the castle, Juste notices that the castle sometimes has different atmospheres. He continues to encounter Maxim, but is baffled by how his friend seems to change personalities periodically. Regardless, in one of their meetings, Maxim reveals that he went on a journey to find and destroy the remains of Dracula, something Simon Belmont had previously done, but when he collected all six, his memory went blank. \n \nJuste encounters Death again, who explains that the castle has been split in two \"layers\" to accommodate the two spirits living in Maxim's body: his original spirit and an evil one created from Dracula's remains and his suppressed jealousy of Juste. Maxim later confirms this and admits to being Lydie's kidnapper. Juste meets his friend again in the other layer of the castle where he reveals that he lost his memory to protect Lydie. He then gives Juste his bracelet to help him locate her in the castle. However, when Juste finds her, Death kidnaps her to use her blood as a means to unite the two castles by destroying Maxim's spirit. Juste defeats Death, and proceeds to search for Maxim. Along the way, he accumulates Dracula's remains, which are scattered throughout the castle. In the center of the castle, he finds Maxim with an unconscious Lydie. \n \nThree endings exist. In the first, Maxim, possessed, has already bitten Lydie. With Maxim's defeat, Juste escapes the collapsing castle alone and curses his inability to save either friend. In the second, Maxim struggles against the possession and urges Juste to kill him. In his final moments, he thanks Juste for killing him and reveals that he had wished to save him from his fate as a Belmont. Outside the castle, Lydie awakens, unharmed, and tells Juste not to blame himself for Maxim's death. The third ending begins the same as the first, except that, during the fight, Maxim notices that Juste wore his bracelet and resists the possession. Dracula flees into a weakened form using the gathered remains and fights Juste, planning to use his blood to return himself to full power. Vanquishing him, Juste escapes the castle together with Maxim and Lydie, whose bite marks disappear by the time she regains consciousness. Outside the castle, the three resolve to return home.","collection":65,"franchise":895,"franchises":[895],"rating":69.8256762043562,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"total_rating":69.8256762043562,"total_rating_count":21,"rating_count":21,"games":[78632,106987,107926,103312,81249,80916,101608,109463,29032,25311],"tags":[1,268435464,268435468,268435487,1073741828],"developers":[159],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,12,31],"first_release_date":1023321600000,"platforms":[41,24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1424304000000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Feb-19","y":2015,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1413417600000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Oct-16","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1023321600000,"human":"2002-Jun-06","y":2002,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Castlevania: Concerto of Midnight Sun","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bmuqwtszhawuqkadtbge.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bmuqwtszhawuqkadtbge","width":482,"height":322},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o08tjqojy2vldrem4ao6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o08tjqojy2vldrem4ao6","width":480,"height":321},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dhec09rwqf0h1og56of7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dhec09rwqf0h1og56of7","width":480,"height":322},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gjj70shcqouwjpmfisi2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gjj70shcqouwjpmfisi2","width":480,"height":319},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u1m8hbyg2heq0zpsncmd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u1m8hbyg2heq0zpsncmd","width":480,"height":320},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hmq10nomgkfnfzwszcmf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hmq10nomgkfnfzwszcmf","width":480,"height":321},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tjcm1rjqowzlqauozpe6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tjcm1rjqowzlqauozpe6","width":350,"height":230},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jcrljlars7ttcola7hjm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jcrljlars7ttcola7hjm","width":1221,"height":811},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n8bs4stthsvnxfcdfemh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n8bs4stthsvnxfcdfemh","width":1219,"height":809},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d3md3qnalnilxfqva83d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d3md3qnalnilxfqva83d","width":1217,"height":809},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u0hqkt5msles24rk2bkq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u0hqkt5msles24rk2bkq","width":1219,"height":811}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1icf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1icf","width":590,"height":582},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Castlevania:_Harmony_of_Dissonance"}]}
