These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens. \n \nGame play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface. \n \nAs there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.","collection":3715,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[60294,6685,49057,40292,48285,37932,35626,61416,57050,38163],"tags":[268435470,536870942,536874813,536875140,536875151,536875626,536875627],"category":0,"keywords":[30,3901,4228,4239,4714,4715],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pebble Beach no Hotou","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qy0geg9tag6e9wazvu1c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qy0geg9tag6e9wazvu1c","width":800,"height":1110}}
