It is based on the Shannara series of books by Terry Brooks. \nThe game has some elements taken from RPGs, such as top-down world-map traveling and occasional turn-based battles. However, there is no real role-playing system in the game (statistics, experience points, levels, etc.). The battles serve to emphasize the danger of traveling the wilderness, or appear as story-related events; sometimes, they are treated like puzzles, with specific actions leading to victory.","franchise":54,"franchises":[54],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[36534,18398,47823,26766,36926,12632,11214,36792,26163,55092],"tags":[17,268435468,268435487,536871115,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871938,536871939,536875243,1073741825],"developers":[560],"publishers":[560],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[203,226,227,296,1026,1027,4331],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":820368000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/obf5mtr0p3kneyfdnuxc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"obf5mtr0p3kneyfdnuxc","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iz5xfe0kgsmzm0zbsevs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iz5xfe0kgsmzm0zbsevs","width":640,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fak7qofup272vwxx1naz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fak7qofup272vwxx1naz","width":252,"height":332}}
