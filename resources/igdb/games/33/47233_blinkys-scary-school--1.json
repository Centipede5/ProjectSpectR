He does this by collecting the right objects to cast the all important spells. \n \nThe levels themselves scroll sideways and are layered with platforms. Making the task difficult are spiders, mice and the like - watch out in particular for the jumping frogs. Once the appropriate spells have been cast (involving lots of back-tracking to collect objects and bring them to the cauldron) the objects to make an underwater diving suit must be obtained.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}]}
