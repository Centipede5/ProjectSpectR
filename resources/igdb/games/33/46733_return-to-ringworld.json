Once in Ringworld they'll try to uncover some evidence to clear their names, but they stumble across another universe-threatening plot. This time U.N. general Carson Teal is out to rule the universe by uncovering Ringworld's secrets, and you must stop him. \n \nReturn to Ringworld is the sequel to the Ringworld: Revenge of the Patriarch. Like its predecessor, it is based on Larry Niven's Known Space series of novels. Once again this game is a puzzle-solving point-and-click adventure. This game is much larger than its predecessor, with hundreds of screens, mazes, etc. The player can control three characters throughout the game, a la Day of the Tentacle.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27314,26766,19448,25300,36950,13189,17469,25222,25311,41895],"tags":[18,268435487,536871882,536871939,536872098,536875243],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1027,1186,4331],"themes":[18],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":768009600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":768009600000,"region":8,"human":"1994-May-04","y":1994,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zhcm7ygmoqcbn9ie2h28.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zhcm7ygmoqcbn9ie2h28","width":280,"height":280}}
