You can now collect coins in the levels to purchase items from Tiki Village, such as meat to recover your health, or even remodel your hut back at your home village. The game also uses a password system to track your progress. The game also shifts to an overhead map so you can wander to whichever level you wish, and return to completed levels to earn more money or power-ups.","collection":3743,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[81249,96437,103054,19448,27314,36950,27316,37419,78149,101211],"tags":[1,268435487,536871213,536871519,536871570,536871939,536872282,536872690,536873064,536875073,536875201,536875452,536876419,536876991,536877124,536878192,536878199,536880227],"category":0,"keywords":[301,607,658,1027,1370,1778,2152,4161,4289,4540,5507,6079,6212,7280,7287,9315],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":763948800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":763948800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Mar-18","y":1994,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Joe & Mac 3: Lost in the Tropics, Tatake Genshijin 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tkyskvoehaylrdk700sb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tkyskvoehaylrdk700sb","width":2100,"height":1551}}
