Route-16 Turbo takes the concept established in Route 16, and updates the quality of the graphics, but keeps the goal of the game the same. The game play is a near perfect combination of Rally-X and Venture. The player drives a car through several zoomed in blocks collecting bags of money and other items, and travels between blocks along a zoomed out view of the world.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":499910400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":499910400000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Nov-04","y":1985,"m":11}]}
