The locals' insults towards superstitious fears (\"Slap an Alien\") were a welcome party for the Martians ready to strike. You are a fully qualified Earthlink and must pilot your ship to stop the alien invasion by manipulating the ground-based firepower of Earthlink Command and prevent the aliens from taking over our beloved planet Earth. \n \nThe game features more than 30 missions of futuristic action with many secret levels, ships and weapons. Your prime directive is to kill all invading alien forces. However, whenever Earthlink Command wants you to complete a specific objective, you will be notified via a flashing communications icon. \n \nYour ship features a radar, cargo hold, weapon mounts, aiming reticule and the Suck-O-Matic. The Suck-O-Matic is an experimental device used to teleport and blow items in and out of your ship's cargo hold. It is an essential part for much of the game's objectives.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":76,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":76,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[28029,68287,36950,76246,64204,76722,19341,10039,27314,25311],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536875194,536876237,1073741826],"developers":[1959],"publishers":[205],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[4282,5325],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":909878400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":7,"date":909878400000,"human":"1998-Nov","y":1998,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"B-Movie","comment":"European Title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/usozb0apfegx9yby35jq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"usozb0apfegx9yby35jq","width":593,"height":622},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
