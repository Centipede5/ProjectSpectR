This is accomplished by travelling between different solar systems and interacting with the systems and their inhabitants.Travelling is in itself quite challenging. Inside a solar system you can fly between planets and scan them to see if they contain anything interesting, such as minerals or energy readings. But to travel between systems you must enter Hyperspace, a strange dimension where a mysterious drag slows you down but distances are much smaller. Thankfully you have a trusty starmap, which makes navigating this bizarre place much easier.","collection":234,"rating":87.4407197975569,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":87.4407197975569,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":5,"games":[13189,11296,18011,26658,33822,51524,76397,56033,54678,25646],"tags":[19,268435471,268435487,536871130,536871939,536872032,536873308,536873580,536874115,536875172,536875324,536876587,536878561,536879585,536879695,536884867,536885978],"category":0,"keywords":[218,1027,1120,2396,2668,3203,4260,4412,5675,7649,8673,8783,13955,15066],"themes":[19],"genres":[15,31],"first_release_date":788832000000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[50],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":50,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qoeqfcqb9m6loputxkvf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qoeqfcqb9m6loputxkvf","width":2000,"height":2541}}
