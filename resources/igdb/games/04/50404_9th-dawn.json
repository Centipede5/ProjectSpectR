It harkens back to the days of Ultima 4 or 5, or similar tile based games of the mid to late 1980s. The game took quite a long time to finish so there is a lot to see and explore in 9th Dawn. 9th Dawn II is in the works and I for one look forward to that.","collection":3286,"popularity":1,"games":[36926,59516,47823,12632,55289,26766,25300,18398,25311,36534],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536871208,536871938,536871939],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,1027],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,31],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jaxp0tuowfu8h5znseh5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jaxp0tuowfu8h5znseh5","width":854,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qcnf9m37i8h2rqahsahi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qcnf9m37i8h2rqahsahi","width":432,"height":561}}
