To make matters more interesting, scattered around the playing field are a number of \"incubators,\" which can hatch either more spores or, at later levels (or in early levels, in more advanced difficulty levels), more aliens. Use your ship's weapons to blast the spores before they can make new aliens, and blast any aliens before they can devour you.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,142,71455,27314,27523,25300,14364],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871882,536871937],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1025],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":349833600000,"platforms":[129],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":129,"date":349833600000,"region":8,"human":"1981-Feb-01","y":1981,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vxxqtysoyeliqa9keckt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vxxqtysoyeliqa9keckt","width":824,"height":1189}}
