The game will continue to expand with new content added through patches. There is currently a Japanese, Korean and Chinese (Taiwan and Macau) version of Frontier. The game has a built-in IP blocker that prevents IP addresses outside of Japan from connecting to the server, but it is still possible for residents in other countries to connect. The Korean Frontier requires a KSSN (Korean Social Security Number) in order to play but it does not carry the same monthly fee as the Japanese version.","collection":2948,"franchise":824,"franchises":[824],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,51213,103337,15452,104236,35737,18862,16587,103303],"tags":[268435468,1073741826],"developers":[37],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[174],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1182384000000,"platforms":[6,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1277337600000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Jun-24","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1182384000000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Jun-21","y":2007,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc \u30d5\u30ed\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2 \u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tndwlbctbbyngodr7hyp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tndwlbctbbyngodr7hyp","width":178,"height":250},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monster_Hunter_Frontier_Online"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/monsterhunter.wikia.com\/wiki\/Monster_Hunter_Frontier"}]}
