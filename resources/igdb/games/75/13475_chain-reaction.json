Players control a little clown at the bottom of their playfields and try to arrange groups of tiles to make them disappear before a tile reaches past the bottom of the playfield. This is done by pulling down similar tiles (and throwing them back up) to match. \n \nThe game includes two game modes: the one-player score-based Solo Play (where additional lines of tiles regularly drop from the top of the screen) and two-player competitive Battle Mode (where the second player can be human or CPU opponents). Similar to Tetris Attack, players can make \"chain reactions\" by quickly creating near-simultaneous matches to either boost their score (in Solo Play) or fill up more of their opponent's playfield (in Battle Mode).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55590,9199,18623,55036,19934,55689,23345,19376,11419],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536872060,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,3782],"genres":[9,13,15],"first_release_date":802137600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":802137600000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jun-03","y":1995,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rhretgupz81woo47nlw4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rhretgupz81woo47nlw4","width":611,"height":598}}
