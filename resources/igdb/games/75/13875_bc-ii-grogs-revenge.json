Now he must discover the Meaning of Life. But it won't be easy. The Meaning of Life is hidden away; somewhere in a long maze of mountains. \n \nEach mountain is covered with clams and Thor needs to gather 100 clams in order to pay the tolls and advance through each mountain. The only way to Peter and the toll bridge is through the \"real scary caves\". There are lots of clams in the caves but watch out for stalagmites. Keep Thor's headlight sweeping back and forth for maximum clams. \n \nOut of the cave, watch out for Grog, who saves clams from Thor.
