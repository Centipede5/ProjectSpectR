The gameplay involves up to 4 players, which can be either human or computer, each taking on spots of a particular colour. Starting from opposite corners, they take it in turns to move, either by 'reproducing' one of their spots to form another one in an adjacent square, or by making a jump, losing the square you did have but taking one two spaces away.","collection":4445,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,23345,19376,55036,55590,18167,19934,11588,14047,18918],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536872098,536872273,536874694,536875074,536875666,536875727,536878084,536878505,536879868],"category":0,"keywords":[1186,1361,3782,4162,4754,4815,7172,7593,8956],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":654739200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":654739200000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Oct-01","y":1990,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uf8syvvgzuyv3e6f3msi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uf8syvvgzuyv3e6f3msi","width":1528,"height":2100}}
