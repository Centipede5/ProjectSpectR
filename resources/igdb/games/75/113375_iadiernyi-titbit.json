It tells a story of young man Anton who is doped, then robbed and left alone without money and cloth in unfamiliar city during his vacation. The game contains lots of Russian culture references and stoner jokes. The gameplay is classical for point-and-click games: you will need to collect objects, combine them and use in appropriate (and not quite appropriate) situations.","popularity":2,"games":[236,25222,102087,27725,2274,27266,18011,22477,61,29646],"tags":[27,42,268435458,268435465,268435487,1073741826],"developers":[17081],"publishers":[2992],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[27,42],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":1045785600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1045785600000,"region":1,"human":"2003-Feb-21","y":2003,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Nuclear Titbit","comment":"English title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rhg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rhg","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rhf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rhf","width":1067,"height":800}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"nmP7ghbXI0Y"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1i58.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1i58","width":797,"height":800},"esrb":{"rating":7},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/ru.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/%D0%AF%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%82_(%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D1%8C%D1%8E%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0)"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.buka.ru\/cgi-bin\/show.pl?id=6"}]}
