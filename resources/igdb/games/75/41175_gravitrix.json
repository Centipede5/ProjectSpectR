ALL of the stones of EACH colour must be connected in a single 'group' in order for them to vanish, ie. you cannot have multiple, unconnected groups of the same colour in different areas of the screen. The big challenge in GRAVITRIX is that the stones don't just have different colours - they have different 'directions' (or gravity) as well! \n \nEach coloured stone 'falls' in its assigned direction (symbolised by an arrow) whenever there is nothing blocking its path, and this leads to some tricky chain reactions that must be solved. To make your life even harder there is also a time limit, environmental blocks and other gameplay elements that are introduced during the early levels. \n \nGRAVITRIX features: \n \n Hours of puzzle-solving action! \n Two 5.25\" floppy disks worth of artwork and music! \n Password save system! \n Super-fast loading (512KB cartridge version only)! \n Full NTSC\/PAL support!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1438128000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":1438128000000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jul-29","y":2015,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qe4v4mtyapcnfcytgpez.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qe4v4mtyapcnfcytgpez","width":1500,"height":420}}
