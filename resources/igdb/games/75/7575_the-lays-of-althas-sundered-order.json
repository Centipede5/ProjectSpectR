The game will feature an expansive, living world that will evolve and grow by itself, instead of revolving around the player\u2019s actions.\nThe game is currently planned to be released Chapter by Chapter, with each bringing new regional content and gameplay features.","storyline":"Ever since it's early history, Althas has been a land shaken by conflicts. In the early days, these conflicts pitted the Anointed Kingdoms of Men against dark and demonic forces that threatened them. However, with the passage of time, the world has changed: the Anointed order is eroding away and new powers are rising. Another war looms on the horizon, a war of personal and political motivation. Thenodar, a burgeoning new kingdom in the North, and Anorthile, one of the last of the three remaining Anointed Kingdoms, now prepare for a war that will shake all of Althas. Old demons and new enemies gather in the shadows of both lands as each sets their sights on the ruined wilderness known as the Feralands.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[16468,26163,72412,75813,13196,47823,55289,19698,5613,55272],"tags":[17,268435468,268435488],"developers":[3149],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,32],"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zav2sc0osznb2rinvrhp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zav2sc0osznb2rinvrhp","width":1920,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sxfkw47xydx3ymm9hfkz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sxfkw47xydx3ymm9hfkz","width":2000,"height":1125}],"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.laysofalthas.com\/"}]}
