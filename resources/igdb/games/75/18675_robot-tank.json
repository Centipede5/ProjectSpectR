Your job is to command a robot tank to stop them. Robot Tank is a first person perspective arcade style action game. There are twelve squadrons of tanks to destroy, each containing twelve tanks. Each time you destroy a complete squadron, you earn an extra reserve tank before moving on to the next, more difficult squadron. The game takes place twenty four hours a day; gameplay will alternate from early morning to mid afternoon to late at night. In addition to the constantly changing time of day, the weather can also change unexpectedly. Snow, rain, and fog will appear occasionally making it tougher to spot your targets. Luckily your tank is equipped with radar to help locate the enemy when visibility is poor. As your tank takes damage you will lose some capabilites, such as speed, the radar, or your canons. If your tank takes too much damage, it will be destroyed; the game ends when all of your reserve tanks are gone.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,10039,19341,68287,32902,68142,28751,51485,36950],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,536872733,536875358,536876718,1073741825],"developers":[66],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1821,4446,5806],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/odrspnsqzvvuu8g3fj5f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"odrspnsqzvvuu8g3fj5f","width":1000,"height":1352}}
