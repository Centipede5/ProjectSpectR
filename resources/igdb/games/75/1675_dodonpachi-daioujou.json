However, as time passed, the dormant machines reawakened, rebuilt, evolved: the underground caverns of the planet swarmed with all sorts of advanced warmachines, and automated production facilities, at their core a heavily guarded platform where the ultimate fighting machine of the past, the mechanical bee Hibachi (this time named \u7dcb\u8702, lit. \"scarlet bee\"), was slowly being rebuilt. Still following their original programming, the machines broke the seal, invading the surface and quickly seizing control of the almost defenseless Lunapolis, its streets and facilities now completely overtaken and littered with heavy artillery emplacements. \n \nWith little time to spare, the DonPachi Corps are reactivated, with enough time to build only two fighters; nevertheless, to each was bestowed the assistance of an Element Doll, highly evolved sentient droids (apparently widespread in human society by then, and treated as little more than slaves) capable of providing tactical data and enhancing the craft's own capabilities. Knowing that the mission is plausibly suicidal, the two attack ships are deployed on the Moon surface, just outside Lunapolis, alone against a ruthless army of machines with a single objective; killing.","collection":330,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55038,36950,68287,1676,109627,10209,1877,26202,17130,18954],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,536871015,536871078,536871756,536871823,536871882,536871904,536875056,536875083,536875158,536875198,536875201,536875245,536875258,536875870,536875879,536875904,536875934,536876296,536876878,536878104,536878192,536878199,536879840,1073741827],"developers":[2433],"publishers":[803,2517],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[103,166,844,911,970,992,4144,4171,4246,4286,4289,4333,4346,4958,4967,4992,5022,5384,5966,7192,7280,7287,8928],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":1019001600000,"platforms":[52,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1019001600000,"human":"2002-Apr-17","y":2002,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1049932800000,"human":"2003-Apr-10","y":2003,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u6012\u9996\u9818\u8702 \u5927\u5f80\u751f"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dcxoodgtquz3guazkaap.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dcxoodgtquz3guazkaap","width":850,"height":1168},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/DoDonPachi_DaiOuJou"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.arika.co.jp\/product\/daiojyo\/index.html"}]}
