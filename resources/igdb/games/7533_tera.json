Castanics, Elin, High Elves, Humans, and Poporis must band together to fend off a new enemy.\nA metallic race from the underworld called Argons; their goal is to take over Tera and wake the titans to end their dreams and destroy

is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game in which players battle monsters and complete quests in a fantasy world. Players can assume the role of humans, elves, giants, and other creatures as they join cooperative parties and \"level up\" their customizable characters. Players use swords, spears, and magical spells to kill enemies (e.g., ghosts, skeletons, zombies, giant animals) in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by cries of pain, slashing effects, and splashes of blood that stain the ground and players' screen. Several environments depict large pools of blood on the ground or covering torture devices. Some female characters wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and buttocks; their breasts occasionally bounce while running and jumping, and players have the ability to manipulate camera angles for zoomed-in views.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game has been rated PEGI 12 for depictions of non-realistic looking violence towards human-like characters, and containing mild bad language.
