With over 50 hours of gameplay and all-new content created to celebrate 20 years of the iconic Lara Croft. This is the most comprehensive version of the award-winning experience.

Lara must use her wits and survival skills, form new alliances, and ultimately embrace her destiny as the Tomb Raider. Experience high-octane action moments, conquer beautifully hostile environments, engage in brutal guerilla combat, and explore awe-inspiring deadly tombs in the evolution of survival action. In \u201cRise of the Tomb Raider,\u201d Lara becomes more than a survivor as she embarks on her first Tomb Raiding expedition. PlayStation VR Support: The full \u201cBlood Ties\u201d story chapter can be experienced in PlayStation VR, and players choose between two control schemes. \u201cComfort Mode\u201d allows players to teleport from point to point, completely eliminating any potential discomfort.
