But as we said,  you can\u2019t judge a book by its cover.\n\nIndeed, Nicky is far from being an ordinary boy. Through out both games in this pack, you will discover a Nicky eager to live adventures and to save the world from evil forces.\n\nIn the first opus, Nicky will be on his way to save his grand-father from the crual witch Zoldrane who locked him up in a really dark keep, to drag from this old man the secrets of his tribe.
