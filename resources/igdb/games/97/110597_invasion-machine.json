{"id":110597,"name":"Invasion Machine","slug":"invasion-machine","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/invasion-machine","created_at":1538851485379,"updated_at":1542348571661,"summary":"Invasion Machine is a modern warfare, counter-insurgency blend of a sandbox and RTS. Your goal is to command troops in an occupied province, in an effort of bringing back peace and order. Kill your enemies, help the civilian population, preserve the resources and the lives of your own soldiers.","storyline":"The Setting \nWhat led to our recent occupation of this land is still at the center of a heated political debate. \n \nWhat followed the invasion, was the worst scenario we may ever have imagined - we hoped we\u2019d be able to instill better leadership and let this country rebuild itself. But that\u2019s not what happened. Our toppling of the local government created a power vacuum in the area - which is now quickly leading to an unprecedented rise of new powers - the drug lords, locally known as Guerillas. If we don\u2019t stop this transformation, this entire country is gonna explode. We were not preparing for this, and it seems it\u2019s the last moment when we can still turn things around. \n \nYou, as the Commander of this Peace Force are tasked with restoring order and preparing ground for a new, legitimate government. \n \n \nThe Mission \nIf we\u2019re to ever leave this land, we must first win over the hearts and minds of the local population. The locals think we\u2019ve ruined their lives and frankly - most of them hates us. In order to win their trust - we must do our best to push out the criminal element, neutralize the remaining opposition and offer humanitarian help to them. \n \n \nThe Real Mission \nPoliticians run wars, and politicians only care about one thing - getting re-elected. In other words - your real job as the Commander is to make this war look good to the folks back home. Don\u2019t get your soldiers killed, don\u2019t lose too much equipment, and most importantly - don\u2019t let the press see anything that would contradict the official story. And the official story? It\u2019s obviously that we\u2019re winning. \n \n \nThe Campaign \nDivided into 8 chapters. The game takes you through the entire story of the invasion, starting right after the main battle of the war ends. At the beginning you are given just a handful of troops and old, derelict equipment. Unarmored, soft-shell transporters on the frontline? Check. Woodland camo in a desert country? Check. The army wasn\u2019t really prepared for a long invasion, and yours is just one of many missions in this conflict. So if you want better resources - you\u2019re gonna have to prove to your superiors that you\u2019re worth them. The campaign ends once you manage to secure your province and hold elections. When a new government can be trusted with taking the country over, we get to go home.","popularity":2.666666666666667,"games":[8422,78550,33603,18623,31515,25311,14758,21642,32283,29173],"tags":[39,268435469,268435471,268435480,268435488,536870913,536871033,536873126,536875171,536878303,536894188,1073741826],"developers":[16711],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,121,2214,4259,7391,23276],"themes":[39],"genres":[13,15,24,32],"first_release_date":1553990400000,"status":4,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":3,"platform":6,"date":1553990400000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Q1","y":2019,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5huc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5huc","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5hub.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5hub","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5hua.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5hua","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5hu9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5hu9","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5hu8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5hu8","width":1680,"height":1050}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"YpzkmvIq1OA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1h1o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1h1o","width":1680,"height":1028},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/964650"},{"category":15,"url":"https:\/\/pixelmachinegames.itch.io\/invasionmachine"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCA9gVK8ox42KtWhv0U9sISw"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/pixelmachine3d"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/invasionmachine.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"964650"}}
