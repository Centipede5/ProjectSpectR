The party had just found the Cosmic Forge, the pen that the Cosmic Lords use to script the events of the universe, after it was stolen by the Bane King and his Wizard, Xorphitus. Before the party could decide what to do with it, it was spirited away by a servant of the Cosmic Lords, the cyborg Aletheides. The Cosmic Forge was used to hide the location of the Astral Dominae, a powerful artifact with power over life itself, on planet Guardia. Because of this, its theft revealed Planet Guardia to the universe. Now, multiple forces are converging on Lost Guardia to find this artifact, including the party itself. It is after planetfall on Guardia that the story begins.","collection":211,"hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,11214,1593,76,6,36926,23198,1887,5082,1911],"tags":[268435468,536871059,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871504,536871609,536871938,536872283,536872978,536873384,536873473,536875042,536875265,536875304,536875314,536875331,536875336,536875337,536875372,536875455,536875464,536875531,536875738,536875791,536875855,536876007,536876010,536876286,536876376,536876706,536877422,536877423,536878391,536879783,536879998,536880444,536880549,536883234,536886724,1073741825],"developers":[273],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[147,226,227,296,592,697,1026,1371,2066,2472,2561,4130,4353,4392,4402,4419,4424,4425,4460,4543,4552,4619,4826,4879,4943,5095,5098,5374,5464,5794,6510,6511,7479,8871,9086,9532,9637,12322,15812],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Wizardry VII"},{"name":"Wizardry 7","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Wizardry VII: Crusaders of the Dark Savant"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r5ux6f8y6nzougkjl74e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r5ux6f8y6nzougkjl74e","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p55mfja3o3tk7ivmc1q6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p55mfja3o3tk7ivmc1q6","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tiogtab9eypdejr2a1oz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tiogtab9eypdejr2a1oz","width":320,"height":200}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"8RcLIQhSibA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ucqwsrgalga08c9iiwfp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ucqwsrgalga08c9iiwfp","width":648,"height":901},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizardry_VII:_Crusaders_of_the_Dark_Savant"}]}
