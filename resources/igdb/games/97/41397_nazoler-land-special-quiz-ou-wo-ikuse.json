Like the other Nazoler Land games, it was never released outside of Japan. \n \nNazoler Land Special: Quiz ou wo Ikuse (or \"Search for the Quiz Masters\") is a trivia game in which the player must answer trivia questions from eight different opponents across Japan in order to win the game. \n \nBecause the game was never released outside of Japan, it needs a considerable amount of Japanese knowledge to play, both to understand the questions and to be able to answer them. \n \nIt is not part of the core Nazoler Land series of games, which are all mini-game compilations.","collection":3369,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11588,25217,19083,51157,50724,43520,37487,6113,28213,27266],"tags":[268435465,268435482,536873513,536875051],"category":0,"keywords":[2601,4139],"genres":[9,26],"first_release_date":569462400000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":569462400000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-18","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p2kplrsncbmjnapqng4q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p2kplrsncbmjnapqng4q","width":340,"height":366}}
