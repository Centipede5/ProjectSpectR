The game is also known for its \"overwhelming cuteness\" and low level of difficulty. Although this may make the game seem geared towards a younger audience, in Japan, the game and series in general has seen much success.","storyline":"The game centers around the adventures of Cornet, a girl who can talk to puppets and has a magical horn that grants wishes, and Kururu, a puppet that has the heart and soul of a human. The majority of the game is about Cornet and Kururu trying to save Prince Ferdinand (whom Cornet is in love with) after he has been turned to stone by the self-proclaimed \"most beautiful witch in the world.\" The witch, Marjoly, also has a crush on the prince and had meant to put him to sleep, but messed up the spell and accidentally turned him to stone.","collection":2164,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":65,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":65,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[13196,5613,16468,75813,19698,36792,28010,26268,25311,26163],"tags":[17,268435468,268435471,268435480,1073741827],"developers":[1405],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,15,24],"first_release_date":913852800000,"platforms":[45,7,20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":913852800000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Dec-17","y":1998,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":913852800000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Dec-17","y":1998,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":954374400000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Mar-30","y":2000,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1166659200000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Dec-21","y":2006,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1217980800000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Aug-06","y":2008,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1222128000000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Sep-23","y":2008,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1238025600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Mar-26","y":2009,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The Puppet Princess of Marl Kingdom","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cnj4mi7rrx92bw9mjdze.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cnj4mi7rrx92bw9mjdze","width":256,"height":384}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q8s3tteegxpnzsp03ooo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q8s3tteegxpnzsp03ooo","width":256,"height":220},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/nippon1.jp\/consumer\/marlds\/index.html"}]}
