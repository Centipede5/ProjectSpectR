Ltd. The game is based on the Dragon Drive series and was only released in Japan. \n \nGameplay[edit] \nDragon Drive was an aerial combat game, set primarily in large, outdoor arenas where players had to face several waves of enemies. With multi-directional dash and lock on abilities, the game has sometimes drawn comparisons to the Zone of the Enders series. \n \nThe game also has a handful of rail shooter levels, drawing frequent comparisons to Sega's Panzer Dragoon series, but these comprise only a very small portion of the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,28029,142,64204,14364,27314,68279,10724,71455],"tags":[18,268435461,536870990,536871308,536871882,536871937,1073741826],"developers":[861],"publishers":[617],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[78,396,970,1025],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1048982400000,"platforms":[21],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1048982400000,"human":"2003-Mar-30","y":2003,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dljrkh1blc33zjwf5occ.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dljrkh1blc33zjwf5occ","width":256,"height":361}}
