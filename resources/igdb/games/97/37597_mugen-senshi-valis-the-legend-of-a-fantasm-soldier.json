You'd think she'd been duped - and you'd be right. The fiendish King Rogles stands poised to conquer the other worlds of the universe: the Dream World of Queen Valia, and the Human World. Rogles and his five Dark Lords have taken the force of Yang from Queen Valia and sealed it into a Fantasm Jewel. Only a warrior with a heart perfectly balanced between Yin and Yang can wield the Sword of Valis against the encroaching darkness! \n \nYuko, a young student from the Human World, is the chosen one - and you will control her. She is to become the greatest warrior in the universe, never suspecting that her most fearsome battle will not be against a Dark Lord, but against her closest friend from the Human World - the one she warned, \"Don't go out with him, he's the Dark...\" But before she could finish, her friend ran off into The Darkness.","collection":3238,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,10039,1188,37094,36608,74863,51485,26848,34919],"tags":[1,268435464,536871851,1073741828],"publishers":[827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"keywords":[939],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":700963200000,"platforms":[150],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":150,"date":700963200000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Mar-19","y":1992,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f1xndehvl9vdofrba6a8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f1xndehvl9vdofrba6a8","width":1424,"height":1414}}
