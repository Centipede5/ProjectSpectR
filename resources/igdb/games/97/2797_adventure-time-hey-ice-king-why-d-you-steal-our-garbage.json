Why'd you steal our garbage?! is the first video game based on the radical, Emmy nominated Cartoon Network show about two close friends - Jake, a wise old dog with a big kind heart, and Finn, a silly kid who wants more than anything else to become a great hero. Players will explore the Land of Ooo and set out on heroic quests, as their favorite characters Finn and Jake, in a unique action adventure experience. Adventure Time show creator Pendleton Ward is also heavily involved with the game creation, including the design of a brand new storyline, concept, and quests. \n \nFinn and Jake wake up one morning to find their trash stolen by the Ice King! Jake couldn't care less about half-eaten bananas, crumpled up math notes, and old chicken diapers - but when the Ice King uses these stolen goods to construct a Garbage Princess, our heroes embark on a fantastical adventure and teach him a lesson! Journey through the Land of Ooo in an offbeat adventure and discover perilous dungeons, unimaginable treasures, the true meaning of friendship, and never-ending fun!","collection":1516,"franchise":103,"franchises":[103],"rating":75,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":75.25,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":75.125,"total_rating_count":8,"rating_count":4,"games":[37419,78632,29032,81249,90109,80916,102178,106987,31712,87622],"tags":[1,268435487,536871075,1073741828],"developers":[1021],"publishers":[449],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[163],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1353369600000,"platforms":[20,37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1353369600000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Nov-20","y":2012,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1353369600000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Nov-20","y":2012,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1353369600000,"human":"2012-Nov-20","y":2012,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1353369600000,"human":"2012-Nov-20","y":2012,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fwnk3cs6i4gb9ku2uxxp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fwnk3cs6i4gb9ku2uxxp","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dxmz60ejygmi8djenzg5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dxmz60ejygmi8djenzg5","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xqal2tamyevkz76ojkha.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xqal2tamyevkz76ojkha","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bptukrjpltqreqmdw9oa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bptukrjpltqreqmdw9oa","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xxjsz4sngqgl4wn2vk36.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xxjsz4sngqgl4wn2vk36","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ymbvfqyb1v3u2bvozwfu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ymbvfqyb1v3u2bvozwfu","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tszs6yotadlggayuyh2p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tszs6yotadlggayuyh2p","width":400,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/amgrsckvzkfa7hmbeumr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"amgrsckvzkfa7hmbeumr","width":1591,"height":897},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ijctkd3r1didviewn64t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ijctkd3r1didviewn64t","width":1599,"height":899},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mqamoisivtws7uuvluaa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mqamoisivtws7uuvluaa","width":1599,"height":899},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ba1lio1m1ljixbr9df94.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ba1lio1m1ljixbr9df94","width":1593,"height":895},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xltymshmfyvpwu27avlc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xltymshmfyvpwu27avlc","width":1599,"height":899}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"0AGU2GtkYzA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pibquwjnlhwtdjtxf9cw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pibquwjnlhwtdjtxf9cw","width":250,"height":270},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action-adventure game based on characters from the TV show Adventure Time.

Players use punches and sword swipes to defeat \u201ccartoony\u201d enemies and boss creatures (e.g., penguins, turtles, rock monsters, a chainsaw-wielding bear).
