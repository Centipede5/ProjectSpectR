After surviving a few rounds, you'll go into an 'underground' cave where you fly through a treacherous corridor and attempt to dock with a refueling station (I'd guess.) After that, it's back to blasting targets again. Lather, rinse, repeat.","popularity":1,"games":[80210,76835,79068,67542,67483,67467,60924,79196,79195,76836],"tags":[268435461,268435486,536871846,536875410,536875411,536875412,536875656],"category":0,"keywords":[934,4498,4499,4500,4744],"genres":[5,30],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rhlhdm1mhgdr5j39sceo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rhlhdm1mhgdr5j39sceo","width":879,"height":1141}}
