The ball can rebound off these at unusual angles, making the outcomes of shots harder to predict. The basic objective is to pot all the balls, while failing to pot a ball in 3 shots will lose you the frame unless your opponent also fails to do this. \n \nThe game can be played by one or two players, with the one-player game consisting of a sequence of 20 different table layouts, each requiring its own style to win. Two-player games can take place on any of these layouts or one of your own design using the inbult table editor. Shot direction, speed and spin can be set on a general level.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,15851,36608,34919,55715,14713,80292,78813,78041,78015],"tags":[1,268435470,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[1166],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hujlpatsxtfvcmasnc39.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hujlpatsxtfvcmasnc39","width":256,"height":192}}
