He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning \"Monmotaro\" (not to be confused with \"Momotar\u014d\"), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage.","popularity":3.333333333333333,"games":[1070,94873,1073,5411,103316,10039,26820,29032,31579,4097],"tags":[268435464,536872225,536872939,1073741828],"developers":[263],"publishers":[263],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"keywords":[1313,2027],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":544233600000,"platforms":[52,86,41,5,18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1171929600000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Feb-20","y":2007,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":571017600000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Feb-05","y":1988,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1424822400000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Feb-25","y":2015,"m":2},{"category":1,"platform":52,"date":544233600000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Apr","y":1987,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":585705600000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Jul-24","y":1988,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ykgsggfqcs3gh6lwc0n1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ykgsggfqcs3gh6lwc0n1","width":1214,"height":850}}
