It is considered by many to be the watered-down version of Kick Off 2, previously released for the Commodore Amiga (and ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and Commodore 64). Kick Off 2 was originally programmed by Dino Dini for Anco Games, with the console adaptions being handled by Tiertex. \n \nFrom a franchise perspective, Super Kick Off would be followed by the controversial Kick Off 3: European Challenge. However, Dino Dini, who had no involvement in Kick Off 3 would go on to form his own company and produce the Amiga\/IBM PC game Goal!, which shares similar gameplay. Goal! also arrived on the Mega Drive, in the updated form of Dino Dini's Soccer.","collection":1943,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[18681,28862,10121,27081,79250,54662,18938,40808,15241,15851],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536875175,536875433,536875749],"category":0,"keywords":[26,4263,4521,4837],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[35],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/raxjqdhitrk7lnlgrnid.jpg","cloudinary_id":"raxjqdhitrk7lnlgrnid","width":1530,"height":1370}}
