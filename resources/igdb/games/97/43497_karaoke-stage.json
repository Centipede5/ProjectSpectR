The Original Concept for Karaoke Revolution was created by Scott Hawkins and Sneaky Rabbit Studios.[1] Technology and concepts from the game were subsequently incorporated into Harmonix's game Rock Band. \n \nThe Japanese versions of the game are developed by Konami themselves. The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments. \n \nThe game does not attempt to understand the singer's words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song. \n \nThe songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the SingStar series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos, where available. However, the 2009 remake of the game (titled Karaoke Revolution, just like the original) features all master tracks.[2]","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
