It was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 5, October 7 and October 8, 2010 in North America, Australia, Japan and Europe respectively.[1][2] A premium version, featuring all DLC content, was made for Microsoft Windows and Sony Playstation 3 and was later released on October 25, 2013.\n\nThe story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. Like the original story however, the plot revolves around someone who forces the help and protection of a warrior, with many characters sharing the same names and roles. The game's story was written by Alex Garland, with voice talent and motion capture from Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.","rating":80.9109092949594,"popularity":6.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":82.4444444444444,"aggregated_rating_count":13,"total_rating":81.6776768697019,"total_rating_count":98,"rating_count":85,"games":[80916,28309,25300,24426,55038,28168,62151,56033,36950,35371],"tags":[1,18,268435464,268435487,536870979,536870981,536871115,536871208,536871298,536871377,536871379,536871809,536871835,536871882,536871937,536871939,536871945,536872242,536872313,536872441,536873049,536873143,536875081,536875521,536875593,536875868,536878561,536880195,1073741826],"developers":[795],"publishers":[248],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[67,69,203,296,386,465,467,897,923,970,1025,1027,1033,1330,1401,1529,2137,2231,4169,4609,4681,4956,7649,9283],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8,31],"dlcs":[17468],"first_release_date":1286236800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[45,6,36,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1382486400000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Oct-23","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1382400000000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Oct-22","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1286496000000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Oct-08","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1286409600000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1286236800000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Oct-05","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1286236800000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Oct-05","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1382659200000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Oct-25","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1286409600000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1286409600000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1286409600000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1286496000000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Oct-08","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1286409600000,"region":7,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1286409600000,"region":7,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":36,"date":1317427200000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Oct-01","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":36,"date":1324339200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Dec-20","y":2011,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West -

Set in the post-apocalyptic future, the game allows players to engage in hand-to-hand combat with an assortment of mechanical robots and 'battle droids.' Players use turret guns and electrical blasts from a staff to defeat the enemies. Finishing 'takedowns' can be performed on weakened robots, resulting in up-close views of impaling and strike attacks. Some cutscenes depict red puffs of blood when characters are struck; small pools of blood also appear in a tower environment. Some cutscenes contain suggestive dialogue (e.g., 'It's just your hand is . . . right on my . . . Penis,' 'This machine is more incredible than my wettest dreams!'and 'I really get off on it. I mean really get off on it . . .'). The word 'sh*t' can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/enslaved.wikia.com\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Enslaved:_Odyssey_to_the_West"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/enslaved.namco.com\/"}]}
