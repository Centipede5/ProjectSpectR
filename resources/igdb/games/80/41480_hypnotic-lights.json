VP of Applications Software Gabriel Baum liked the effect, dubbed Hypnotic Lights, and asked programmer Steve Roney (Space Spartans) to work it into a game. \n \nSteve's reaction was pretty much: yeah, right, what game? Marketing had a suggestion: something sort of kind of like a Rubik's Cube. That's what Steve sort of kind of gave them. But while Steve continued to tinker with it when not working on higher priority games (including B-17 Bomber, Aquarius Utopia and Space Shuttle), Hypnotic Lights was never elevated to \"official\" status.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":886291200000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":886291200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kc3p9covk8uc5rro0bkx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kc3p9covk8uc5rro0bkx","width":988,"height":1316}}
