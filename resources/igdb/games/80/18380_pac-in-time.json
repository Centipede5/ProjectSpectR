Guess his stomach is full, 'cause there's nothing much to eat here, only collecting points. This is much like some Indiana Jones adventure, only your little hero's Pac-Man instead of Harrison Ford. \n \nPac-in-time is the US release of Fury of the Furries. It's exactly the same game. Only the characters were changed: the not-so-known European Tinies (from the Skweek\/Super Skweek\/Tiny Skweeks\/Brainies\/Tinies games) were replaced by the widely known Pac-Man.","collection":2095,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,20110,47211,103053,89495,63138,51942,51247,51203],"tags":[268435464,1073741828],"developers":[9421],"publishers":[263],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,4],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":786758400000,"platforms":[19,33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":786758400000,"region":1,"human":"1994-Dec-07","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":789091200000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Jan-03","y":1995,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":789091200000,"region":2,"human":"1995-Jan-03","y":1995,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":789091200000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Jan-03","y":1995,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":791769600000,"region":2,"human":"1995-Feb-03","y":1995,"m":2},{"category":2,"platform":33,"date":820368000000,"region":1,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30d1\u30c3\u30af\u30a4\u30f3\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iahxpggk6wchxmrl6sgt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iahxpggk6wchxmrl6sgt","width":252,"height":175}}
