Don't let them hit as they make the wall weaker. This sounds simplistic and is, but highly addictive as you score points for every alien destroyed. If a segment of the outer wall is destroyed (by the aliens kamikaze into it) if this happens enough times the outer wall flashes and you need to move in a level, post haste. If you don't, you drift off to space and all is lost. Don't fret though you have a chance to regain lost wall space by simply staying alive. If you stay alive long enough with no more incidents, you can regain that which has been lost...precious wall.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,142,27314,71455,25300,27523,11253],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870915,536871882,536871937,536875258],"category":0,"keywords":[3,970,1025,4346],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yklgcksk0fucrayq01gm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yklgcksk0fucrayq01gm","width":500,"height":375}}
