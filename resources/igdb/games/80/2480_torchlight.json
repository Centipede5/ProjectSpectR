Presented from a 3\/4 overhead perspective, the game allows players to increase their fame, skills, and gold, while collecting weapons, armor, spells, and health potions along the way. Players encounter fantastical creatures (giant spiders, lizard miners, mutant creatures, etc.) that must be killed to proceed. Players use hatchets, sabers, maces, spears, or magic to strike at the creatures. Bright red blood particles emit from injured creatures, stick to the floor, then disappear within a few seconds; the particles are somewhat \"splotchy\" and unrealistic-looking, though they appear with some frequency.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Torchlight"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.torchlightgame.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/41500"}],"external":{"steam":"41500"}}
