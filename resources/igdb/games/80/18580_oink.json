{"id":18580,"name":"Oink!","slug":"oink","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/oink","created_at":1459506666524,"updated_at":1517270912359,"summary":"Oink! is based on the fairy tale of the three little pigs. The big bad wolf is trying to blow down each of the pigs houses. You control each pig one at a time. The wolf is at the bottom of the screen and will blow a hole in the house one section at a time. Each time a hole is formed, the pig must patch it up quickly so the wolf can't get in. New materials are located at the top of the screen, and you need to grab them and place them in the holes as they are formed. The longer you last, the tougher the wolf will become! You start the game controlling the pig whose house is made of straw; when he is caught, you move on to the pig in the house made of sticks. Finally you will control the pig in the house made of bricks. When all three pigs have been caught by the wolf, the game is over.","collection":3792,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25300,27314,19448,1936,2558,36950,80074,11567,26766,25311],"tags":[1,18,268435487,268435489,536870926,536870990,536871006,536871076,536871186,536871882,536871939,536871945,536872328,536872617,536873299,536874834,536875053,536875074,536875088,536875153,536875159,536875222,536875243,536875833,536876391,536877001,536877764,536878067,536878085,536880072,536880262,1073741826],"developers":[66],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[14,78,94,164,274,970,1027,1033,1416,1705,2387,3922,4141,4162,4176,4241,4247,4310,4331,4921,5479,6089,6852,7155,7173,9160,9350],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[31,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tgyrf7xftjzu3mtgp50u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tgyrf7xftjzu3mtgp50u","width":992,"height":1383}}
