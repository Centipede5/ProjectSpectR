Its name means \"Railroad Baron\". It was only released in Japan, for the Famicom, and has two sequels. \n \nTetsudou-Oh (occasionally with the subtitle \"Famicom Boardgame\") is a competitive railroad tycoon-type game where the goal is to own a lot of railroad stations and make a lot of money while bankrupting the other players. Tetsudou-Oh also borrows elements from the Game of Life board game, specifically the lucky\/unlucky event that follows every turn and can completely reverse a player's fortunes. \n \nTetsudou-Oh would be followed by Tetsudou-Oh '96 and Tetsudou-Oh 2, both for the Sony PlayStation. The original game would also see a mobile phone platform remake, named Tetsudou-Oh NEO.","collection":3681,"popularity":1,"games":[11588,19083,28213,25217,19082,37824,7782,48771,37823,16439],"tags":[268435471,268435482,536872273,536873513,536875051,536875058,536880423],"category":0,"keywords":[1361,2601,4139,4146,9511],"genres":[15,26],"first_release_date":568944000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":568944000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-12","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r660l4124oasw2tjh9yr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r660l4124oasw2tjh9yr","width":300,"height":209}}
