Later enemies also have projectile weapons that the player must dodge.[4] They are defeated by throwing a found object at them or hitting them with an always-equipped pipe. Jumping on the enemies' heads will push them down a level or off the screen entirely. Levels feature either boss battles or a pile of gold bars at the end, worth various points depending on the level.","collection":2448,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,10039,1070,19174,51485,49598,26848,1073,36868,34919],"tags":[1,268435464,536870973,536871306,536872961,536873370,536875286,536885037],"category":0,"keywords":[61,394,2049,2458,4374,14125],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Arcade Archives: Mr. Goemon","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ahtb9l5vcjw9wssmcgxc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ahtb9l5vcjw9wssmcgxc","width":240,"height":224}}
