{"id":80,"name":"The Witcher","slug":"the-witcher","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/the-witcher","created_at":1298020925000,"updated_at":1547445944921,"summary":"Being based on a novel series by Andrzej Sapkowski \u2013 a bestselling Polish author \u2013 gives the game\u2019s universe and characters credibility, authority and exceptional cohesiveness. In this harsh fantasy world abstract, absolute and unconditional ideas such as \u201cGood\u201d and \u201cEvil\u201d written in upper case letters do not exist. Instead, however, while moral good exists , the protagonist will often only have a choice between two evils, deciding on the path which he regards as the lesser evil of the two. The game also features an innovative, time delayed decision-consequence system, prodding players to make their decisions seriously and with thought.","storyline":"The game begins when Geralt of Rivia, one of a few remaining \"witchers\" \u2013 traveling monster hunters for hire, gifted with unnatural powers, is transported to the witcher stronghold of Kaer Morhen by fellow witchers who had discovered him unconscious in a field. Geralt remembers almost nothing of his life before that point. He is taken to Kaer Morhen, the base of the witchers, where he meets a sorceress named Triss Merigold. The castle is attacked by a gang of bandits named Salamandra, led by a criminal known as the Professor, a mage named Savolla who controls a large, praying mantis-like monster, and another mage named Azar Javed. The witchers and the sorceress manage to slay the monster and kill Savolla, but the Professor and Azar manage to escape with the mutagens that genetically alter the witchers. After curing Triss of the wounds she received while fighting Javed, Geralt and the rest of the witchers head off in different directions in order to find information on Salamandra.","collection":62,"franchise":452,"franchises":[452],"rating":83.1109517412905,"popularity":10.66666666666667,"aggregated_rating":88,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":85.55547587064525,"total_rating_count":244,"rating_count":240,"games":[1942,478,1887,76,44,3025,472,6,7208,23941],"tags":[1,17,268435468,536871041,536871059,536871123,536871134,536871138,536871139,536871186,536871208,536871213,536871422,536871449,536871504,536871641,536871758,536871938,536871945,536872070,536872092,536872201,536872225,536872232,536872234,536872435,536872626,536872647,536872793,536872799,536872810,536872873,536872883,536872978,536873364,536873384,536873580,536873889,536873949,536873992,536874398,536874745,536875042,536875046,536875050,536875243,536875253,536875262,536875271,536875275,536875281,536875306,536875331,536875356,536875372,536875398,536875432,536875436,536875453,536875455,536875485,536875492,536875494,536875523,536875531,536875556,536875614,536875657,536875699,536875760,536875762,536875764,536875767,536875781,536875791,536875792,536875868,536875891,536875895,536875930,536875941,536875944,536875952,536876007,536876032,536876121,536876174,536876266,536876270,536876281,536876333,536876335,536876392,536876490,536876503,536876505,536876569,536876570,536876571,536876595,536876726,536876814,536876840,536876910,536877032,536877047,536877207,536877209,536877289,536877434,536877453,536877519,536877559,536877565,536877763,536877769,536877770,536877816,536877965,536878009,536878132,536878292,536878328,536878335,536878349,536878354,536878382,536878445,536878508,536878515,536879059,536879062,536879105,536879109,536879114,536879742,536879859,536879882,536879958,536880294,536880682,536880709,536880920,536881009,536881025,536881122,536881347,536881790,536882362,536882498,536883229,536883238,536883370,536883415,536883968,536883970,536883988,536883995,536884018,536884021,536884022,536885416,536885932,536886710,536886902,536886903,536886904,536886905,536886906,536886907,536886908,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[908],"publishers":[82,908],"game_engines":[68],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":214800,"completely":313200},"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[129,147,211,222,226,227,274,296,301,510,537,592,729,846,1026,1033,1158,1180,1289,1313,1320,1322,1523,1714,1735,1881,1887,1898,1961,1971,2066,2452,2472,2668,2977,3037,3080,3486,3833,4130,4134,4138,4331,4341,4350,4359,4363,4369,4394,4419,4444,4460,4486,4520,4524,4541,4543,4573,4580,4582,4611,4619,4644,4702,4745,4787,4848,4850,4852,4855,4869,4879,4880,4956,4979,4983,5018,5029,5032,5040,5095,5120,5209,5262,5354,5358,5369,5421,5423,5480,5578,5591,5593,5657,5658,5659,5683,5814,5902,5928,5998,6120,6135,6295,6297,6377,6522,6541,6607,6647,6653,6851,6857,6858,6904,7053,7097,7220,7380,7416,7423,7437,7442,7470,7533,7596,7603,8147,8150,8193,8197,8202,8830,8947,8970,9046,9382,9770,9797,10008,10097,10113,10210,10435,10878,11450,11586,12317,12326,12458,12503,13056,13058,13076,13083,13106,13109,13110,14504,15020,15798,15990,15991,15992,15993,15994,15995,15996],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1193356800000,"pulse_count":35,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1193356800000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Oct-26","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1193702400000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Oct-30","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1194566400000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Nov-09","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1207872000000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Apr-11","y":2008,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1333584000000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Apr-05","y":2012,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The

Witcher: Enhanced Edition: Director's Cut  is a role-playing action adventure game in which players assume the role of a warrior with magic abilities. The main character can fight his way through enemies, accept missions and quests, and obtain items and information from a wide variety of characters. Red blood and occasional dismemberment is depicted during gameplay and cutscenes. Characters use strong profanity (e.g. f*ck, c*nt, c*ck, sh*t) in spoken dialogue and on-screen text. Using a 'choose your own adventure' format, players can opt to have sex with female characters. These sex scenes depict blurry bodies and cards with still images of nude or semi-nude women in provocative poses.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/20900"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/WitcherGame"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/witchergame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/thewitcher"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Witcher_(video_game)"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/witcher.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Witcher_(computer_game)"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/thewitcher.com\/witcher1\/"}]}
