In the two player mode, both players fight each other until victory. The quicker and more efficiently each player clears out their screen, the quicker the other player's screen will fill up. Since filled screens offer the most opportunity for chaining together large combos, the tide can turn very quickly. \n \nThere is also another single player mode called Solo Mode. Any character can be played in this mode. The aim in Solo Mode is to continually clear the screen from coins and try to keep the game going for as long as possible.","popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":81,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":81,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[24426,20329,20342,55173,8197,56033,57372,25222,62890,60044],"tags":[1,268435465,268435489,536870990,536871198,536872308,536873787,536875122,536875130,536875244,536875261,536875281,536875284,536875356,536875364,536875379,536875761,536875870,536876266,536877277,536881098,1073741828],"developers":[10065],"publishers":[12963,5839,2582,12962],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[78,286,1396,2875,4210,4218,4332,4349,4369,4372,4444,4452,4467,4849,4958,5354,6365,10186],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,33],"first_release_date":853286400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[45,6,7,79,33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":853286400000,"region":2,"human":"1997-Jan-15","y":1997,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":853286400000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Jan-15","y":1997,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1289865600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1202860800000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Feb-13","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":910224000000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Nov-05","y":1998,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":890352000000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Mar-20","y":1998,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":872812800000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Aug-29","y":1997,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Money Idol Exchanger","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30de\u30cd\u30fc\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30c1\u30a7\u30f3\u30b8\u30e3\u30fc","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/osd8jjujkc2z31nkh1io.jpg","cloudinary_id":"osd8jjujkc2z31nkh1io","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tz5gz67gh56kax7zj6id.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tz5gz67gh56kax7zj6id","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kdb18kczpzzubzmz3mil.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kdb18kczpzzubzmz3mil","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gj4n8dggxbiewi5fgyk2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gj4n8dggxbiewi5fgyk2","width":304,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p3ropzj5gjio9rf6fdi1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p3ropzj5gjio9rf6fdi1","width":1000,"height":737}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"9YZhLRRH4c8"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"5YP1bWatwxs"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"3cmxFE69uyk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/utxsrcoh4yk32qgdotw4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"utxsrcoh4yk32qgdotw4","width":575,"height":820},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Money_Idol_Exchanger"}]}
