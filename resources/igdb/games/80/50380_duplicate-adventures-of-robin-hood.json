The player controls Robin as he robs from the rich to give to the poor, adventures through Sherwood Forest, defeats the sheriff's henchmen, gathers special objects and saves peasants. Heroic acts increase Robin's popularity among NPCs. Archery plays an important role in gameplay. \nThe isometric interface developed for The Adventures of Robin Hood by Millennium Interactive is similar to the interface used in Populous. Robin Hood's interface was later used for Rome: Pathway to Power. \n \nQuoted from Wikipedia","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[76397,47823,81249,78632,102873,78149,103501,25877,1221,80916],"tags":[33,268435468,268435487],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"themes":[17,33],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[6,13],"release_dates":[{"category":6,"platform":13,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991-Q4","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":917827200000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Feb-01","y":1999,"m":2}]}
