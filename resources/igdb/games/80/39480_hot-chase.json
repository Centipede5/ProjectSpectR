The car has a bomb attached to it that explodes in a set time. If the bomb explodes, players must restart. There are many obstacles along the way, including railroad crossings, military checkpoints, helicopters that shoot at the car and other cars. The gameplay is said to be similar to Chase HQ. \n \nCompleting the game resulted in a scene where the hero exits the car, takes his machine gun, and fires at the car to add to the damage before the bomb explodes. Then the game played the following message: \"Mission Complete. You have succeeded in stealing the enemy armored super car and have crossed the border to freedom. After a few days the enemy surrendered to our country. You will be remembered for your brave deeds. Thanks a million!\"","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[87728,101172,76253,103316,27701,103312,86041,15851,103301,27378],"tags":[1,268435466,268435489,1073741826],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kuwiu6qgxyeerzsvbg2a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kuwiu6qgxyeerzsvbg2a","width":1000,"height":1416}}
