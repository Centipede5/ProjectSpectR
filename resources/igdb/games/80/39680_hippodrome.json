Players choose one of two human fighters, who must overcome eight terrifying and monstrous fantastic opponents (eg. dragon, wizard, scorpion-man) in the ring to win a tournament and rule the kingdom for one year. Between bouts, players can visit a store and upgrade their equipment, granting them different health, range and damage bonuses. A second player can join in at any time to challenge the current player, but only the winner can proceed in the tournament. \n \nThis game is succeeded by Mutant Fighter.","collection":2957,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75962,46815,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704],"tags":[268435460,1073741828],"developers":[2678],"publishers":[2678],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":602294400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":602294400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Feb-01","y":1989,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Fighting Fantasy","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hf9ndhl9dyrpkdayhmkl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hf9ndhl9dyrpkdayhmkl","width":1410,"height":1000}}
