The object of the game is to make your pieces constitute a majority of the pieces on the board at the end of the game, by converting as many of your opponent's pieces as possible. \n \nEach player begins with two pieces, white and black, for the first player and second player respectively. The game starts with the four pieces on the four corners of the board, with white in the top left and bottom right and black on the other two. White moves first. \n \nDuring their turn, players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction. Diagonal distances are equivalent to orthogonal distances, e.g. it is legal to move to a square whose relative position is two squares away both vertically and horizontally. If the destination is adjacent to the source, a new piece is created on the empty departure square. Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination. After the move, all of the opponent player's pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the color of the moving player. Players must move unless no legal move is possible, in which case they must pass.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[56292,25222,60044,68287,71455,51978,14047,26766,36950,66739],"tags":[18,268435465,536871882,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[970,2875],"themes":[18],"genres":[9],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Infection"},{"name":"SlimeWars"},{"name":"Frog Cloning"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hssylhesopgfsyh14phx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hssylhesopgfsyh14phx","width":850,"height":1097}}
