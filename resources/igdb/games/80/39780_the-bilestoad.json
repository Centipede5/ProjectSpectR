The name is derived from the German words Beil (axe) and Tod (death). The odd spelling reflects Goodman's idea of a future language similar to A Clockwork Orange's Nadsat in which English has been modified by the borrowing of foreign words.[1] Although the game may seem medieval, the backstory in the manual explains that the axe fighting is actually a future virtual reality game designed to reduce real violence.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,71455,26766,142,36950,25300,64204,75089,56987,27314],"tags":[18,268435460,536871019,536871882],"category":0,"keywords":[107,970],"themes":[18],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":383875200000,"platforms":[75],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":75,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982-Dec-31","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":75,"date":383875200000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Mar-02","y":1982,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/potvpxjmuzgdr8boz5yd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"potvpxjmuzgdr8boz5yd","width":800,"height":1226}}
