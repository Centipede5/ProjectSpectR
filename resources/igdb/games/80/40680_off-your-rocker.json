A prototype game that was mass produced! It seems that Amiga sent these carts off to a company that handled the task of labeling them. During this time Amiga was in trouble and the games never got labeled or retrieved by Amiga. Years later they were sold off as scrap to a videogame dealer who added his own label and sold them to the classic community. Gameplay is similar to the handheld game, Simon.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,16468,17537,23175,74633,40524,74966,66047,61315],"tags":[1,268435463,536872407,536875049],"category":0,"keywords":[1495,4137],"themes":[1],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":423619200000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":423619200000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Jun-05","y":1983,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pkiwcmdjtbr0qhy65qor.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pkiwcmdjtbr0qhy65qor","width":400,"height":472}}
