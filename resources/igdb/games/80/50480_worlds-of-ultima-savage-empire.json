There, you must work towards uniting the native tribes to face a common threat: a race of gigantic ants known as the Myrmidex. You won\u2019t be alone, however, as you will be assisted by Professor Rafkin, ace reporter Jimmy Malone, and the exotic jungle princess Aiela. Take control of strange and powerful shamanistic magics and confront a varied bestiary that includes vicious dinosaurs and even mad high priests. \n \nWorlds of Ultima 1: Savage Empire was built using a modified Ultima VI engine; it\u2019s familiar to long-time fans but it\u2019s also a great starting point for people who are new to the world of Ultima. Featuring a text-based conversation system along with turn-based combat, Worlds of Ultima 1: Savage Empire should find a permanent space on your hard drive.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[12]}
