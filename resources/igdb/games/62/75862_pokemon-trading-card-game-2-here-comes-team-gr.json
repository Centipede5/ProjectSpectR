The game story revolves around a new villainous team, Team Great Rocket, and contains nearly all of the cards from Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, and Team Rocket. A promotional Lugia card was included with the game. \n \nThe game adds many new features not present in the original, such as new cards, the ability to play as a female character, a much larger in-game world, and a more developed story (rather than just collect cards and defeat the Grand Masters, the player must defeat Team Great Rocket).","collection":1569,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[864],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[12,16],"first_release_date":985737600000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":985737600000,"region":5,"human":"2001-Mar-28","y":2001,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pok\u00e9mon Card GB2: Here Comes Team GR!","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Pok\u00e9mon Card GB 2: GR-dan Sanjou!
