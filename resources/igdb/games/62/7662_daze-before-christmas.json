According to the game's Christmas calender, you have 24 areas to explore such as factories, workshops, caves, and more. Each area is filled with nasty enemies like penguins, jack-in-the-boxes, helicopters, snowmen, and many others. Furthermore, after every five areas, Santa has to come face-to-face with not only The Evil Snowman, The Timekeeper, and Louse the Mouse, but also Mr. Weather.","storyline":"Christmas is a time where people get together and give others presents and spend all day eating food. But there's only one problem this year. You see, while Santa was sleeping in his bed, the cold and evil snowman spooked all the elves away, and the Timekeeper has stolen Santa's plans from his house. There won't be any Christmas if Santa doesn't stop them.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,36868,26848,10039,37137,19174,21063,26761,117,6705],"tags":[1,27,268435464,536871744,536871931,536872140,536872622,536872961,536874139,536874209,536875073,536875102,536875155,536875232,536875262,536875362,536875826,536876069,536876237,536876352,536876357,536876361,536877563,536880159,1073741828],"developers":[458],"publishers":[251],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[832,1019,1228,1710,2049,3227,3297,4161,4190,4243,4320,4350,4450,4914,5157,5325,5440,5445,5449,6651,9247],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[29,19],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":19,"date":788832000000,"region":1,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":788832000000,"region":1,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xppfgipekui6ijbeqajn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xppfgipekui6ijbeqajn","width":550,"height":353}}
