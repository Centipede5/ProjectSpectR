An intercourse simulator and part of K\u014dei's Strawberry Porno series, Night Life is considered to be a precursor for the  Bish\u014djo game genre. \n\nIn-game, the player has a limited set of options, including determining the date of a woman's period, a choice of sex positions and the option of how much time to allocate to each one. The intercourse is then displayed on the screen through the 'Let's Fuck' option, and is non-interactive.","collection":1768,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"games":[22425,19785,22422,22423,22470,29730,41895,22469,19808,22471],"tags":[42,268435469,268435487,536871186,536871255,536871270,536871446,536871758,536871759,536871939,536872060,536872114,536872617,536872626,536872873,536872903,536872957,536873516,536875240,536875281,536876211,536879588],"developers":[630],"publishers":[630],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[274,343,358,534,846,847,1027,1148,1202,1705,1714,1961,1991,2045,2604,4328,4369,5299,8676],"themes":[42],"genres":[13,31],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[125],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":125,"date":410140800000,"region":5,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h8kgkfhxlchjvkcecp1g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h8kgkfhxlchjvkcecp1g","width":332,"height":210},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Night_Life_(video_game)"}]}
