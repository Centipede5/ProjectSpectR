The player plays as Io, an ordinary boy with a tender heart, whom village elders force to \"go on a journey\" to save the world from disaster. The game is a dungeon crawl game where the player is required to navigate through maps containing enemies. Battles are turn-based, and involve attacking parts of enemy monster girls so that their clothes fall off; eventually at the end of the battle, the player is required to rub the monster girl using the front and rear touchpads of the PlayStation Vita.","collection":1542,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[16468,12632,13196,36534,19698,36792,26915,26163,28010,5613],"tags":[17,268435468,536871327,536871433,536872121,1073741829,1073741826],"developers":[2252],"publishers":[13634,2252],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[415,521,1209],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1400112000000,"platforms":[46],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1400112000000,"region":5,"human":"2014-May-15","y":2014,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1430784000000,"region":7,"human":"2015-May-05","y":2015,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u9650\u754c\u51f8\u8a18 \u30e2\u30a8\u30ed\u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vehkshbzdhoeccnqmyxi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vehkshbzdhoeccnqmyxi","width":1173,"height":1500},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.compileheart.com\/moe-chro\/"}]}
