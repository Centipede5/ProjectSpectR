{"id":50462,"name":"Extreme Pinball","slug":"extreme-pinball","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/extreme-pinball","created_at":1500041638801,"updated_at":1500461743266,"summary":"Extreme Pinball is Epic Megagames' successor to Epic Pinball. It contains four pinball tables: Rock Fantasy, Medieval Knights, Urban Chaos, and Monkey Mayhem, each with a different theme. Compared to Epic Pinball, it has a larger, 320x400 resolution, as well as taller tables, both allowing for more objects. It also has a typical Dot Matrix Display where the scoreboard shows 3D-rendered animations as well. The controls are more sensitive with a faster ball. This is less true to real pinball gameplay, but it speeds up the game's pace and gives more power to the player to influence the movement.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}]}
