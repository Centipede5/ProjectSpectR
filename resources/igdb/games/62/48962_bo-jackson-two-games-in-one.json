In baseball, you can participate in all the major parts of the ballgame, such as pitching, hitting, and fielding. The field is displayed in 3D using an engine called \"3-D Sensation.\" In football, the field is displayed as an overhead view in 2D with tiny players running around -- a sharp contrast to the graphic style of the baseball portion of the game. The football game allows you to design your own plays and watch them with instant replay.","collection":5044,"popularity":1,"games":[18681,54662,15851,42559,57738,701,28862,71661,15041,14713],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536870938,536870939,536875139,536875151,536875186,536875570,536877686],"category":0,"keywords":[20,26,27,4227,4239,4274,4658,6774],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":678326400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":678326400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Jul-01","y":1991,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Bo Jackson's Hit and Run!
