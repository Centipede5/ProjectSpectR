Now Theo, who may be a dab hand in the waving of wands area, is not much cop at the filing-things-away-neatly department, and he's left his Book of Really Powerful Spells lying round in his laboratory. What's more, the book's been left open at the page headed A Really, Really, Powerful Spell (That Shouldn't Be Read Out Loud). Whether Dizzy actually read the heading is not known but - yikes! - he said the spell and it's caused a catastrophe- Dizzy's spirited all his Yolk Folk chums and Wizard Theo into the underworld! Cripes! There's only one course of action open to the brave little hero- read the spell again and spirit himself into the underworld to save his rotund group of pals!","collection":1594,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,51485,28154,47823,26766,12049,36926,27367,19289,26223],"tags":[268435464,268435487,268435489,536871208,536872961,536873030,536876120,536879691,536886686,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,2049,2118,5208,8779,15774],"genres":[8,31,33],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[16,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ncrcn0nxt2j5qpzby2ew.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ncrcn0nxt2j5qpzby2ew","width":650,"height":640}}
