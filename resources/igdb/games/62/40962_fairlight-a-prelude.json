The former ruler's castle Avars is shrouded in mystery, and Isvar chooses to investigate it. Unfortunately, he finds himself trapped in a mysterious castle from which he must escape. \n \nViewed isometrically, Isvar's adventure features complex object manipulation: each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. The castle is guarded and full of trolls, who can weaken Isvar's energy - food and wine can restore it.\" --mobygames.com","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[72412,55289,59516,49414,76122,36792,23719,25636,74378,25311],"tags":[268435468,268435487],"category":0,"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":507600000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":507600000000,"region":8,"human":"1986-Feb-01","y":1986,"m":2}]}
