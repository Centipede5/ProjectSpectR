For example, in the Scotland style Cadence to Arms, a familiar bagpipes tune, is used. \n \nMost backing tracks loop around one or two chords, allowing an open improvisation on the main keyboard. Once the style is chosen, the main keyboard is masked in the way that only the scale that easily fits into the style is available, e.g. blues scale, pentatonic scale, etc. \n \nThe keyboard is controlled by the UP-DOWN or LEFT-RIGHT d-pads on the game controller so there is no way to play leaps in the scale. \n \nDue to the hardware limitation, the sound produced is the typical 8-bit chiptune music.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[79715,64194,50109,37067,66438,61286,28192,11711,64362,34218],"tags":[34,268435463,536871446,536871814,536873878,536875049,536876199,536878239],"category":0,"keywords":[534,902,2966,4137,5287,7327],"themes":[34],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":541900800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":541900800000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Mar-05","y":1987,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":544579200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Apr-05","y":1987,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vlj7ipmjgycfnfng8azo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlj7ipmjgycfnfng8azo","width":288,"height":417}}
