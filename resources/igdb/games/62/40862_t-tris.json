Bastian Schick, \nan ambitious gamer from Germany, decides to write and sell his own video \ngame without benefit of any kind of corporate sponsorship. His effort is \nT-TRIS, a version of Tetris for the Atari Lynx. If you've been living in a \ncave for the last ten years, Tetris is a game where oddly-shaped blocks \nfall from the top of the screen as the player rotates and positions them. \nSolid rows of blocks vanish to make room for more, and the pieces fall \nfaster as time progresses.
