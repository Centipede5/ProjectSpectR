The strong Tasuke and the cute Kyapiko (aka Arnold and Sonya in the American version) are back in this intense side scrolling action game. This time around, our heroes have swapped their power-swords for more conventional laser guns. The guns can also be charged up (by holding the fire button) to unleash powerful blasts of energy. Another interesting feature of the game is the alternance of platform and shooting stages. For instance, right after the first level and the crazy chase jumping from building tops to building tops, our heroes embark on a pocket-submarine and get their way through a treacherous underwater cave. A two simultaneous player mode is available and, interestingly, both players share the same life bar.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":675302400000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":675302400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-May-27","y":1991,"m":5}]}
