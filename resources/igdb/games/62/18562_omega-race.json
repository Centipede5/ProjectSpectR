The player's ship is controlled with a spinner to rotate the ship, a button for thrusting, and a button for firing lasers. The enemies that the player must destroy or avoid are drone ships, commander ships, two types of space mines, and shooting star ships. The ship bounces off an invisible barrier on the edges of the screen that briefly appears when hit. By default, Extra ships are awarded at 40,000 and 100,000 points, but this can be changed by the machine's owner.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,36950,64204,27314,10039,25311,76246,76229,19341],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536873246,536881123,536881271,1073741827],"developers":[566,1436],"publishers":[566,6427,2426],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[2334,10211,10359],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[71,68,52,59,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":71,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gewgodoqotj9wcz2gjpi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gewgodoqotj9wcz2gjpi","width":1000,"height":1381}}
