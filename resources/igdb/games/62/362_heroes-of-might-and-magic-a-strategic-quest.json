A spin-off of New World Computing's Might and Magic series of role-playing video games, the success of Heroes of Might and Magic led to a number of sequels.\r\nIn 1996, NWC released an updated version of the game, ported to Windows 95. This new version included a map editor, random map generator, CD audio, and new scenarios. As a bonus, King's Bounty was also included on the CD.","storyline":"Heroes of Might and Magic tells the story of Lord Morglin Ironfist, who is forced to flee his homeland through a magical portal, because his cousin, Ragnar, had usurped the throne after his uncle, Ragnar's father, killed Ironfist's father, the legitimate owner of the throne.\r\n\r\nHe finds himself along with his few followers in a strange and uncharted land, called Enroth. The land is unruled but contested by Ironfist and three other warlords: the barbarian Lord Slayer, the sorceress Queen Lamanda, and the warlock Lord Alamar.\r\n\r\nIn the canonical storyline, Lord Ironfist defeats his three opponents and founds a new kingdom in Enroth. It is possible for the player to lead the other factions to victory, however this is not reflected in the following games of the Heroes of Might and Magic series.","collection":194,"franchise":458,"franchises":[458],"rating":79.941184411568,"popularity":4.666666666666666,"aggregated_rating":75,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":77.470592205784,"total_rating_count":17,"rating_count":16,"games":[5652,364,363,255,14394,3126,6,373,1223,5550],"tags":[17,268435468,268435471,268435472,536871123,536871138,536871139,536871172,536871208,536871213,536871327,536871390,536871409,536871865,536871938,536872074,536872098,536872291,536872352,536872449,536872471,536872622,536872898,536873064,536873311,536873364,536873822,536874345,536874694,536874743,536874745,536874830,536874834,536875042,536875095,536875130,536875160,536875214,536875232,536875304,536875307,536875314,536875361,536875419,536875455,536875488,536875523,536875531,536875537,536875639,536875679,536875699,536875775,536875778,536875791,536875792,536875855,536875870,536875901,536875941,536875956,536876057,536876083,536876281,536876282,536876285,536876348,536876413,536876590,536876606,536876706,536876847,536876986,536877211,536877432,536877453,536877568,536878073,536878338,536878442,536879058,536879217,536880645,536880745,536880854,536881181,536881452,536882130,536882496,1073741828,1073741827],"developers":[97],"publishers":[97,99],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[211,226,227,260,296,301,415,478,497,953,1026,1162,1186,1379,1440,1537,1559,1710,1986,2152,2399,2452,2910,3433,3782,3831,3833,3918,3922,4130,4183,4218,4248,4302,4320,4392,4395,4402,4449,4507,4543,4576,4611,4619,4625,4727,4767,4787,4863,4866,4879,4880,4943,4958,4989,5029,5044,5145,5171,5369,5370,5373,5436,5501,5678,5694,5794,5935,6074,6299,6520,6541,6656,7161,7426,7530,8146,8305,9733,9833,9942,10269,10540,11218,11584],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,15,16],"first_release_date":809827200000,"platforms":[6,14,13],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":809827200000,"human":"1995-Aug-31","y":1995,"m":8},{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":823132800000,"human":"1996-Feb","y":1996,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":841795200000,"human":"1996-Sep-04","y":1996,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Heroes of Might and Magic 1","comment":"Other"},{"name":"HOMM","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hv53l1jhog8dxpxtqdaz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hv53l1jhog8dxpxtqdaz","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qppjtbglnsdaaxbl2q5f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qppjtbglnsdaaxbl2q5f","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jxs0kxzpfsz01lwonqj3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jxs0kxzpfsz01lwonqj3","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uyh8hsywdnskbokqj4by.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uyh8hsywdnskbokqj4by","width":642,"height":482},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wrsvsnryqtzmfbqugnzj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wrsvsnryqtzmfbqugnzj","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"cowyllTqkV0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fapnik2j9lvladuzkbwh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fapnik2j9lvladuzkbwh","width":650,"height":650},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic"}]}
