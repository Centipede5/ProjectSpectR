The spies fought by means of throwing snowballs at each other and setting traps, which decreased their body heat bar. Tools the spies used included a saw which allowed a hole to be cut in the ice for the second player to fall into and lose body heat. Lost body heat could be restored by moving into an igloo with a heater inside.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":475977600000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":475977600000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Jan-31","y":1985,"m":1}]}
