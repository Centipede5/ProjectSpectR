Players traverse the island to find ingredients used to create items, while building and managing resort facilities. Players can also engage in turn-based combat with an assortment of fantastical creatures (e.g., slime monsters, lizard men, and golems). Weapon attacks and magic spells are selected from an on-screen menu; attack animations are played out and may include slashing sound effects and blinking to indicate damage inflicted. During the course of the game, some characters engage in suggestive dialogue (e.g., \". . . you have to feel sexy,\" \"I don't think it's possible for me to have a feeling of intimacy with Mr. Kyle,\" and \"Would you like to become my pupil and train to hunt girls?\"). The expletives \"dammit\" and \"hell\" appear in the dialogue, and a weapon called \"Bastard Sword\" can be found in the game.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/atelier-ds.jp\/annie\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atelier_Annie:_Alchemists_of_Sera_Island"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/atelier.wikia.com\/wiki\/Atelier_Annie:_Alchemists_of_Sera_Island"}]}
