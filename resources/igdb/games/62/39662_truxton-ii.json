Truxton II has six huge areas, each with a boss at the end; the game \"loops\" these six areas forever. Lives are given out at 70000 points, then every 200000 points after; players start with three. \n \nThere are power-ups to increase ship speed, add a smartbomb to your stock, and change\/strengthen your current weapon: red fires bombs in a small area around your ship, similar to the red weapon from Robo Aleste; blue is a homing laser, similar to the blue weapon from the original Truxton; while green fires wide-reaching salvos of green shots and more or less replaces the red weapon from Truxton.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,10209,10213,28029,36950,64204,10210,10212,27314,71455],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871882],"category":0,"keywords":[166,970],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":725760000000,"region":2,"human":"1992-Dec-31","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Tatsujin Oh","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ud319mx4noxyquyllolb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ud319mx4noxyquyllolb","width":850,"height":1187},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
