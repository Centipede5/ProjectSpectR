I'd define it as slow, sluggish and unresponsive, which is a shame, as the game is an obvious homage to Racing Destruction Set. There is a large number of user-created tracks included, and you can make your own. You can even adjust the gravity (on top of the default \"earth\" mode, the gravity on tracks can be that of any of the other planets, the moon or the sun). If they had gotten the controls right, this could have been something to write home about.","popularity":2.333333333333333,"publishers":[13934],"category":0,"first_release_date":851990400000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":851990400000,"human":"1996","y":1996,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ogsr0u17jih0k6mkktzz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ogsr0u17jih0k6mkktzz","width":608,"height":512}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z6305s0kpavgf8wqrcxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z6305s0kpavgf8wqrcxl","width":824,"height":1000}}
