Each rewards him with his legendary wargear, transforming his abilities in Battle and Campaign. Wurrzag has three quest-chains, bestowing him with The Baleful Mask, The Bonewood Staff and his Squiggly Beast.","storyline":"Wurrzag Da Great Green Prophet \n \nWizards are widely considered to be touched by the divine, which is unsurprising when one considers the maelstrom of forces they routinely channel. In this regard however, the Savage Orc Shaman Wurrzag is in a league of his own. \n \nThe greatest herald of Gork and Mork, he appears in battle as a gyrating lunatic, actively seeking out the heart of the conflict where wizards normally fear to tread. Indeed, when Wurrzag is present, those gifted in the magical arts are advised to steer a wide berth, as magical mishaps are rumoured to befall those nearby. \n \nHe inspires his Savage Orc cohorts with a brutal battle-fervour, driving them to ever-greater acts of ferocity, and supporting them further with spells and incantations as he races around the field atop his fearsome War Boar Spleenrippa.","collection":2651,"franchise":977,"franchises":[977,509],"popularity":1,"game":9898,"games":[18180,16319,89989,9105,46133,8734,8061,26481,27608,17448],"tags":[536872230,536874009],"developers":[111],"publishers":[23,112],"category":1,"keywords":[1318,3097],"first_release_date":1476921600000,"platforms":[6,92,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1476921600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Oct-20","y":2016,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1476921600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Oct-20","y":2016,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1476921600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Oct-20","y":2016,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1476921600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Oct-20","y":2016,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mnpua2kzxumatwbtpcil.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mnpua2kzxumatwbtpcil","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hchdukceqdra7ewtldkp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hchdukceqdra7ewtldkp","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aucb2xj9ofwwwruphnpv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aucb2xj9ofwwwruphnpv","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ysyfghhflnkwjmio2qbw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ysyfghhflnkwjmio2qbw","width":460,"height":656},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/404015\/Total_War_WARHAMMER__Wurrzag"}]}
