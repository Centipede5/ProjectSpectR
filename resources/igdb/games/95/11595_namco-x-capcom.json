The game centers around two original characters created for the game named Reiji Arisu and Xiaomu. The two of them work for a special unit called Shinra and they are tasked with investigating spirit and otherworldly disturbances. The game is a hybrid of an action role-playing and a tactical role-playing. Movement is done on a square grid with turns being determined by figuring out which character has the highest AP. On the player's turn, he or she can move his character into position and choose to attack an enemy.","collection":1308,"franchise":891,"franchises":[891,792],"popularity":2,"games":[36608,16468,59516,13196,55289,28010,25311,26769,37088,49414],"tags":[1,268435468,268435480,536871987,1073741827],"developers":[1119],"publishers":[263],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1075],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,24],"first_release_date":1117065600000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1117065600000,"region":5,"human":"2005-May-26","y":2005,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3 \u30af\u30ed\u30b9 \u30ab\u30d7\u30b3\u30f3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"videos":[{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"hIgRgZyGbb0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nxxqjcropxtuugrwhbni.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nxxqjcropxtuugrwhbni","width":400,"height":569},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.bandainamcogames.co.jp\/cs\/list\/namco_x_capcom\/"}]}
