Players can set up colonies, develop their industry and technology, build an army, and fight other armies in battles. Presented from a top-down perspective, the game depicts small soldiers attacking each other with swords, spears, rifles, and cannons. Damage is indicated by hit points floating above characters' heads, brief cries of pain, and bodies that fall down then disappear from the battlefield. Players can also build and use breweries to produce beer, which is then traded or sold for favors. Characters occasionally use the word damn in the dialogue.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters.\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/ubi.com\/US\/Games\/Info.aspx?pId=8591"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
