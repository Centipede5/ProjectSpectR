Battle mode (the standard Bomberman game), is joined by tennis, golf and baseball games. At the center of all this is the Living mode, a character building feature in which the player can design a Bomberman for use in any of the battle modes. \n \nBattle Mode is the centerpiece of this and all other Bomberman games. This mode is essentially the standard Bomberman formula; in the game, players navigate grid-based mazes, planting bombs in an attempt to hit other players (while avoided being hit by a bomb themselves). There are several different variations of Battle Mode, although they all center around the standard Bomberman gameplay. \n \nClassic Battle: A standard deathmatch-type game. \nStar Battle: Collect the most stars. \nCrown Battle: Find the crown in the level to win the game. \nPoint Battle: Earn the most points by killing opponents \nReplay: Watched game sessions saved to memory card.","collection":549,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,34919,36608,70906,37094,16468,27266,28113,29525,23175],"tags":[1,268435465,536871186,536871684,536875240,536875271],"category":0,"keywords":[274,772,4328,4359],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1122854400000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1122854400000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Aug-01","y":2005,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Bomberman Battles","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qbyjh6vt73cx5k2msbh8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qbyjh6vt73cx5k2msbh8","width":1525,"height":2133}}
