It allows up to four players simultaneously, and the player competes in races with three other cars. It is possible to upgrade the car at a Parts Shop. Every time a player falls off screen, they will be penalized by having gas subtracted from their gas meter. If the gas meter reaches \"0\", the game is over. The player can pick up flashing targets symbolized with a \"G\". By picking up the target, 20 units gas will be added to the player's gas meter. If the player successfully crosses the finish line, they will be rewarded additional units of gas.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":570672000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":570672000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Feb-01","y":1988,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nvttsxjhfc6b74ebtxil.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nvttsxjhfc6b74ebtxil","width":992,"height":768}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ot3d1y5yuppllfxnodlm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ot3d1y5yuppllfxnodlm","width":850,"height":1203}}
