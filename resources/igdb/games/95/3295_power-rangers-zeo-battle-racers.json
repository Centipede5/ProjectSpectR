Besides several obstacles and speed energizers scattered by the courses, players can attack opponents by firing Blasters (a la Super Mario Kart special items) at your adversaries; the limit is 5 Blasters per race except by Cog Soldier's infinite Blaster amount. \n \nAlong with 1-Player game modes (Race, Time Trial and VS CPU), the game also offers 2-Player split-screen gameplay through Race and 2P VS plus 3 alternative modalities: Point Race, where players must to race over objects to earn points; Bumper Chase, with the main objective to ram the opponent off the course; and Blaster Master, a Life Energy-based deathmatch.","collection":3148,"franchise":147,"franchises":[147],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27378,55192,40470,3772,76566,27553,12347,75244,67685,64284],"tags":[268435466,536870969,536874337,536875069,536875117,536875289,536875464,536875585,536876208,536876694,536880072,536882033],"developers":[716],"publishers":[1725],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[57,3425,4157,4205,4377,4552,4673,5296,5782,9160,11121],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":842918400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":842918400000,"human":"1996-Sep-17","y":1996,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pcviwf4zm0t8ijvuxbbd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pcviwf4zm0t8ijvuxbbd","width":1000,"height":1414},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3}}
