It is similar to Sega Rally Championship in design, but uses touring cars instead of rally cars. Unlike Sega Rally Championship, Sega Touring Car Championship has never seen a sequel, and it considered a far less successful game for a variety of reasons, most notably the steep difficulty curve and often awkward car handing.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":823132800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":823132800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-01","y":1996,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x7skebm2gkqy44zkzaqn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x7skebm2gkqy44zkzaqn","width":850,"height":1105}}
