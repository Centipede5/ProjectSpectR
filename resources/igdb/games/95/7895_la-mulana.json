{"id":7895,"name":"La-Mulana","slug":"la-mulana","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/la-mulana","created_at":1414452907384,"updated_at":1540221185534,"summary":"La-Mulana is a 2D side-scrolling platform game, first released on May 27, 2005 in Japan for Microsoft Windows that features graphics and an interface inspired by MSX games. The game is a traditional action-adventure game, reminiscent of Metroid games. This game was originally only available in Japanese, but an English translation patch has been produced by Ian Kelley of AGTP.","storyline":"The protagonist of the game is Lemeza, a whip wielding adventurer similar to Indiana Jones exploring the tomb within La-Mulana. Although there is only one ending in the game there are many ways to get there, in that completing objectives in the game (gaining power ups and reaching new areas) is not linear, nor is there an obvious recommended path to take. Many powerups will allow you to reach new areas (similar to Super Metroid), but the game gives no indication of where to go.","collection":1068,"franchise":465,"franchises":[465],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[24426,28070,20342,80916,47823,28309,56033,81249,25300,29032],"tags":[1,17,27,38,268435464,268435465,268435487,268435488,536870946,536870990,536871038,536871115,536871170,536871277,536871332,536871333,536871817,536871939,536871945,536872099,536873157,1073741828],"developers":[3843],"publishers":[3843],"game_engines":[84],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":43200,"completely":216000},"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[34,78,126,203,258,365,420,421,905,1027,1033,1187,2245],"themes":[1,17,27,38],"genres":[8,9,31,32],"first_release_date":1117152000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1117152000000,"region":5,"human":"2005-May-27","y":2005,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"La Mulana","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Lamulana","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Mulana","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"\u30e9\u00b7\u30e0\u30e9\u30fc\u30ca","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kst3ioo2zq4yrvbhrnnr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kst3ioo2zq4yrvbhrnnr","width":1026,"height":710},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ulezhtkelvi0pjykucez.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ulezhtkelvi0pjykucez","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i6wdxr3tgynwpkergoaa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i6wdxr3tgynwpkergoaa","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cynzpb50pqvblpq9xmbu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cynzpb50pqvblpq9xmbu","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ipjzdeivyb9zpyf7bkxh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ipjzdeivyb9zpyf7bkxh","width":1015,"height":704}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"wNQAbf0P17E"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vwj5kt7jcrd2auk8iyrf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vwj5kt7jcrd2auk8iyrf","width":512,"height":270}}
