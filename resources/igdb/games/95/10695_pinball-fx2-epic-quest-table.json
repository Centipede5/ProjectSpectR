One such knight is Max, whose enthusiasm for combat is surpassed only by his love of rare and valuable loot.\n\nJoin Max as he battles hordes of evil (or just evil-looking) monsters, rescues a wealthy princess, and accumulates the loot and xp that make good worth doing. If Max suffers a defeat, never fear! He will return in the next game with all of his hard-won loot and experience levels intact.","collection":1418,"popularity":1,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"category":0,"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fcettgiolleuuxgqschu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fcettgiolleuuxgqschu","width":505,"height":284}]}
