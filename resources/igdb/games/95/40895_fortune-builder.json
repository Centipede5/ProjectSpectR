Race against time to achieve your financial goal in a One-Player Game or compete with another tycoon in a Two-Player Game. Either way. \nFORTUNE BUILDER is a challenge. Your community will be laid out on a map of undeveloped land, consisting of a seacoast with beachfront. two mountain ranges, midlands, a river and a lake, with a main highway running north and south. You'll start with a fixed amount of cash, enabling you to buy and build a large variety of proper-ties: hotels, condos, marinas, factories, malls, gas stations and numerous other facilities. \nThe challenge is to build them where they will draw the most traffic, thereby increasing profits. And all the while, you must keep an eye on bulletins that may affect your efforts, watching for changes in every-thing from consumer trends to the weather.
