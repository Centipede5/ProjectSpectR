It plays just like Gradius, with the same power-up system, but features a far more bizarre and imaginative series of levels and characters. \nThis game was released in Japan for the PC Engine and is a port of the Arcade original with a couple of differences: it doesn't have the arcade Stages 5 and 8, but features a stage titled SPECIAL and a new introduction that features several strange-looking Japanese characters. This is in contrast to the arcade intro, which chronicles the Gradius legacy up until the time of release.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":701136000000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":701136000000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Mar-21","y":1992,"m":3}]}
