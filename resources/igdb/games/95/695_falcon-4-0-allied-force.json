The game is based around a realistic simulation of the Block 50\/52 F-16 Fighting Falcon in a series of missions in the Balkans. The game engine is based on the source code of the original 1998 Falcon 4.0 from MicroProse, and consists largely of a collection of improvements from the official patches and extensive Falcon modding community.
