It is a port of Kaneko's 1988 arcade shoot-'em-up Heavy Unit. Humans have developed an artificial planet, \"Le Tau,\" which is being attacked by aliens, and only the Heavy Unit transforming ship can stop them. A and C shoot; rapidfire is an option. B drops a bomb, which you have an unlimited supply of but must collect as a powerup. Among the various powerups is one, labeled T, that transforms your ship into a mecha and back, which plays identically, except its bombs will home in on enemies.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,32902,10039,68287,68142,28751,24920,272],"tags":[1,268435461,536879159],"category":0,"keywords":[8247],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r6awnufc3ncxdiyhqmt8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r6awnufc3ncxdiyhqmt8","width":236,"height":317}}
