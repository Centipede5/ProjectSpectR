Each screen is separate from the others, and involves trying to collect a key and then progress through the exit. Enemies are best dealt with by shooting one of your longer-range weapons towards them and waiting for it to hit them - this will release at least one coin, for points. Improved weapons can be collected, each of which functions for a limited number of shots. Bonus items are often located in the more precarious parts of the level, leading you to choose whether to risk losing a life, and going back to the start of the screen (although previously killed creatures remain dead when you lose a life)","popularity":1,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[114,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gmtcmvtx2q2xx90pfzcj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gmtcmvtx2q2xx90pfzcj","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aholtcbagfboeiay6ojo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aholtcbagfboeiay6ojo","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yplz1aa2zofoec860xk2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yplz1aa2zofoec860xk2","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yh3ysgeabl1hyqei2wjq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yh3ysgeabl1hyqei2wjq","width":630,"height":709}}
