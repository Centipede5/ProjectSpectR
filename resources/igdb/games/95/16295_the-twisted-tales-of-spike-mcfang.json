But is it really his handiwork, or is there someone else controlling him? Unravel the mystery while traveling to various locales, fighting Von Hesler's henchmen and picking up (CPU-controlled) companions along the way. \n \nSpike McFang has three main methods of attack: by striking out with his cape, throwing his hat like a boomerang, or using a magic card. Cards can also heal his health or give his companions extra strength. Spike can also devour the still-beating hearts of his vanquished foes (or the dropped tomatoes of his vanquished foes if you're playing the sanitized North American version) to regain health. There are a total of four different hats that Spike can purchase as upgrades in his battle against animated garlic bulbs, bomb-throwing cats, head-spinning plants and a plethora of other dangerous enemies.","collection":3863,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[22747,27092,28309,80916,68441,36950,36198,55092,28168,55038],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871086,536871123,536871208,536871931,536871938,536872419,536875081,536875100,536875108,536875130,536875181,536875196,536875231,536875232,536875258,536875362,536876030,536877058,536878052,536881992,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,174,211,296,1019,1026,1507,4169,4188,4196,4218,4269,4284,4319,4320,4346,4450,5118,6146,7140,11080],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":732499200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":732499200000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Mar-19","y":1993,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Chou Makai Taisen: Dorabocchan","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/udg0k4ocs6tkxzy9ryff.jpg","cloudinary_id":"udg0k4ocs6tkxzy9ryff","width":312,"height":263}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ebon8ooyou0jedlrticr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ebon8ooyou0jedlrticr","width":640,"height":449}}
