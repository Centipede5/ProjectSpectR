Though it may contain some minute differences from the main series, it remains true to it. This game's aim (as the others' are), is to capture Carmen's gang of thieves, one by one until all of her henchmen have been caught. This is done by searching for clues, trailing them, identifying them and finally, bringing them in for trial. After all of the henchmen have been caught, the player must then go after Carmen herself. One of the main differences is that the player can receive in-game help.","collection":691,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[251,25222,29526,65503,18011,20342,24426,27266,36044,56033],"tags":[34,268435465,268435487,536871127,536871446,536871939,536872216,536875631,536875789,536880769],"category":0,"keywords":[215,534,1027,1304,4719,4877,9857],"themes":[34],"genres":[9,31],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ezfdzsk07k3agv4bcfcr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ezfdzsk07k3agv4bcfcr","width":249,"height":320}}
