The game's protagonist, Ashley Mizuki Robbins, is the daughter of Richard and Sayoko Robbins, researchers of human memory. After her parents mysteriously went missing in 1994, they were presumed dead.Consequently, Ashley was raised by her father's younger sister, Jessica Robbins, in the suburbs of Seattle. Eleven years later, two days before her fourteenth birthday, Ashley receives a package from her father containing a birthday card and a device called a DAS. The DAS, programmed to respond only to Ashley's biometrics, contains a message from her father, claiming that he is waiting for her on Blood Edward Island. \nAssuming control of Ashley Robbins, players navigate through 3D environments and attempt to solve puzzles. During movement, the touchscreen displays an aerial view of Ashley and her surroundings. The player can move Ashley using a point and click system, dragging the stylus across the screen, or using the D-pad. The top screen shows pre-rendered images of the player's current location. To solve puzzles encountered in the game, the player must use the touchscreen, or other DS capabilities, such as the DS microphone.","collection":4639,"rating":60.1807820683748,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":65.0903910341874,"total_rating_count":6,"rating_count":5,"games":[25222,8762,18011,24426,20342,36044,56033,51524,26870,13524],"tags":[31,268435458,268435465,268435487,536870928,536871006,536871109,536871878,536871939,536872222,536872225,536872328,536873787,536875057,536875103,536875637,536875639,536876032,536877076,536882441,536883537],"developers":[2091],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[16,94,197,966,1027,1310,1313,1416,2875,4145,4191,4725,4727,5120,6164,11529,12625],"themes":[31],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":1109203200000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1109203200000,"region":5,"human":"2005-Feb-24","y":2005,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1119571200000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Jun-24","y":2005,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1120694400000,"region":3,"human":"2005-Jul-07","y":2005,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1127692800000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Sep-26","y":2005,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Another Code\nAnother Code: Two Memories","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Trace Memory: R - A Journey into Lost Memories","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30a2\u30ca\u30b6\u30fc\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9 \uff12\u3064\u306e\u8a18\u61b6 "},{"name":"Trace Memory"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k18tuo9ylejaztqnbxi7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k18tuo9ylejaztqnbxi7","width":300,"height":190},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ds8y0hysgogkrgtwwqqa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ds8y0hysgogkrgtwwqqa","width":235,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ku26ixrxkfofsxxns4sf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ku26ixrxkfofsxxns4sf","width":418,"height":230},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ofhm9avlfo5lgm7kq2t4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ofhm9avlfo5lgm7kq2t4","width":400,"height":297},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/crrsvxvyoik5io2fhvnl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"crrsvxvyoik5io2fhvnl","width":256,"height":384}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"8n6XBV7BoYs"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wzd0brviqwrlv5xthgef.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wzd0brviqwrlv5xthgef","width":250,"height":227},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Another_Code:_Two_Memories"}]}
