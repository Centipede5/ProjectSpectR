You have to be the best - and not just at Pool but also at the tactical game that is Billiards and the ultimate test of ball control, Snooker. \n \nThe stakes in World of Pool could not be higher. Go to another player\u2019s house and see what takes your fancy \u2013 a nice new cue, a jukebox, or even a vase. Challenge your opponent and if you win the item is yours for your very own crib. But be careful, because if you lose your own crib is going to be raided. As losing is not an option its time to play dirty \u2013 taunt your opponent to distract them, soften the cushions so the balls don\u2019t bounce \u2013 do whatever it takes to win.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1281744000000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1281744000000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Aug-14","y":2010,"m":8}]}
