Players are armed with a variety of weapons (chainsaws, grenades, machine guns, etc...) and a full range of unarmed combat moves (including the good old-fashioned crotch kick) all of which can be used to defend the goal but remember, the best defense is a good offense. \n \nDBZ also has many of the features you would expect from a typical sports game including player development, league and season management, and stat tracking (scores, kills, etc...).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11253,68287,25300,36950,71455,27314,22690,19448,64204,25311],"tags":[1,18,268435470,536870991,536871882,536872078,536875179,536875262,536875299,536875358,536875406,536876125,536876823,536878212,536879218,536884032],"category":0,"keywords":[79,970,1166,4267,4350,4387,4446,4494,5213,5911,7300,8306,13120],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":907200000000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":907200000000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Oct-01","y":1998,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a04ae8cvtyc7cl8txuqf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a04ae8cvtyc7cl8txuqf","width":211,"height":250}}
