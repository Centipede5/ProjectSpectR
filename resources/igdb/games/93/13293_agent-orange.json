It isn't that the job is well paid either. most Skilled space pilots \nearn more than the \"Flying Farmers\" as our nickname goes - but they don't carry the future of the \nworld on their shoulders, do they? \n\tThe IARE was founded to fuse the convergent disciplines of Agriculture and Space Travel into a \nforce which would make the colonisation of other planets more practical and simple. If one is being \nabsolutely truthful, it was the discovery of an Astalan alien agricultural station that made the genetic \nbreakthrough possible despite the IARE's claim that their genetic engineering labs were responsible. \nThe Capture of an alien seedpod and the genetic analysis which followed allowed us to realise that \nfarming on other planets was not only possible but could actually be productive too. \n\tFrom this discovery, it was a simple step for the college to set up entrepreneurial types like me as \nself-employed space farmers who would plant and harvest crops and bring the valuable cargo back \nto Earth for sale. Only the very best survive this life for long but it's a challenge that I certainly \ncouldn't refuse. \n\tThe greatest unsolved problem at the IARE is that of the farmer's traditional enemy - weeds. Yes, \nweeds do grow on other planets and we have no way of controlling them. The Astalans have a \nweedkiller, we can read the references to it on their seed storage pods, but we can't synthesise it at \nall. It is every Flying Farmer's aim to one day capture some \"Agent Orange\", a name taken from \nanther weedkiller used in a war during the 20th Century, but it is so far away from the Earth that no \none has yet managed to find any. \n \nWell I have to go now, my first mother-ship is ready and I have been assigned my acreage, actually 8 \nplanets, so time to blast off and get planting!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,36950,76722,76246,19341,306,64204,17522,10039],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,1073741827],"publishers":[5533],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ahmpbn044awkpzzmwthy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ahmpbn044awkpzzmwthy","width":401,"height":520}}
