Led by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, a former engineer of the neighbouring Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&ER), a scheme to build the West Somerset Railway was submitted.Opening on 31 March 1862 for passenger services, the line become an important route for holidaymakers heading to the seaside, as well as carrying coal and iron-ore from the mines and ports of Somerset. Passing loops and extended platforms were added over the years to manage the increasing number of passengers and freight operations, and the line was converted from broad gauge to standard gauge in 1882.However, despite a Butlins holiday camp opening at Minehead in 1962, the line was recommended for closure in the 1962 Reshaping of British Railways report, and the last passenger service ran on 2 January 1971.Just a month after closure, a working party was tasked with reopening the line as a privately owned railway, such was its importance to the tourism industry. With support from Somerset County Council and the Minehead Railway Preservation Society, the line reopened as a heritage railway on 28 March 1976 between Minehead and Blue Anchor, and to Bishops Lydeard three years later.At 20 miles, the line is the longest standard gauge heritage railway in the UK, running through some of Somerset\u2019s most picturesque landscapes. The line is also popular with enthusiasts and rail fans due to its resident roster of GWR and S&DJR locomotives, and regular visiting locomotives on rail tours or for galas.Starting out on the sea front at Minehead, the line heads south east along the coast to Dunster and Watchet, before heading inland to Williton where the oldest signal box on the line stands. Climbing out of Williton along the side of the Quantock Hills \u2013 where passengers are afforded stunning views across the Somerset countryside \u2013 the line reaches its summit at Crowcombe Heathfield before descending down the steep 1 in 81 decline to Bishops Lydeard.Included with the route are three of the railway\u2019s most popular locomotives - Class 7F \u2018No. 88\u2019 in Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway livery, GWR Hall Class \u2018Raveningham Hall\u2019 and BR Green Class 33 \u2018D6575\u2019. Accompanying these locomotives are appropriate BR Mk1 coaching stock and GWR\/BR freight wagons.ScenariosNine scenarios for the route:\tWSR Simple Controls\tWSR: Driving a Steam Locomotive\tWSR Driving a Diesel Locomotive\tWest Somerset Railway\tSanta Special\tFall by the Wayside\tA Summer Spin\tWatchet for the Storm\tThe Quantock Belle SpecialMore scenarios are available on Steam Workshop online and in-game.
