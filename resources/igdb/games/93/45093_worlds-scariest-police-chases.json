The game offers over 50 miles of road and highway to patrol. \n \nA story mode follows the player's virtual law enforcement career and he goes up against more devious criminals and gains access to more powerful vehicles. Other modes of play allow more freeform law enforcement. When driving for law and order doesn't fit the mood, players also have the option of evading their fellow officers in the game's \"Bad Boy\" mode. Television host Sheriff John Bunnel adds commentary as players race toward mission goals.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[86041,101172,99460,103316,76253,91140,1168,27378,103298,90688],"tags":[1,268435466],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":993081600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":993081600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jun-21","y":2001,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ai7mendaxmboplen8vgv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ai7mendaxmboplen8vgv","width":1400,"height":1407},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
