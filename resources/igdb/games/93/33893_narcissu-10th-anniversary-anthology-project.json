There are no miracles, no heroes, no villains in this story. Just life and the characters finding their own ways of facing death in an indifferent, relentless, ever-impartial reality.","rating":70,"popularity":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[28465,40524,34919,33603,36962,55888,44087,65827,28277,32283],"tags":[268435488],"publishers":[5325],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"genres":[32],"first_release_date":1453852800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1453852800000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Jan-27","y":2016,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jqzvbp4tw8ibkpo1e2os.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jqzvbp4tw8ibkpo1e2os","width":800,"height":596},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ookfmmtvoieuy8zraes5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ookfmmtvoieuy8zraes5","width":800,"height":596},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vvja2tb3hpnhosers7zl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vvja2tb3hpnhosers7zl","width":800,"height":596},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pxhxjdqficffc1kfe9q0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pxhxjdqficffc1kfe9q0","width":800,"height":596},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s9pvek7tsspx02bbwyi4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s9pvek7tsspx02bbwyi4","width":800,"height":596}],"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/426690"}],"external":{"steam":"426690"}}
