{"id":54793,"name":"Deep Sky Derelicts","slug":"deep-sky-derelicts","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/deep-sky-derelicts","created_at":1503141547481,"updated_at":1546612656520,"summary":"Deep Sky Derelicts will bring the players into the burdensome life of a society outcast, a scavenger trying to make a living, while aspiring for a better life of a full-fledged citizen. Players will be exploring derelict alien ships, fight, loot, hire mercenaries into their team, buy new weapons and upgrade their gear. The game\u2019s retro-futuristic comic book aesthetic style creates a distinctive dark atmosphere of deep space, unknown locations and lost dystopian society. Rogue-like elements featuring such popular mechanics as procedurally-generated dungeons, turn-based combat with card-based actions and lethal threat lurking around every corner, are here to draw the players into an unforgiving, yet fascinating world with its own unique lore.","storyline":"\u201cThey drift in the void. Desolate but not empty.\u201d \n \nIn a grim dystopian future, where mankind has scattered across the galaxy and the human society has split into two distinct classes, you are a poor stateless outcast forced to live off scraps from derelict alien stations and ships in the outer space, yet you dream of becoming a privileged citizen and living on the surface of a habitable planet, enjoying non-synthetic air, water and food. A fabled alien derelict ship somewhere within the Deep Sky sector of space is your voucher for a citizenship and a promise of cozy life on a hospitable planet. \n \nHire and control a squad of up to three mercenary characters and set on to explore derelict ships within your reach from the scavenger's base. Searching the derelicts for loot and clues, you come across many friendly inhabitants and traders, but more often \u2013 various enemies. Challenge and defeat them in tactical turn-based fights, where randomly-drawn cards form your changing arsenal of combat actions, gain experience for yourself and your crew, loot dead bodies, resupply and upgrade once back at your base. The scavenger's home ship gives you the opportunity to heal and level-up your mercenaries, recruit new ones, equip them, upgrade their gear or recharge energy for life support during missions.","hypes":2,"rating":60,"popularity":11.66666666666667,"aggregated_rating":67,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":3,"games":[25311,35994,55038,80916,25300,28309,36950,37419,30245,27092],"tags":[1,18,268435468,268435471,268435487,268435488,536871327,536871938,1073741828],"developers":[16440],"publishers":[157],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[415,1026],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[12,15,31,32],"first_release_date":1537920000000,"status":4,"pulse_count":8,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1537920000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Sep-26","y":2018,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1537920000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Sep-26","y":2018,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1537920000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Sep-26","y":2018,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qqrep6enggxhcnm8jhso.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qqrep6enggxhcnm8jhso","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/byh2zz4ztluysijuuupg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"byh2zz4ztluysijuuupg","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hvzvlkewfewu3bwtlqpd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hvzvlkewfewu3bwtlqpd","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/enrrmdu8rsmgaafm2wli.jpg","cloudinary_id":"enrrmdu8rsmgaafm2wli","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ydmy4jstod7vuluiyrmu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ydmy4jstod7vuluiyrmu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lw3kqekbrs5iwaqcbsc8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lw3kqekbrs5iwaqcbsc8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i6ydpheqn47qer7pqalm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i6ydpheqn47qer7pqalm","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ohdnmdj3ndph2qsfcoza.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ohdnmdj3ndph2qsfcoza","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mkcoddhimag3cgwaxmea.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mkcoddhimag3cgwaxmea","width":1920,"height":1080}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p1vhtau6sphaxkagn7t1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p1vhtau6sphaxkagn7t1","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qdpqpysgsv9b1wa3o7ox.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qdpqpysgsv9b1wa3o7ox","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/skzx0qe7hj3z0runyxzf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"skzx0qe7hj3z0runyxzf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/usbtjtfyi9w8cpqddbl9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"usbtjtfyi9w8cpqddbl9","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ht49bervzwzz3kdaaibv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ht49bervzwzz3kdaaibv","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"k3ZhDvcsjW8"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"fEdi1jli0hQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hr6uwrjytsyapaz2hdfh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hr6uwrjytsyapaz2hdfh","width":1000,"height":1411},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/698640"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.snowhoundgames.com\/deep-sky-derelicts\/"}],"external":{"steam":"698640"}}
