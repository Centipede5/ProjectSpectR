At times, lizards may chase the blobs around. The water bucket, when spilled, can cause the lizard to turn into a fish. If the fish remains there too long, however, it turns into a bird. The game was created by Nice Ideas, a division of Mattel that was located midway between Cannes and Nice.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":444441600000,"platforms":[68],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":68,"date":444441600000,"region":8,"human":"1984-Feb-01","y":1984,"m":2}]}
