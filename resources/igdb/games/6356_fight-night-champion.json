{"id":6356,"name":"Fight Night Champion","slug":"fight-night-champion","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/fight-night-champion","created_at":1398127991465,"updated_at":1541192892978,"summary":"Fight Night Champion is a boxing video game developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports. It is the fifth entry in the Fight Night series and was released on March 1, 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game takes a drastic turn from its predecessors, depicting a \"grittier\", \"darker\" setting with animations and player damage that \"truly conveys the brutality of the sport of boxing.\"","storyline":"Andre Bishop is a boxer serving time in a correctional facility. After winning a jailhouse boxing match against another inmate, he is cornered and brutally beaten by several prisoners including his opponent. Bishop wakes up severely injured and damaged. The game then flashes back 4 years to his rise as a professional fighter.\n\nBishop's pro career begins after defeating 9-time amateur champion Joel Savon, which earns him significant recognition as a contender. After a few successful bouts, he and his trainer Gus Carisi are approached by DL McQueen, famed fight promoter and longtime foe of Carisi who offers to promote Andre under the management of his daughter Meagan. The two refuse, causing a dispute between the crooked promoter and Bishop. McQueen continues to urge Andre to sign a deal with him, only to be denied each time. He soon frames Andre of police assault with the help of two crooked cops. Andre is then sentenced to over 5 years in prison.\n\nAfter a series of fights inside of jail Andre is framed and ambushed in the showers where he gets a rough beating. Soon after recovering from his injuries, Andre begins to train himself and keep fit while imprisoned. He is angered to discover that his brother Raymond had become a professional heavyweight with McQueen Promotions, the company that framed him. Soon after being released, Raymond organizes him a job as an assistant trainer. Now a heavyweight and a focused fighter, Andre beats two ranked heavyweights during regular sparring sessions. Meagan approaches him soon after and offers to get him a new professional license, having split from her father's business due to disagreements. Gus returns as Andre's trainer and helps him make an unexpected comeback as a heavyweight.\n\nFollowing several successful heavyweight bouts, Andre's brother Raymond challenges him to a fight to secure a chance against the world heavyweight champion Isaac Frost. During the fight, Andre goes down but does not get up to allow his brother a chance at the title. Raymond then fights Frost, and is defeated in the first round by a devastating KO. Angered, Andre challenges Frost himself and manages to defeat him by KO. He becomes the world heavyweight champion, and McQueen is arrested after his crooked business with the framing of Andre is revealed.","collection":645,"rating":87.0922011368402,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":83.2,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":85.14610056842011,"total_rating_count":24,"rating_count":16,"games":[5836,17548,102134,36911,17130,3915,6993,65832,90101,19588],"tags":[1,31,268435460,268435469,268435470,536871019,536871041,536871105,536871544,536871889,536872060,536872205,536875046,536875157,536875184,536875225,536875359,536875360,536875455,536875572,536875781,536875932,536876210,536876356,536876498,536876695,536876722,536876802,536876804,536876835,536876929,536877031,536877223,536877288,536877674,536877702,536877943,536878403,536878419,536879917,536880415,536881357,536881505,536883464,536883465,536883466,536890887,536892347,536892348,536892349,1073741826],"developers":[277],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[107,129,193,632,977,1148,1293,4134,4245,4272,4313,4447,4448,4543,4660,4869,5020,5298,5444,5586,5783,5810,5890,5892,5923,6017,6119,6311,6376,6762,6790,7031,7491,7507,9005,9503,10445,10593,12552,12553,12554,19975,21435,21436,21437],"themes":[1,31],"genres":[4,13,14],"first_release_date":1298937600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1299715200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Mar-10","y":2011,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1299196800000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Mar-04","y":2011,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1298937600000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Mar-01","y":2011,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1298937600000,"human":"2011-Mar-01","y":2011,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1298937600000,"human":"2011-Mar-01","y":2011,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Fight Night: Champion"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hjp1lgf7wf04wgswzgbx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hjp1lgf7wf04wgswzgbx","width":650,"height":366}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"nepBG1PtFd0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ys3bqs1scnlzb31emzbg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ys3bqs1scnlzb31emzbg","width":1000,"height":1064},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/www.ea.com\/fight-night"}]}
