{"id":7421,"name":"Space Run: Fast and Safe Delivery","slug":"space-run-fast-and-safe-delivery","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/space-run-fast-and-safe-delivery","created_at":1403431423913,"updated_at":1517270572565,"summary":"Space Run is a PC game that mixes strategy and space ship construction in real time, borrowing certain mechanics from the \u201ctower defense\u201d system with numerous twists and hyper dynamic gameplay. Space Run is a nod to \u201880s science fiction and pays homage to many of its tropes and references.\n\nThe year is 2525. You are Captain Buck Mann, a Space Runner whose job is to transport valuable cargo from one end of the galaxy to the other... and one thing\u2019s for sure: it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride! Not only do the cosmic highways regularly pass through asteroid belts of all sizes, but they are also used by dangerous and unscrupulous pirates armed to the teeth, whose fighters and battle cruisers will make short work of your transport vessel if you\u2019re totally unprepared.\nFulfil your contracts with gusto and your reputation will soar, opening the doors to new clients and more demanding and hazardous assignments... but which will also be more lucrative! Unlock new modules for your ship or upgrade those you already own: laser turrets, missile launchers, shield generators, thrusters, power plants and other modules will allow you to adapt to new combat situations in mid-flight that arise on your travels. Build, recycle, repair and reposition the modules and improvise as best you can to deal with the multiple threats you will face.\n\nRetry the first missions with the advanced modules you\u2019ve just unlocked to improve your score, and challenge your friends to do better!","storyline":"The Year is 2525, space is no longer \"the final frontier\". Mankind has spread out to the farthest reaches of the known galaxy. Thing is, those far reaches are dangerous, filled with space pirates, deadly asteroids, hostile aliens, random anomalies, and maybe even a strange space monster. But that doesn\u2019t mean the people living out there still don\u2019t want stuff. That\u2019s where you come in.\n\nYou are captain Buck Mann (kind of an ironic since you don\u2019t have a buck to your name).\n\nYou\u2019re a \"thirtysomething\" year old pilot, but truthfully you don\u2019t really care about age. Age is just a number and you\u2019ve never been all that good with numbers. The only number that matters to you is being number one. You pride yourself in being the best fraking pilot in the galaxy, if not the universe. You once flew for Earth Force. Later you became a hot item on the space racing tour. You are a rugged individualist, your own man, a man\u2019s man.\nProblem is, you do have a bit of a gambling \"habit\". That gets you in trouble time and again. For your latest incidents, you were holding Aces over Kings a full house, a sure winner. Hard to believe you lost everything to some mutant who had four threes. Then you failed to cover the spread on the humans vs androids rugby game. You had the androids, but never anticipated that EMP blast. Long story short, you now owe the mob a LOT of credits. Being out of money and in debt over your head, you are forced to accept jobs piloting big bulky cargo ships. Much to your chagrin you are now a \"Space Runner\" making Space Run after Space Run.\nStill, you have the courage, knowhow and mojo to get the job done! You have two mottos you use depending on the customer. \"Fast safe delivery!\" - \"When you need it there yesterday!\".\nIf somebody has a package they need delivered, you\u2019re the man to do it, no questions asked. Well there is one question asked: how much does it pay?\nYour crew\n\nAdaam-12: an android who is one of a kind (well more likely 12 of a kind) he is your co-pilot, your second in command, your right hand man, eh machine.\n\nHe is constantly by your side. You won him in a black jack game. He knows pretty much everything and he is programmed to be ever helpful and full of ideas.\n\nYet this somehow doesn\u2019t stop him from being snarky. Sometimes you think he thinks you work for him.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":76.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":76.5,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[33603,36962,55888,65827,32283,75065,75813,55308,25640,18623],"tags":[268435471,268435488,536871882,1073741827],"developers":[3076],"publishers":[110],"game_engines":[186],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"keywords":[970],"genres":[15,32],"first_release_date":1402704000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1402704000000,"human":"2014-Jun-14","y":2014,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Space Run"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qsa8hktmroz2egp5no97.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qsa8hktmroz2egp5no97","width":1920,"height":984}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"NXob0jrfvQs"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"gPfrVOLU-Xk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qovodduld7ohznij1are.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qovodduld7ohznij1are","width":700,"height":350},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/spacerun-thegame.com\/"}]}
