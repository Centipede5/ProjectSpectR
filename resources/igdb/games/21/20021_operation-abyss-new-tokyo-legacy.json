As players explore dungeons and labyrinths, they engage in turn-based battles against a variety of fantastical Variants (e.g., demons, mutant animals, robots). Players select attack moves from a series of menus; characters flinch when attacked as their hit points decrease. A handful of cutscenes depict corpses lying among large pools of blood; still-screen images sometimes depict dismembered torsos with visible intestines. Some demon characters are depicted topless (without nipples), with exaggerated-sized breasts. The word \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/nisamerica.com\/games\/operation-abyss-new-tokyo-legacy\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/541450"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Operation_Abyss:_New_Tokyo_Legacy"}],"external":{"steam":"541450"}}
