{"id":49021,"name":"Serpent","slug":"serpent","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/serpent","created_at":1499974361210,"updated_at":1527489500426,"summary":"Serpent (\u304b\u3053\u3080\u3093\u86c7 Kakomunja) is a Game Boy snake game exclusive for the North American and Japanese markets. \n \nIn the future, there is a sport called Serpent. Two fighters in serpentine robotic machines try to box each other in to win the fight. The serpents are detailed in the fact that they aren't just a line, giving a greater sense of realism to the game. Each snake has a fixed amount of lives; with losing a life being a representation of \"losing the war.\" The \"game over\" message is a simple message saying \"the bitter taste of defeat\" with an animated picture of a snake crying and accompanied by a melancholic music in a waltz rhythm. \n \nThere are two modes with four difficulty levels; level 1 is considered to be the easiest (normal speed and enemy performance) while level 4 is the hardest (fast speed and enemies are likely to cheat death). The first mode allows players to simply compete against an opponent while the second mode brings in a series of small snakes that emerge when players take too long conquering a level. Missiles can be launched when the player collects them on the field. White numbers help the player develop a longer body while black numbers make the body shorter. \n \nMissiles can either make the enemy faster (black missiles) or slower (white missiles). Winning 7 of the 13 possible matches automatically makes the player into the \"champion of serpents.\"","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55036,27092,77597,32510,25311,34269,29173,17613,36553,9472],"tags":[1,268435471,536871487,536872651,536872668,536874694,536875870],"developers":[2839],"publishers":[1136,2839],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[575,1739,1756,3782,4958,17184],"themes":[1],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":639360000000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":639360000000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Apr-06","y":1990,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":657417600000,"region":2,"human":"1990-Nov-01","y":1990,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Kakomunja","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"\u304b\u3053\u3080\u3093\u86c7","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Kakomun Hebi","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cq0pe4nhcrc5d1vapz2p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cq0pe4nhcrc5d1vapz2p","width":314,"height":284},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e9vqto8u6ogbhvr1crnu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e9vqto8u6ogbhvr1crnu","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uoogbk86jjp8yckxubu1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uoogbk86jjp8yckxubu1","width":803,"height":1100},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fikzycpducp3bapgwpmh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fikzycpducp3bapgwpmh","width":800,"height":802},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sipnphledpnix2bikb2d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sipnphledpnix2bikb2d","width":500,"height":503}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"rfahrQKcwHQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mqauevu7kouedmr2vls6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mqauevu7kouedmr2vls6","width":330,"height":380},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Serpent_%28video_game%29"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":33,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2}]}
