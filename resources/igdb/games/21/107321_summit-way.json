Choose each bridge carefully as they can't cross each other, can't be too steep and they may offend the inhabitants of the attached hills! \n \nSummit Way is ad-supported, with optional donations to hide the ads and support the game development. \n \nSummit Way offers 10 regions with a total of 72 levels, from a relaxing start to more challenging levels towards the end. Start off by finding any solution to the first few levels, letting yourself be guided by the sound of the wood falling in place. And then, challenge yourself by finding the shortest possible path to earn a 4 stars score on all levels, and share the trickiest solutions with your friends!\"","popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[16316],"publishers":[16316],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[9,15,32],"first_release_date":1534809600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1534809600000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Aug-21","y":2018,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1534809600000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Aug-21","y":2018,"m":8}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"i5rEVtrVrhU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bctv3yvdifbfvckypwlk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bctv3yvdifbfvckypwlk","width":360,"height":360},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=net.xymus.mn"},{"category":11,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/ca\/app\/summit-way\/id1335760749?platform=ipad"},{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/ca\/app\/summit-way\/id1335760749?platform=iphone"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/xymus.net\/summitway\/"}]}
