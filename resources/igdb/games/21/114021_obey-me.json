A former human-turned-lesser-devil named Vanessa Held works for one of these demons: Ammon, the Archduke of Avarice. She\u2019ll fight alongside her Hellhound companion, Monty, against violent denizens from above and below on an unholy quest where she\u2019ll unravel a conspiracy surrounding her. \n \nTo survive on these bloody streets, the hellish pair coordinate Vanessa\u2019s savage skills, weaponry and evasive teleportation with Monty\u2019s feral attacks, and magical skills super-powered by his elemental transformations. By absorbing the souls of her fallen foes, Vanessa can upgrade her weapons to learn more vicious combos, as well as upgrading Monty\u2019s transformations. \n \nThey can also combine their powers through a Fusion Mode, which merges the pair together to become an avatar of destruction, with the ability to unleash the deadly Soul Overload attack when the Fusion bar is full.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"category":0,"pulse_count":1}
