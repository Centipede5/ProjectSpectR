The Virtua Fighter series has been heralded before as the fighting game with most involving gameplay. \n \nIn Fighters Megamix, another game has been added, a game called Fighting Vipers. Fighting Vipers has drastically different gameplay than the more popular Virtua Fighter 2. Instead of being sophisticated, Fighting Vipers is simplified to appeal to a wider audience of video gamers and was meant for \"casual\" gamers. \n \nMixing a simplistic video game and a sophisticated video game must have been difficult. But Fighters Megamix manages to do so by offering many options. The most important option available is the choice of having Fighters Megamix run under the Fighting Vipers style of gameplay or the Virtua Fighter 2 style of gameplay. Other options are unlockable while playing the game. \n \nOne good thing about mixing two games into one is that the game would include more selectable characters. Not only are there the 22 characters from Virtua Fighter 2 and Fighting Vipers.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":853804800000,"platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":853804800000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Jan-21","y":1997,"m":1}]}
