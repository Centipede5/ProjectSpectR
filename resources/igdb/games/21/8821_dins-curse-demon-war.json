After the 4th Great War and necromancer Ciglio's death, the undead horde has been causing utter chaos, attacking everything that moves... even demons. Demonkind were quite happy when Serina, a human city, was overrun, but that was before thousands of human zombies poured into Kraval, slaughtering the huge demon city. Thus began the Demon War. Demons of all kinds are fighting back. They're hunting down and killing any undead they find. Oh, and they blame the humans for this entire mess. For spite, they razed Serina to the ground even though it was already deserted. \n \nAs a servant of the mighty Din, it's your responsibility to safeguard humans from danger. This was a hard task before. Do you have what it takes to save humankind from the Demon War?","collection":1194,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"game":8820,"games":[16468,36608,28010,1221,37088,13196,47823,12632,55289,59516],"tags":[1,17,268435468,1073741827],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cuorehsdv0ks9is52vqp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cuorehsdv0ks9is52vqp","width":558,"height":349},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gy3mgmam9gxxxrp7ac6z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gy3mgmam9gxxxrp7ac6z","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cpkphjkbotjocawafhdj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cpkphjkbotjocawafhdj","width":1600,"height":900},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pll8jtev8kukcurgk2ia.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pll8jtev8kukcurgk2ia","width":690,"height":388},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hwu7jeds6uyv0kkaagti.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hwu7jeds6uyv0kkaagti","width":690,"height":388}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"7owGtqGWQGs"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ninrkhwiaje9vwpk08z8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ninrkhwiaje9vwpk08z8","width":480,"height":686},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/217300\/Dins_Curse_Demon_War_DLC"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/dinscurse.wikia.com\/wiki\/Din%27s_Curse_Wiki"}]}
