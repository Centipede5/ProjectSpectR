The basic idea is to keep from running off the track. To get really big scores, though, players must drive locomotives into the passenger stations and pick up the waiting strap-hangers. There is even a bonus station that can only be reached during a limited time period. The faster the player gets to the special station, the more bonus points he or she collects (from 1000 to 5000).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":407548800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":407548800000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Dec-01","y":1982,"m":12}]}
