{"id":80821,"name":"The Mummy","slug":"the-mummy--1","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/the-mummy--1","created_at":1515348802775,"updated_at":1547365710798,"summary":"The Mummy is an action horror released as a tie-in for the 1999 Film of the same name. \nIt is a platform game for the PlayStation 1 game console and Microsoft Windows. The game is based mostly on the first film in the The Mummy series, taking place immediately after Evie resurrects Imhotep.","storyline":"Ardeth Bay addresses the player directly, saying that they have released an ancient evil fear for three millennia. The player then takes over as Rick O'Connell, who is situated in the catacombs of Hamunaptra and begins making his way through the tunnels, killing off thieves and taking any artifacts he can find. O\u2019Connell then operates the opening mechanisms for the tunnel doors, wherein he finds more artifacts and more thieves to be defeated, with a new menace coming in the form of scarabs, which are burned away with the torch that O\u2019Connell must light. Going further into the catacombs, O\u2019Connell states that he has a bad feeling and makes his way into a pit, at which point a dried, raspy inhuman voice shouts in ancient Egyptian and mummies erupt from the ground, which are more challenging to kill than the thieves. After dispatching the mummies and escaping the pit, O\u2019Connell goes in further to find more undead minions, these dressed in blue and gold trimmings and prove harder to kill than the mummies, requiring three strikes of the sword. These are defeated, however, and O\u2019Connell encounters more grave robbers before going further into the catacombs, finding a room filled with some treasure pieces which are taken, before moving on to reach another corridor filled with mummies. In time, O\u2019Connell reaches a sarcophagus that is opened, revealing a sword that shines blue. O\u2019Connell then leaves the chamber.","collection":4163,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49323,22425,62151,28540,28309,35994,24426,17929,103054,20342],"tags":[1,268435487,536871277,536871506,536871610,536871939,536872050,536874115,536875042,536875054,536875257,536875271,536875276,536875294,536875358,536875549,536875606,536875639,536875699,536875760,536875786,536875792,536876031,536876120,536876507,536876694,536876973,536878147,536881716,1073741826],"developers":[318],"publishers":[813,129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[365,594,698,1027,1138,3203,4130,4142,4345,4359,4364,4382,4446,4637,4694,4727,4787,4848,4874,4880,5119,5208,5595,5782,6061,7235,10804],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":974419200000,"platforms":[6,7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":974419200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Nov-17","y":2000,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":974419200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Nov-17","y":2000,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a9znxw6zqegfxtq5a23a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a9znxw6zqegfxtq5a23a","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dwiyalcmypmjk9goaa59.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dwiyalcmypmjk9goaa59","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hsb4ombwpciu3q07qdik.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hsb4ombwpciu3q07qdik","width":1000,"height":686},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dgkmi96yvwknfgee7tvc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dgkmi96yvwknfgee7tvc","width":980,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g0xmzdkv5a4n7n0dwy4x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g0xmzdkv5a4n7n0dwy4x","width":980,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gcwxpabydnmljyyxbehv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gcwxpabydnmljyyxbehv","width":780,"height":585},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/apwrsil2saz2wwar7upz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"apwrsil2saz2wwar7upz","width":800,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"USHJAEEiEK4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/la8nzpuhvpyn6xurfzl3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"la8nzpuhvpyn6xurfzl3","width":419,"height":500},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/mummy.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Mummy_(video_game)"}]}
