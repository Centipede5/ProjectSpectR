Was it Madam Rose in the carriage house with the poison? Monsieur Brunette in the trophy room with the horseshoe? Or was it Colonel Mustard in the library with his trusty revolver?\n\nPlay the home computer version of your favorite game of criminal detection just as you would on the board game, with friends.\n\nOr do what you can't do with the board version: play against the ultimate master of deduction, your own computer!\n\nYou can even do both: play with a mixture of human and computer-controlled opponents!\n\nEnjoy the enhancements the computer can bring to the game play, such as graphic animation and sound. Watch Miss Peach stroll into the gazebo and hear the twittering of songbirds.\n\nClue Master Detective is an enhanced version of the game Clue you know and love. The new game has even more to exercise your \"little grey cells\"- more suspects, more possible murder locations (indoors and outdoors), and more weapons- in fact, more mayhem!\n\nSo put away your violin, put on your deerstalker hat, fill your meerschaum pipe, and start sleuthing!\n\nWho will be the first to the solution? You, your friends, or the computer?\n\nThe game's afoot!","franchise":734,"franchises":[734],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,73075,18623,75065],"tags":[20,268435471,536871106,536872350,536872949,1073741827],"publishers":[7271],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[194,215,1438,1669,2037,3782],"themes":[20],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[13,16,15,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":25,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":15,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Clue: Master Detective","comment":"U.S. Title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/it89ite3rz2ihsfq52et.jpg","cloudinary_id":"it89ite3rz2ihsfq52et","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ltkxrwt43xgqdjqngegs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ltkxrwt43xgqdjqngegs","width":640,"height":812}}
