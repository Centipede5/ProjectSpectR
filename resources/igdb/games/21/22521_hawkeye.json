On each level, the eyes of the hawks in the status panel flash to indicate the direction to travel in to find a puzzle piece. Four pieces are needed to complete the level, but there were also other pickups such as ammo and energy. There were 12 levels to complete plus a hidden bonus level. \n \nThe player has a choice of four different weapons. The basic pistol had unlimited ammo but did little damage. The machine gun had a faster rate of fire, the laser did more damage and most powerful of all was the rocket launcher - but all three soon ran out of ammo. \n \nThe game features parallax scrolling backgrounds and large numbers of enemies (including large rhinos, triceratops and gorillas).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[68287,36950,28029,10039,27314,19174,64204,25300,76229,71455],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435464,536871882,536871971,536872961,536874947,536875484,536875572,536876028,536880227,1073741828],"developers":[13498],"publishers":[7146],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[970,1059,2049,4035,4572,4660,5116,9315],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[63,16,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p5bzkipohurf9m7wzhs8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p5bzkipohurf9m7wzhs8","width":1000,"height":957}}
