Using Bioware\u2019s Infinity engine and the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules, Black Isle Studios has expanded the northern reaches of Icewind Dale, providing a whole host of new challenges for your characters, along with new spells, items, and enemies.\nAlthough Heart of Winter is an expansion pack, be warned: The dangers you face are greater than the ones in Icewind Dale, and the threat to the whole of the Forgotten Realms is even greater. So prepare yourselves... the North is in need of heroes once again.","storyline":"The player's characters are greeted by a barbarian shaman, Hjollder, who reveals that he has visions of a great conflict and that the party is the key to stopping it. The party journeys to Lonelywood, where they discover that a great barbarian force is gathering nearby, threatening to destroy the Ten Towns. The force is led by Wylfdene, a great barbarian warlord who is the reincarnation of the dead queen Icasaracht and is now eager to strike the Ten Towns in the name of Tempos.","collection":178,"rating":80.02709294978119,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":80.02709294978119,"total_rating_count":20,"rating_count":20,"game":753,"games":[6,69782,753,22387,8802,876,55038,7615,14394,25921],"tags":[17,268435468,268435471,536871327,536871938,536872622,536872647,536873384,536875044,536875214,536875300,536875330,536875336,536875361,536875436,536875614,536875735,536875738,536875803,536876286,536876301,536876376,536876606,536876974,536877593,536878358,536880479,536880579,536880907,536881062,536881078,536881661,536882130,536882209,536882427,536882869,536883426,536886627,1073741827],"developers":[12],"publishers":[5],"game_engines":[28],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[415,1026,1710,1735,2472,4132,4302,4388,4418,4424,4449,4524,4702,4823,4826,4891,5374,5389,5464,5694,6062,6681,7446,9567,9667,9995,10150,10166,10749,11218,11297,11515,11957,12514,15715],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":1009756800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1009756800000,"human":"2001","y":2001,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"gRC4NIrKeT4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nd2xkj8gtpjxpydtfbfk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nd2xkj8gtpjxpydtfbfk","width":352,"height":426},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
