It was released in North America on February 26, 2008; in Australia on March 13, 2008; and in Europe on March 14, 2008.[3] \n \nThe game takes place in an alternate history in which Winston Churchill dies in 1931, eight years before the start of World War II, presenting the possibility of what could have happened to Europe, the United States, and the rest of the world without his leadership. The United Kingdom is subdued by Nazi Germany in 1940, and the rest of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East fall soon afterward. The United States, infected with anti-war sentiment, does not get involved overseas. The game takes place in the midst of the Greater German Reich's invasion and occupation of the East Coast of the United States in 1953.[4]","rating":26.1582748531245,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":41.75,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":33.95413742656226,"total_rating_count":11,"rating_count":5,"games":[619,617,5730,15536,3113,10591,571,36952,7435,6997],"tags":[1,17,22,268435461,536870931,536871365,536871470,536872205,536872352,536873455,536874947,536875067,536875137,536875242,536875257,536875303,536875358,536875483,536875491,536875572,536875624,536875682,536875693,536875802,536875807,536875815,536875822,536875885,536875887,536875904,536876168,536876221,536876262,536876499,536876572,536876762,536876853,536876899,536876911,536876932,536877217,536877286,536877440,536877501,536877532,536877540,536877547,536877820,536877928,536877957,536878010,536878084,536878317,536878577,536879707,536879983,536880294,536881514,536881529,536882513,536883995,536884422,536884507,1073741825],"developers":[948],"publishers":[115],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[19,453,558,1293,1440,2543,4035,4155,4225,4330,4345,4391,4446,4571,4579,4660,4712,4770,4781,4890,4895,4903,4910,4973,4975,4992,5256,5309,5350,5587,5660,5850,5941,5987,5999,6020,6305,6374,6528,6589,6620,6628,6635,6908,7016,7045,7098,7172,7405,7665,8795,9071,9382,10602,10617,11601,13083,13510,13595],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1203984000000,"platforms":[6,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1204243200000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Feb-29","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1203984000000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Feb-26","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1203984000000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Feb-26","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1203984000000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Feb-26","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1205366400000,"region":3,"human":"2008-Mar-13","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1205366400000,"region":3,"human":"2008-Mar-13","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1205366400000,"region":3,"human":"2008-Mar-13","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1205452800000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Mar-14","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1205452800000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Mar-14","y":2008,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bsrzxsoqwqh9km0liqdg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bsrzxsoqwqh9km0liqdg","width":480,"height":300}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/npoasd5cqpsreqqv0yi0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"npoasd5cqpsreqqv0yi0","width":256,"height":320},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4}}
