There is a slapstick comedy played out in black and white (complete with greyscale background) a cartoon with lots of Road Runnering and goofy facial expressions, a Wild West romp, Sci-Fi complete with aliens, and so on. After each platform level you will have to pass through a film scene - piloting a runaway mine-cart, navigating a scrolling shoot 'em up level, or similar.","popularity":1,"games":[19934,76731,22690,29173,55752,10039,55036,25311,1070,23345],"tags":[1,268435464,268435470,268435471,536872078,536872961,536874694,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1166,2049,3782],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,14,15],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[114,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oc1zfw1hmogsr0gukbb6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oc1zfw1hmogsr0gukbb6","width":640,"height":801}}
