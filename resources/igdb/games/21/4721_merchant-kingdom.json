An iPod connected to WiFi will restrict the growth of your Kingdom.\n\nEXPAND YOUR EMPIRE\nMerchant Kingdom starts you off as a simple merchant. Found your first settlements to produce basic goods in places you visit often, and then begin your rise to power. Your iPhone is the caravan you can use to buy commodities from traders, take them with you when you move around in real life, and sell at a profit.\n\nDIPLOMACY OR TYRANNY\nAs your trading empire expands, you desire more than just wealth \u2013 it\u2019s power you are longing for.

Upgrade your settlements whenever you can and choose from over 50 different buildings each with their own special abilities. Expand your caravan, as you get richer. Buy donkeys, settlers, horses, covered wagons, spies, thieves or one of the other units.\n\nSO MUCH TO DO, SO MUCH TO SEE\nExplore the world and discover over 40 different kinds of land types, from thick jungles, to deserts, to extinct volcanoes. On your travels, find rare commodities on your trips, then bring them home and sell them for a profit.
