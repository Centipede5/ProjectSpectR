Having eaten five Astropaths en-route to their new stations, Ork Warboss Skroll of the Evil Sunz clan is visited with (demented?) dreams of grandeur and conquest and launches a full-scale WAAAGH! on the Imperial colony of Volistad. With the might of the Bad Moons, the rapacious Evil Sunz and the Orkiest of all clans, the Goffs, at his disposal, Skroll quickly swept aside the defences of Volistad and took control of the planet. Leading an army of Ultramarines and Imperial guard, you must retake the system and cleanse it of the foul alien by completing missions and annihilating the Ork forces. Though the Emperor protects you, you must remain vigilant, for like all Orks, Skroll loves fitin\u2019, so he and his forces will take you to the last man and space marine. Only supreme tactics and precise execution will allow you to reclaim Volistad in the name of the Emperor.  \nSSI, the masterminds behind the Five Star General Series\u2019, bring their Midas touch to the Warhammer 40,000 world in the first ever video-game adaption of the EPIC table-top game. With over 85 unit types, this addition to the 40k franchise brings the vastness and depth of an EPIC-style battle to your PC, allowing you greater selection and customisation over your army. This, along with the multiple scenarios and battlefronts to fight from, will keep your strategic mind on edge for hours on end.","franchise":6,"franchises":[6],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[114415,13196,55038,30804,76410,23183,103303,107144,27209,26845],"tags":[17,18,268435472,536871106,536872272,536872616,1073741827],"developers":[10168],"publishers":[528],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[194,1360,1704],"themes":[17,18],"genres":[16],"first_release_date":880848000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":880848000000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Nov-30","y":1997,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fenxbqwcy0tv9qhdb409.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fenxbqwcy0tv9qhdb409","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cn9tvt1vcpoizs0xtzux.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cn9tvt1vcpoizs0xtzux","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sztdfscrvmfwj0vimwnp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sztdfscrvmfwj0vimwnp","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gptbgqn28opjlqijyirw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gptbgqn28opjlqijyirw","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dwhs2zfdrga0ox3d3uqh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dwhs2zfdrga0ox3d3uqh","width":600,"height":400}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"oJfV0Cpm0Dw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hj4darknjyycykhfbv9p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hj4darknjyycykhfbv9p","width":800,"height":951},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Final_Liberation:_Warhammer_Epic_40,000"},{"category":2,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Final_Liberation:_Warhammer_Epic_40,000"}]}
