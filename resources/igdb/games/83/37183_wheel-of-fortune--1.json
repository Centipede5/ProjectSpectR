{"id":37183,"name":"Wheel of Fortune","slug":"wheel-of-fortune--1","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/wheel-of-fortune--1","created_at":1497530815673,"updated_at":1516754888220,"summary":"If the wheel lands on any given amount, say $1000, and if you guess the correct consonant in any given puzzle in rounds 1-3, you win the $1000. Furthermore, if there is more than one consonant in the puzzle, your $1000 will be multiplied (e.g. four R's in a puzzle awards you with $4000). Each vowel you buy will cost you $250, however, you will not lose more than $250 even if there is more than one single vowel in a puzzle (e.g. if there are three A's in a puzzle you will not lose $750). But you will still lose $250 if you guess a vowel incorrectly. If the wheel lands on \"Bankrupt\" you will lose all your money (however, the money you carried over from round 1 will not be lost). If the wheel lands on \"Lose a Turn,\" the turn goes to the other contestant. If the wheel lands on \"Free Spin,\" you can spin again. This option is one way to keep you in the lead.","collection":3136,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[25217,11588,69474,48056,19083,25222,19082,6521,64476,48976],"tags":[268435465,268435482,536871684,536872617,536873513,536873787,536875051,536875054,536875075,536875140,536875291,536875356,536875632,536876419,536876664,536879692],"category":0,"keywords":[772,1705,2601,2875,4139,4142,4163,4228,4379,4444,4720,5507,5752,8780],"genres":[9,26],"first_release_date":594259200000,"platforms":[52,18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":594259200000,"region":2,"human":"1988-Oct-31","y":1988,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":612835200000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Jun-03","y":1989,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gcsx7msjiutq5qqc0ukp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gcsx7msjiutq5qqc0ukp","width":850,"height":1098}}
