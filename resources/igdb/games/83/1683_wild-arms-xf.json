Players are given control of a small squad of characters (six or less) and placed on a grid-based map resembling a geographical location (a swamp, a town, a river), upon which they fight battles to progress through the game. As with most T\/RPGs, positional advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and maneuvering by the inclusion of \"Formation Arts,\" which increase attack damage when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T\/RPGs whose battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. \"Combination Arts\" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will increase significantly. On the other hand, the enemy gets the same advantage.","collection":332,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1677,1817,22387,1223,1443,55092,1215,44,20331,1864],"tags":[17,268435468,268435471,536870921,536870984,536871138,536871148,536871208,536871213,536871327,536871390,536871433,536871470,536871506,536871851,536871938,536872098,536872425,536872509,536872647,536872835,536873154,536873247,536874094,536874694,536874745,536875046,536875057,536875184,536875185,536875196,536875197,536875199,536875271,536875300,536875307,536875309,536875314,536875356,536875523,536875525,536875621,536875755,536875764,536875796,536875930,536875934,536875944,536875952,536876232,536876240,536876281,536876471,536876499,536876503,536876847,536876875,536876974,536876986,536877216,536877554,536878078,536878133,536878335,536878441,536880469,536880563,536888348,536888363,536893226,536893296,536893297,1073741826],"developers":[2676],"publishers":[45,2187,445],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[9,72,226,236,296,301,415,478,521,558,594,939,1026,1186,1513,1597,1735,1923,2242,2335,3182,3782,3833,4134,4145,4272,4273,4284,4285,4287,4359,4388,4395,4397,4402,4444,4611,4613,4709,4843,4852,4884,5018,5022,5032,5040,5320,5328,5369,5559,5587,5591,5935,5963,6062,6074,6304,6642,7166,7221,7423,7529,9557,9651,17436,17451,22314,22384,22385],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":1186444800000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1186617600000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Aug-09","y":2007,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1205193600000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Mar-11","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1227830400000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Nov-28","y":2008,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1186444800000,"region":7,"human":"2007-Aug-07","y":2007,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30ef\u30a4\u30eb\u30c9\u30a2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ba \u30af\u30ed\u30b9\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zxodncvft6jatwriw1nv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zxodncvft6jatwriw1nv","width":640,"height":1035},"esrb":{"rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.wildarmsxf.com\/"}]}
