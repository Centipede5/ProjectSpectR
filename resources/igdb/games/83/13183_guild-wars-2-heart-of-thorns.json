Discover the secrets of the Maguuma Jungle, meet the new cultures and races who live there, and explore the vastly vertical maps as you progress your characters through this new region. \n \nThe jungle dragon, Mordremoth, is one of six Elder Dragons that threaten all life on Tyria with their corrupting influence and insatiable hunger for magic. Twisted by Mordremoth, the sylvari Scarlet Briar devastated the city of Lion's Arch and disrupted a magical ley line, awakening the dragon. Now it begins to send its minions, the Mordrem, forth to establish its hold on Tyria\u2014and to bring the sylvari race under its control. \n \nYou'll journey through four of the largest, most diverse and replayable maps ever built in the world of Guild Wars\u00ae; maps in Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns are designed as three-dimensional volumes rather than traditional flat planes. You'll have more to explore as you travel through the jungle biomes, from the canopy heights to the jungle floor and deep below into the jungle roots.","collection":172,"rating":80.14146844861929,"popularity":9.666666666666666,"aggregated_rating":85,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":82.57073422430965,"total_rating_count":17,"rating_count":15,"game":1183,"games":[19698,47823,54775,59427,23651,35450,64061,103303,68393,18398],"tags":[17,268435468,536871208,536871453,536871812,536871818,536872449,536875453,536876544,536877057,536878216,536881345,1073741826],"developers":[255],"publishers":[256],"game_engines":[17,454],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[296,541,900,906,1537,4541,5632,6145,7304,10433],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1445558400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1445558400000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Oct-23","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1445558400000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-23","y":2015,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"HoT"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oycwleirmxfrdb7cvmdj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oycwleirmxfrdb7cvmdj","width":1440,"height":810},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fsrtglrmuj7qdupbasvj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fsrtglrmuj7qdupbasvj","width":1440,"height":810},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nq7fxcfbkqv6ursg1caj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nq7fxcfbkqv6ursg1caj","width":1440,"height":810},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k3ziienfqegw6ioftcyq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k3ziienfqegw6ioftcyq","width":1440,"height":810},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/njzdi9vpw65o0lbfswkc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"njzdi9vpw65o0lbfswkc","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"GpeLj-fDK-4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/anlhng3hrzhyiqjt7r4z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"anlhng3hrzhyiqjt7r4z","width":527,"height":750},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game in which players perform quests while exploring the fantastical world of Tyria.
