Like previous installments in the series, the game is an arcade-style racer and focuses on wild, high-speed racing, rather than realistic physics and driving. The name is derived from a partnership between Rockstar and DUB Magazine, which features heavily in the game in the form of DUB-sponsored races and DUB-customized vehicles as prizes. \n \nPlayers race through open world recreations of San Diego, Atlanta, and Detroit listening to 98 licensed music tracks that include hip-hop, rock, and more.[citation needed] The game features a number of graphical views after the player crashes into certain objects, or travels across particular stretches of road. There is also the ability to customize a player's vehicle. Other than modifying the external looks, the vehicle's performance can also be improved (with the exception of all 'A' Class vehicles except motorcycles).","collection":697,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":75,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":3,"version_parent":5928,"version_title":"DUB Edition Remix","games":[23314,27378,90688,104983,81256,55192,103018,109292,82090,81249],"tags":[38,268435466],"category":0,"themes":[38],"genres":[10],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hgi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hgi","width":600,"height":800},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
