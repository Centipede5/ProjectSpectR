It was developed by Imagineer and was never released outside of Japan. \n \nMatsumoto Tooru no Kabushiki Hisshou Gaku (\"Matsumoto Tooru's Stock Success Knowledge\") is a stock exchange simulation developed and published by Imagineer. The goal of the game is to make 100 million yen (approximately $1.3mil) in the stock market in the span of a single year via a series of shrewd financial decisions and listening to advice about which way a certain type of stock might turn. \n \nThe game is fronted by Matsumoto Tooru, a nationally well-known financial adviser who is often considered to have an expansive knowledge of the Japanese stock market. The game also features the song \"The Entertainer\" by Scott Joplin. \n \nThough it focused on unusually complex subject matter for a video game, it sold enough copies to inspire a sequel that was released the following year.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55689,55590,18623,9199,44242,33603,11419,19847,36962],"tags":[268435469,268435471,536871906,536872060,536872211,536872840,536875356],"category":0,"keywords":[994,1148,1299,1928,4444],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":574646400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":574646400000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Mar-18","y":1988,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bweypvd59gra6elanij9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bweypvd59gra6elanij9","width":335,"height":439}}
