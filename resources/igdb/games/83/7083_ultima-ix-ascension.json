The game starts just after the end of Ultima VIII, in which the Avatar is transported to a Guardian-controlled Britannia. He arrives in Britannia on a mountain overlooking the Guardian's keep in Terfin. The Avatar is transported to Stonegate by Hawkwind the Seer (from Ultima IV), who informs him that great columns have appeared throughout the land, and their malignant influence has caused plagues, famine, and other natural disasters. Under their power, the people of Britannia have twisted the Virtues into mockeries of their true meaning. The Guardian is helped by Lord Blackthorn, who leads the Wyrmguards and forces the people to obey the Guardian.\n\nAs the quest progresses, the Avatar learns that the Guardian has stolen the Runes of the Virtues and twisted them into the glyphs that form the heart of each of the columns. Most of the game consists of traveling through the dungeons to recover the glyphs and visiting the Shrines of the Virtues to meditate and cleanse them. Eventually, it is revealed that the Guardian is nothing other than the dark half of the Avatar himself, and the only way to save Britannia is for the Avatar to ascend to a higher plane, taking the Guardian with him. The player is able to accomplish this via an Armageddon spell cast behind a Barrier of Life, which takes the Avatar and the Guardian to a higher plane out of Britannia.","collection":498,"franchise":68,"franchises":[68],"rating":79.621673108518,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":50,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":64.810836554259,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":6,"games":[472,1887,7346,3025,6,8456,2933,113,2368,59],"tags":[17,268435468,268435487,536870916,536870928,536870984,536871008,536871044,536871049,536871138,536871139,536871172,536871208,536871213,536871244,536871409,536871470,536871506,536871599,536871613,536871670,536871758,536871776,536871878,536871889,536871938,536872120,536872232,536872371,536872419,536872544,536872622,536872626,536872628,536872647,536872649,536872798,536872810,536872959,536872983,536873066,536873154,536873192,536873236,536873362,536873364,536873384,536873400,536873580,536874134,536874414,536875073,536875081,536875095,536875130,536875147,536875161,536875196,536875214,536875244,536875252,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875304,536875306,536875319,536875336,536875337,536875342,536875356,536875372,536875375,536875432,536875436,536875437,536875492,536875496,536875523,536875525,536875540,536875606,536875658,536875693,536875738,536875752,536875755,536875760,536875762,536875764,536875770,536875791,536875792,536875796,536875803,536875822,536876007,536876036,536876270,536876286,536876318,536876326,536876332,536876335,536876353,536876376,536876447,536876490,536876555,536876571,536876590,536876592,536876625,536876847,536876850,536876875,536876876,536877225,536877294,536877407,536877422,536877423,536877438,536877453,536877531,536877559,536877572,536877691,536877753,536877866,536877960,536877973,536877992,536878309,536878525,536878565,536879059,536879062,536879765,536879768,536879998,536880168,536880547,536880568,536880607,536880755,536881157,536882427,536883059,536884032,1073741826],"developers":[295],"publishers":[1],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[4,16,72,96,132,137,226,227,260,296,301,332,497,558,594,687,701,758,846,864,966,977,1026,1208,1320,1459,1507,1632,1710,1714,1716,1735,1737,1886,1898,2047,2071,2154,2242,2280,2324,2450,2452,2472,2488,2668,3222,3502,4161,4169,4183,4218,4235,4249,4284,4302,4332,4340,4353,4359,4363,4392,4394,4407,4424,4425,4430,4444,4460,4463,4520,4524,4525,4580,4584,4611,4613,4628,4694,4746,4781,4826,4840,4843,4848,4850,4852,4858,4879,4880,4884,4891,4910,5095,5124,5358,5374,5406,5414,5420,5423,5441,5464,5535,5578,5643,5659,5678,5680,5713,5935,5938,5963,5964,6313,6382,6495,6510,6511,6526,6541,6619,6647,6660,6779,6841,6954,7048,7061,7080,7397,7613,7653,8147,8150,8853,8856,9086,9256,9635,9656,9695,9843,10245,11515,12147,13120],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":943401600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":952560000000,"region":1,"human":"2000-Mar-09","y":2000,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":943401600000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Nov-24","y":1999,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ultima 9","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/blsuiwgyy5rbrxug09nu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"blsuiwgyy5rbrxug09nu","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/chlq6pit9zzbqvejerwi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"chlq6pit9zzbqvejerwi","width":1680,"height":1050}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"73hIkZYDIdk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vvi61nubdqkefbewrdjo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vvi61nubdqkefbewrdjo","width":600,"height":767},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20010322202309\/http:\/\/www.ultima-ascension.com\/main.html"}]}
