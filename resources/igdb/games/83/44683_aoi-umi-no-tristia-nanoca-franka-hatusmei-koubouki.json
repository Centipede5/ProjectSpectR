Tristia has been destroyed by monster attack, and players are given one year's time to restore things back to normal. You play as Nanoka Franka, a fourteen-year-old genius atelier. Your job is to research items and materials, find recipes, create new items, then sell your creations. The more items you sell, the closer Tristia gets to its former self. As you sell items, your popularity as a merchant, and your level in the game, rises, and you learn how to make new items. Story and character development play a big role in the title. Tristia is in competition with a number of rivals. Four rival girls, a companion robot and a companion dog, will appear in the game through events scenes. You'll be able to advance your relationship with these characters as you play, working to several possible endings.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12]}
