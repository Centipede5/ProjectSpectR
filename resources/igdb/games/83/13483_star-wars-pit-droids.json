At first, your droids start at the Transport Ship, ending at the final level, the Arena. In each puzzle, you need to get 48 droids into the portal; if you get only a few number of droids, you advance with only that number. With each puzzle you complete, you gain points. Each level you unlock, you get a humorous pit droids clip. The levels are located in Tatooine.\n\nThere are many different numbers of different types of obstacles and restriction. With different types of arrows, you can also make your own puzzles.\nDepending on the puzzles, there are certain factors:\nDifferent tools- wrench, ladder, gas tank, cases, or nothing. Sometimes there are obstacles which give your droids tools;\nDifferent colored heads, body, or same colored head and body. Sometimes there are painting obstacles that paint the body or head;\nSquare or Hexagonal grid;\nSpace between droids- if you have space, you can cross droid paths, with out it, they crash when approaching each other;\nCrashing or Falling- when approaching the end of the stage or an obstacle of some sort, they either crash or fall. On some puzzles, they just wait.\nYou must complete each puzzle with logic, problem solving, critical thinking, and visual thinking.\n\nOther game modes include creating a puzzle, or playing a scenario that has already been installed into the game.","storyline":"In the high-stakes sport of Podracing, urgent\nand determined pit droid mechanics can mean\nthe difference between victory and defeat\u2026\nwhen they stay out of trouble.\n\nThe Toydarian junk dealer Watto, eager to keep\nhis shop well stocked, is always on the lookout\nfor the next big deal.\n\nLooming over the desert planet Tatooine is\nthe largest shipment of pit droids Watto has\never purchased, threatening to overrun\nall of Mos Espa unless someone gets\nthem under control\u2026","collection":2172,"franchise":1,"franchises":[1],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[17130,34823,1877,68287,13200,36950,55038,33726,25300,23781],"tags":[18,34,268435465,536871446,536871487,536871878,536871882,536872552,536875054,536875294,536876694,536879752,1073741827],"publishers":[7044],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[534,575,966,970,1640,4142,4382,5782,8840],"themes":[18,34],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":937612800000,"platforms":[6,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":937612800000,"human":"1999-Sep-18","y":1999,"m":9},{"category":2,"platform":39,"date":1356912000000,"human":"2012","y":2012,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n6cjsjw8vhusgxnwllhw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n6cjsjw8vhusgxnwllhw","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mrs3hcbouwjh3muvg7nb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mrs3hcbouwjh3muvg7nb","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w55hinnao5avw3d6gphk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w55hinnao5avw3d6gphk","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/md0babvzc0y4t2hooozw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"md0babvzc0y4t2hooozw","width":1024,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"9wTTJ7doULM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kjybenbhhfro6pipqlqg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kjybenbhhfro6pipqlqg","width":384,"height":464}}
