Guild Wars 2 was released on August 28, 2012. It has been in development since 2006. \n \nMany features have integrated into the game which align it with traditional MMORPGs, such as a persistent world and a level cap of 80, but the game has been described by ArenaNet as having non-traditional elements as well, because \"it doesn\u2019t make you spend hours preparing to have fun rather than just having fun.\"","storyline":"Your story begins the moment you bring your character to life. When you create your character, you\u2019ll choose from a range of biographical options that reflect their personality, history, and how they see the world. This biography will set you down a story path, which offers you choices to make. Your decisions will take the story in different directions. \n \nThe race you choose for your character determines which of the five massive home cities they\u2019ll begin their story in. Your personal story will guide you through private, instanced chapters that explore your character\u2019s life and adventures as they shape their own destiny. If you need a little help, you can always invite friends along to experience your personal story with you. As \u201cguest stars,\u201d these players can help you, but it\u2019s still your story, and key decisions are yours to make \n \nGuild Wars 2 provides players both the social, fully interactive feeling of a multiplayer game as well as the customized, choice-based story of a role-playing game. Whether the stakes are epic or personal, we want players to experience their own story within Tyria. \n \nWe\u2019ve brought to life a massive world of events, storylines, and characters\u2014all we need is you.","collection":172,"rating":79.9979279923388,"popularity":6.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":89.75,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":84.87396399616941,"total_rating_count":131,"rating_count":120,"games":[19698,47823,54775,59427,23651,35450,64061,103303,76888,18398],"tags":[17,268435468,536871208,536871812,536872983,536875270,536875278,536875735,536875738,536875784,536876007,536876942,536885407,536885408,536885409,1073741826],"developers":[255],"publishers":[256],"game_engines":[17,454],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[296,900,2071,4358,4366,4823,4826,4872,5095,6030,14495,14496,14497],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"expansions":[13183,53387],"first_release_date":1345248000000,"pulse_count":64,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1345248000000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Aug-18","y":2012,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1345248000000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Aug-18","y":2012,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1400112000000,"region":6,"human":"2014-May-15","y":2014,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"GW2","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y89te8oduvhyznbyryec.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y89te8oduvhyznbyryec","width":1200,"height":675},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/niey3bdkjn0kc2p2ngee.jpg","cloudinary_id":"niey3bdkjn0kc2p2ngee","width":1200,"height":675},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oilcswzusolurip4nski.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oilcswzusolurip4nski","width":1200,"height":750},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zv5h9u0fzpszlxdt3ems.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zv5h9u0fzpszlxdt3ems","width":1200,"height":675},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p9grk8yasb87w7jdis10.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p9grk8yasb87w7jdis10","width":1200,"height":675}],"videos":[{"name":"Commando Class Trailer (April Fools)","video_id":"KR2Esy83MQ0"},{"name":"Races Trailer","video_id":"YEdr8HHJ-zU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q3bhlxeq4x1f92xanjvg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q3bhlxeq4x1f92xanjvg","width":791,"height":1024},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game in which players perform quests while exploring the fantastical world of Tyria.
