The world's magical power is called Force, which manifests in various people as control over an element or aspect of the physical laws. In ancient times, after a war sparked when Huma attempted to enslave Gajuma, both races joined forces to found the kingdom of Karegia. An unspecified time before the events of the game, Geyorkias, the ruler of a spirit race called the Sacred Beasts, sought to destroy the Huma as their dark emotions were fueling a primordial destructive force known as Yuris: the other Sacred Beasts put a stop to Geyorkias' plan by sealing him away, then acting to nullify Yuris' threat. The story opens with the death of Karegia's king, Ladras Lindblum, poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan: during his final moments, he releases his power into the world, causing many humans to become possessed by Force, including Veigue, Annie and Tytree. As the king has failed to name a successor, Karegia enters an interregnum at his death.","collection":269,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55092,27209,81249,12632,28010,11169,27092,26765,25921,47823],"tags":[1,17,268435468,536870988,536870990,536871086,536871208,536871257,536871390,536871433,536871938,1073741826],"developers":[826],"publishers":[263,3958],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[76,78,174,296,345,478,521,1026],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1103155200000,"platforms":[38,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1103155200000,"region":5,"human":"2004-Dec-16","y":2004,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1205884800000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Mar-19","y":2008,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30c6\u30a4\u30eb\u30ba \u30aa\u30d6 \u30ea\u30d0\u30fc\u30b9","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"\u91cd\u751f\u4f20\u8bf4","comment":"Chinese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xgb1vjsqjwlqgjnvivht.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xgb1vjsqjwlqgjnvivht","width":603,"height":776},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tales_of_Rebirth"}]}
