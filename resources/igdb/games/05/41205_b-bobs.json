This game has a nice idea, you have to bump boulders in from below with your helmet on your head, but the gameplay is unfair, in some situations it's just luck, a good idea changed into a frustrating game. Then on the other hand it is easily possible to leech endless score in the bonus round. Not good. Move joystick left\/right on title screen to toggle 1\/2 player mode.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":644198400000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":644198400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jun-01","y":1990,"m":6}]}
