Each level also requires a different spell to find the key, and every key found gives him a finite amount of times he could cast the spell. Some spells cast projectiles, which could either kill or freeze enemies, while some would teleport Wilfrid around, either by turning him to a non-corporeal \"shadow\" or by instantly moving him to his starting point.","collection":2708,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"game":25797,"games":[55752,36926,47823,12632,19289,36534,27209,11169,55092,11567],"tags":[1,17,268435464,268435487,536871138,536871208,536871878,536871938,536871939,536872961,536873064,536875054,536875056,536875073,536875229,536875304,536875639,536875870,536876120,536876578,1073741828],"developers":[11544],"publishers":[1],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[226,296,966,1026,1027,2049,2152,4142,4144,4161,4317,4392,4727,4958,5208,5666],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":525916800000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":525916800000,"region":2,"human":"1986-Sep-01","y":1986,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cw3dlsbtkgbmqfimzzhi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cw3dlsbtkgbmqfimzzhi","width":1000,"height":997}}
