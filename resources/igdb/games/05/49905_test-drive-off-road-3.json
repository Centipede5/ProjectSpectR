Those are the vehicles included in TEST DRIVE OFF ROAD. You can choose from four different vehicles: a Hummer, Land Rover Defender 90, Jeep Wrangler and Chevrolet K-1500 Z71. In addition to the four starting vehicles six more become available with extended play and include a monster truck, dune buggy, stock car, hot rod, Mini Cooper, and an off-road beetle. When you are ready to race there is a Mixed League and Class League to choose from. Mixed League is open to any vehicle and Class League restricts the entries to vehicles of a particular type. While you are racing the 12 tracks offer three different surfaces including dirt, snow, and rocks. Try to master the elements and go where other cars can't with TEST DRIVE OFF ROAD.","collection":588,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[27378,27553,38851,55192,96,49621,46041,94,40470,80479],"tags":[268435466,536872695,536875069,536875257,536875271,536875364,536876314,536876419,536876484,536876698,536877744,536878319,536878376,536881476],"category":0,"keywords":[1783,4157,4345,4359,4452,5402,5507,5572,5786,6832,7407,7464,10564],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":944006400000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":944006400000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Dec-01","y":1999,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"4x4 World Trophy","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vmqazwk0rf6a7hfzbsoc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vmqazwk0rf6a7hfzbsoc","width":543,"height":644},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
