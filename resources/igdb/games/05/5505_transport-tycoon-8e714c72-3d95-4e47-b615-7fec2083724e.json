Developed by Chris Sawyer, and coded in X86 Assembly language, it was among the first in the relatively new 'tycoon' genre of games - simulations of business empires that the player founded, grew and took full control of.\nTransport Tycoon saw the player running their transport empire from 1930 to 2030, with rail, road, sea and air transport available to help the player's expansion of their business. New technologies are introduced to the player at historically accurate times, and players could see first-hand how advancements changed the way their businesses were run.\nTransport Tycoon Deluxe was released in 1995, and featured new varieties of landscape and weather, new scenarios, more vehicles and allowed the player to run their company all the way from the year 1950 up to the year 2050.\nChris then moved on to the Rollercoaster Tycoon series of games, released between 1999 and 2006.\n2013 marks the return of the classic Transport Tycoon franchise, and this new release surely marks the beginning of a new era!","collection":809,"franchise":1218,"franchises":[1218],"rating":75.4098360655738,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":75.4098360655738,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":3,"version_parent":5504,"games":[44242,87210,101573,106008,9910,82117,79134,28277,27744,109464],"tags":[28,268435469,1073741827],"developers":[2447],"publishers":[2446],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[28],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":1388448000000,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":39,"date":1388448000000,"human":"2013","y":2013,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":34,"date":1388448000000,"human":"2013","y":2013,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"TT"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cw4zkyuafrdajxqnkmth.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cw4zkyuafrdajxqnkmth","width":716,"height":537},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nwihfwy102nvcmua9bjg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nwihfwy102nvcmua9bjg","width":716,"height":537},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ptpvv90hnfu4ytz7p1ji.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ptpvv90hnfu4ytz7p1ji","width":716,"height":537},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g1vapdeckpfdjkdy1y2a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g1vapdeckpfdjkdy1y2a","width":716,"height":537},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e3fsi3luvaxsjxotvo3c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e3fsi3luvaxsjxotvo3c","width":716,"height":537}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"pMcqnNHueHc"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"tgp9Gw972Sc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d3guslzuqv4j3xff1o4d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d3guslzuqv4j3xff1o4d","width":192,"height":192},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.transporttycoon.com\/"}]}
