As a Japanese adventure game, players must select through menus of dialogue in order to determine her future. Friends (and sometimes rivals) of Erika give her advice on what to do next. \n \nThere are six songs in the game; all of them belonging to the J-pop genre. Erika must master them all in order to become the greatest idol in all of Japan. Lyrics are not sung by a voice actor; they are shown on the bottom of the screen instead.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55803,29730,13189,25222,41895,22482,70861,22425,61267,11296],"tags":[268435487,536870990,536871939,1073741829],"developers":[716],"publishers":[3904],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,1027],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":621734400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":621734400000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Sep-14","y":1989,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u516b\u72ac\u4f1d","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gsrwjnmh2aadz7k9l4pr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gsrwjnmh2aadz7k9l4pr","width":220,"height":319}}
