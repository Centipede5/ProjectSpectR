Unlike the original, this game uses scaling-based third-person graphics like Pole Position and the like, and focuses specifically on F-1 racing. \n \nIn addition to the Free Run and Grand Prix modes, there is a two player Battle Mode. The difficulty level can be set, and in Free Run a number of settings (such as the number of laps) is variable. Cars are custom made; the body and color of the car, the engine, the tires, the suspension, the brakes, the gear, and the wings can be all modified.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,58785,51052,47519,12739,40470,47304,46922,41804,34753],"tags":[1,268435466,536874337,536875069,536875117],"category":0,"keywords":[3425,4157,4205],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":570672000000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":570672000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Feb-01","y":1988,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gsmpyvottg6rvityykxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gsmpyvottg6rvityykxl","width":602,"height":842}}
