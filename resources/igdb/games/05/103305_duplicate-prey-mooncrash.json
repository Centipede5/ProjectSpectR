With changing environments as dangerous as they are dynamic, the Mooncrash campaign for Prey will offer a fun challenge to test even the most skilled players. \n \nTranStar\u2019s secret moon base stopped transmitting shortly after the events of Prey. Now Peter, a hacker stationed aboard a spy satellite tasked with intercepting TranStar communications, must find out why. Trapped and under a ruthless contract with KASMA Corp, Peter\u2019s only hope of ever seeing his family again is uncovering the moon base\u2019s lost secrets. \n \nPrey: Mooncrash also includes the upcoming Typhon Hunter multiplayer update, announced tonight, a tense game of hide and seek between a single survivor and five other players who stalk, hunt, and hide in plain sight as mimics. The Typhon Hunter update is expected to release later this summer on all platforms.","popularity":1,"category":0,"keywords":[1094]}
