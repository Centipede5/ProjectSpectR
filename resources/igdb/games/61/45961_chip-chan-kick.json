There are two playable characters, both of which are little girls. There is no difference between them gameplay-wise: both use a large blob-like animal to hit enemies from a short distance in a yo-yo-like fashion. It is possible to choose one of them as a single player, or to use them both cooperatively in the two-player mode.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26391,6985,37088,26848,19289,63138,55752,41064,16468,37094],"tags":[17,22,268435464,536872961,536875067],"category":0,"keywords":[2049,4155],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[8],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b29qxxwwzrcvwbkzkt83.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b29qxxwwzrcvwbkzkt83","width":600,"height":592}}
