The game also features cheerleaders, coaches, commentary by an insane play-by-play announcer called \"Manic Max\", and a crowd of fans who cheer or jeer at the players, based on their performance (the leader of whom is \"Joe Six-Pack\").","collection":4564,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[18681,54662,15851,57738,701,15041,79516,28862,14713,36035],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536870939,536875075,536877551,536878093],"category":0,"keywords":[26,27,4163,6639,7181],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tk2y5arixkyrvmchskoj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tk2y5arixkyrvmchskoj","width":193,"height":320}}
