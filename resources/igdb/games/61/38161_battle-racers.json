The game takes after Super Mario Kart in its presentation and use of power-ups to get the edge in races. It also uses a similar zoomed-out view of the track for the second player's window for the game's single-player mode. \n \nPlayers select from four Grand Prix cups: each cup has one more track than the one before, starting with four. The final cup is locked until the others have been beaten.","collection":3072,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[38328,39946,665,42353,42277,3772,55752,43859,44432,26709],"tags":[268435466,536870937,536871208,536871987,536872399,536872656,536874337,536874539,536875069,536875073,536875117,536875122,536875128,536875715,536875955,536876698,536876788,536877677],"category":0,"keywords":[25,296,1075,1487,1744,3425,3627,4157,4161,4205,4210,4216,4803,5043,5786,5876,6765],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":798076800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":798076800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Apr-17","y":1995,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oxhffznqfauqfpsozfko.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oxhffznqfauqfpsozfko","width":273,"height":498}}
