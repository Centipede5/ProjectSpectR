This adventure game is based on the rules and background created by TSR, Inc. and a storyline created especially for this game. THE CURSE OF THE AZURE BONDS adventure begins in the frontier city of Tilverton on the border between the great kingdom of Cormyr and the scattered settlements of the Dalelands. The characters begin as experienced adventurers who have been ambushed, captured, and cursed with five magical bonds. \n \nEach bond is an azure-blue symbol imprinted just under the skin of each character's swordarm. These bonds have dangerous magical powers that can take control of the characters' actions. The characters' quest in Curse of the Azure Bonds is to search the Realms for the source of the bonds and rid themselves of the bonds' terrible curse.","storyline":"Curse of the Azure Bonds takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting. The adventure begins in the city of Tilverton, a relatively small town that nonetheless contains all the essential shops and services to equip the party. Although the characters begin the game with no equipment, each character does receive money at the start of the game with which to buy weapons and armor. Outside the city of Tilverton, the characters may explore underground caverns, sewers, and outside in the wilds. Other locations include the Elven Forest, Zhentil Keep, the temple at Yulash, and the citadel at Hap, though these locations cannot be freely explored by the party. Instead, the player can use a menu to select places within the locations to visit. Yulash is under siege by marauders, and characters entering the town are also in danger from crumbling walls and sinkholes.","collection":1837,"franchise":43,"franchises":[43,1139,731],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[26766,23198,18822,1593,6,12760,12761,36926,12113,11214],"tags":[17,22,268435468,268435487,536870984,536871063,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871237,536871254,536871259,536871260,536871504,536871648,536871938,536872425,536872647,536872835,536872978,536873364,536873473,536874134,536875075,536875160,536875196,536875243,536875306,536875356,536875361,536875380,536875455,536875571,536875735,536875738,536875793,536875803,536875868,536875891,536876301,536876900,536877236,536877554,536877829,536878358,536878375,536878529,536879130,536879783,536880562,536884867,536885418,536886005,536886163,536886164,1073741827,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[528],"publishers":[528],"game_engines":[165],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[72,151,226,227,296,325,342,347,348,592,736,1026,1513,1735,1923,2066,2452,2561,3222,4163,4248,4284,4331,4394,4444,4449,4468,4543,4659,4823,4826,4881,4891,4956,4979,5389,5988,6324,6642,6917,7446,7463,7617,8218,8871,9650,13955,14506,15093,15251,15252],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[63,14,13,16,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":662601600000,"region":2,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":694137600000,"region":2,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":662601600000,"region":2,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Curse of the Azure Bonds","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zsw8txk6ubjwdfpiv1eo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zsw8txk6ubjwdfpiv1eo","width":320,"height":256}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"0twOVl49Vg0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t9bbkwevt4ykbj51zxeu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t9bbkwevt4ykbj51zxeu","width":1140,"height":1729},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Curse_of_the_Azure_Bonds"}]}
