The game is based on the arcade shooter of the same name released by Taito\/Toaplan in 1987 (also known as Twin Hawk). The players takes control of a World War II plane and fights his way through a vast array of enemy air defenses such as tanks, submarines and battle ships (curiously, there aren't any enemy planes in the game). Our fighter plane can use a classic Vulcan gun and a special, but limited, bomb attack. The latter calls a formation of friendly planes that will shoot at will until they eventually get hit. Pressing the bomb button twice triggers a powerful smart-bomb and wipes out most of the enemies on screen. A standard power-up system upgrades the plane throughout the game - destroying tiny truck usually frees up power-icons. Some, stamped with a large character P on them, upgrade the plane's main gun up to four times. Others give away extra bombs or rare extra lives.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":683164800000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":683164800000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Aug-26","y":1991,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z5guiiuke9jsktlcwipc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z5guiiuke9jsktlcwipc","width":1414,"height":1402}}
