While previous YO-KAI WATCH games focused on turn-based battles, YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS drops you into real-time skirmishes, in the first ever action RPG for the series. \n \nDuring these battles, you directly control your Yo-kai as you strategise with different skills and equipment to defeat huge bosses. By taking on various fast-paced missions, players will embark on a journey to meet, befriend and battle more than 400 new and returning Yo-kai. \n \nEach of the two versions of the game \u2013 YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS: White Dog Squad or YO-KAI WATCH BLASTERS: Red Cat Corps \u2013 contains different Yo-kai, missions and bosses. By trading between the two, you can collect all the Yo-kai! \n \nBy linking save data from YO-KAI WATCH 2: Bony Spirits, YO-KAI WATCH 2: Fleshy Souls or YO-KAI WATCH 2: Psychic Specters, you can get one of three special Yo-kai to take into battle.\"","collection":2858,"franchise":961,"franchises":[961],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103282,54775,26879,25877,107144,81249,19698,11659,102873,13196],"tags":[17,268435468,536872822,1073741826,1073741827],"developers":[837],"publishers":[4034,2850,837],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[1910],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1436572800000,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1536278400000,"region":1,"human":"2018-Sep-07","y":2018,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1536278400000,"region":2,"human":"2018-Sep-07","y":2018,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1436572800000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Jul-11","y":2015,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Yo-Kai Watch Busters: White Dog Corps","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Y\u014dkai Wotchi Basut\u0101zu: Shiroi Inu-tai","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"\u5996\u602a\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c1\u30d0\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba \u767d\u72ac\u968a","comment":"Japanese title"}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"55E_3aP9C2g"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Y4Mn9Jt7zxw"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"X2ksFYz5MIQ"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"9Jhvb4F4ric"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vhpbsglphjzfvthvcpfj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vhpbsglphjzfvthvcpfj","width":287,"height":255},"esrb":{"rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/yokaiwatch.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yo-kai_Watch_Busters"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.youkai-watch.jp\/busters\/"}]}
