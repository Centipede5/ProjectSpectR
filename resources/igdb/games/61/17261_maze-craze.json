Each player controls a cop that starts on the left, and the first player to make it out the exit on the right wins. The game also includes of variety of options. The maze can be completely visible, completely invisible, or have just a few parts invisible. With invisible mazes you can optionally have the computer provide a sneak peak at the complete maze periodically. To make your task more challenging, one to five robbers may also be placed in the maze. If you are caught by one of the robbers, you will momentarily be stunned giving your opponent an advantage. You can also give your cop the ability to set up a blockade to confuse your opponent. This will look like a regular wall, however you can walk straight through it. The games speed can also be adjusted, from calculatingly slow to extremely fast.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[90108,76253,95776,91140,109577,80174,25646,103298,109458,87507],"tags":[1,268435465,1073741827],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":347068800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":347068800000,"region":2,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"elWSyuQ8fDg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bgn2kgcclafmaiq5w4xl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bgn2kgcclafmaiq5w4xl","width":640,"height":872}}
