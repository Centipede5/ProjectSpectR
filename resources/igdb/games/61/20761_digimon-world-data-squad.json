{"id":20761,"name":"Digimon World Data Squad","slug":"digimon-world-data-squad","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/digimon-world-data-squad","created_at":1468944646264,"updated_at":1542420439614,"summary":"The game is set in the Digimon Data Squad universe, and revolves around the Seven Great Demon Lords. In this game the player will be able to control the four main Savers characters, Marcus Damon, Thomas H. Norstein, Yoshino \"Yoshi\" Fujieda, and Keenan Crier along with their respective Digimon partners. The graphics for this game are cel-shaded and the battle system is similar to the Battle Terminal (a Japanese-only arcade game). The game is classified as a \"special genre\", called a \"Dramatic\/Innovative RPG\", which means that the Digimon partners are affected by how you, the player, treat them. The way your Digimon evolves will be similar to Digimon World; the Digimon will be affected by how you take care of it and, depending on that, will digivolve into different types of Digimon. In Digimon World Data Squad, a new type of digivolution method is used, called the Galactica Evolution System: this will determine what Digimon your partner will evolve into. There will also be new, original characters for this game, meaning that these characters are exclusive to Digimon World Data Squad, and will not appear in any other Digimon Data Squad media.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":0,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":0,"total_rating_count":2,"category":0,"first_release_date":1192665600000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1192665600000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Oct-18","y":2007,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zfmu6bxmvya1zkqtqxgi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zfmu6bxmvya1zkqtqxgi","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j2zqy4kfmobiihtdtxhh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j2zqy4kfmobiihtdtxhh","width":1527,"height":2156}}
