{"id":50261,"name":"Angband","slug":"angband","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/angband","created_at":1500039624851,"updated_at":1534661499277,"summary":"Angband is an open-source reogulike, the goal of which is to survive 100 floor levels of the fortress Angband in order to defeat Morgoth. \n \nThe player begins in a town where they can buy equipment before beginning the descent. Once in the maze-like fortress, the player encounters traps, monsters, equipment, and hidden doors. With the help of found objects and enchantments, the player's attack and defense power increases, and can even neutralize specific attacks. \n \nAngband gameplay emphasises combat and careful resource management. The player has finite health points, and death is final. Although Angband records the player's progress to a save file, it does not allow one to resume a saved game in which the player character has already died. If the player overcomes Morgoth on the 100th floor, the game continues, and the player may continue descending to further floors. The levels are procedurally generated, allowing for a unique game in every play.","popularity":1,"games":[82857,70707,69505,82761,82842,82750,82687,57296,82941,82917],"tags":[536871938,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[72,416,578,603,604,720,1026,1318],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[14,13,16,3],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":3,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nh79pvp7wpysgetuisl6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nh79pvp7wpysgetuisl6","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kuxy1hu01dd30t6ustfs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kuxy1hu01dd30t6ustfs","width":640,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o8tuhk3dlenssa6gzhe8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o8tuhk3dlenssa6gzhe8","width":1281,"height":604}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dtm7xd4sghvlgsn8um1u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dtm7xd4sghvlgsn8um1u","width":1038,"height":576},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/angband"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Angband_(video_game)"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/rephial.org\/"}]}
