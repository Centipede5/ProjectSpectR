He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed to select a starter Pok\u00e9mon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pok\u00e9mon which is strongest against the player's starting Pok\u00e9mon. He will then challenge the player to a Pok\u00e9mon battle with their newly obtained Pok\u00e9mon, and will continue to battle the player at certain points throughout the games. \nWhile visiting the region's cities, the player will encounter special establishments called Gyms.
