Players will enjoy the game while developing the powers of thinking, utilising their existing knowledge and experience. This game transforms basic curiosity into powerful thinking. \n \nMinDStorm, from developer ASK Co. Ltd., takes brain exercise software to a new level and offers a whole raft of exciting new games, features and challenges all designed specifically to stimulate and improve the player's brain functions and most importantly, be fun to play in their own right. \n \nTransform gaming curiosity into powerful thinking with MinDStorm. The game features ten distinct types of challenge for players, all of which are simple to pick up and play using the Nintendo DS stylus, touch screen and microphone. Each of MinDStorm's challenges is designed to focus on enhancing the player's reason, endurance, analysis, intuition or observation. Regardless of the type of game chosen, extended play results in improved overall brain function and enhanced memory. \n \nA first for the brain training genre, MinDStorm throws additional challenges and problems into the mix. Players are rewarded with ever more complex riddles to solve as they do well in the main training mode. General knowledge and geography-based challenges are also included to accompany the more abstract trials such as sliding picture puzzles, mazes to navigate with the stylus and spot the difference games. \n \nFurther innovation is found in the way the game will adapt the tasks it asks players to perform according to the local environment it is being played in. When playing on a bumpy car or train ride for instance, MinDStorm will omit the tasks that require precise stylus action. When playing in public the game will spare players the need to vocalize into the Nintendo DS microphone. With its many innovative and exciting challenges and features, MinDStorm offers arguably the most thorough workout yet seen in a brain training title.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1189382400000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1189382400000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Sep-10","y":2007,"m":9}]}
