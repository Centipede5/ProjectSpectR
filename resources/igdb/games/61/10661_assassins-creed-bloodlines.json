{"id":10661,"name":"Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines","slug":"assassins-creed-bloodlines","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/assassins-creed-bloodlines","created_at":1432643569655,"updated_at":1547329016417,"summary":"Assassin\u2019s Creed: Bloodlines on PSP is the first Assassin\u2019s Creed game on the PSP system. It follows the story of Altair right after the events of Assassin\u2019s Creed\u2122 as Altair tracks down the last Templars who fled the Holy Land and retreated to the Island of Cyprus.","storyline":"Beginning shortly after the end of the first game, Alta\u00efr Ibn-La'Ahad learns of a plan of the remaining Templars to escape to Cyprus, and so infiltrates one of their strongholds in Acre to stop them from doing so. Although he does not succeed in this regard, he does defeat and capture Maria Thorpe, who attempted to avenge her former master, Robert de Sabl\u00e9, who died at Alta\u00efr's hands. Managing to charter a ship, Alta\u00efr also heads to Cyprus in pursuit of the apple, with Maria in tow. \n \nOnce there, he learns of the presence of Armand Bouchart, who has succeeded Robert de Sabl\u00e9, as Grand Master of the Templar Order. Alta\u00efr also learns, and gains the assistance, of a resistance movement in the city opposed to the presence of the Templars, who, after purchasing the island from King Richard, have formed a repressive government to control the land and its people. He also learns of a Templar \"archive\", a trove of Templar knowledge and artifacts, hidden somewhere on the island. True to the way of the Assassins, Alta\u00efr makes to both locate the archive and free Cyprus from Bouchart's grip, firstly by slaying his underlings: Frederick \"the Red\"; Moloch \"the Bull\"; Shalim and Shahar \"the Twins\", and the Dark Oracle \"the Witch,\" eventually confronting and defeating Bouchart at the archive, whose contents have been evacuated and relocated by Templar soldiers. Following Bouchart's death, the archive begins to collapse, but Alta\u00efr manages to escape. \n \nThe game also details the relationship between Alta\u00efr and Maria. At first, Maria is hostile and sarcastic towards Alta\u00efr (in her own words, \"the man who spared my neck but ruined my life\"), but as the story develops, she gradually warms to the assassin who, despite her repeated escape attempts, repeatedly rescues her from harm and does not punish her. Eventually, she decides to assist Alta\u00efr by killing a Templar mole in the resistance when he attempts to kill Alta\u00efr and confronting Bouchart alongside him in the final battle, at this point having fallen in love with the assassin. After their escape from the Templar archive, the two of them decide to head east towards India.","collection":18,"franchise":571,"franchises":[571],"hypes":1,"rating":58.9446783751061,"popularity":3.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":45,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":51.97233918755305,"total_rating_count":27,"rating_count":24,"games":[128,1266,113,127,537,8263,2933,5606,19561,3025],"tags":[1,18,22,23,38,268435487,536870934,536871041,536871044,536871063,536871082,536871302,536871506,536871535,536871882,536871893,536871945,536872315,536872371,536872509,536873192,536873674,536875046,536875073,536875081,536875095,536875162,536875229,536875401,536875437,536875488,536875525,536875623,536875693,536875769,536875778,536875792,536875819,536875912,536876007,536876008,536876054,536876062,536876212,536876220,536876235,536876287,536876330,536876755,536877161,536877294,536877566,536878257,536878309,536878507,536878523,536878531,536879064,536879069,536879078,536879212,536879739,536879741,536879744,536879745,536880068,536880430,536882210,536883865,536891152,536893166,536893167,1073741826],"developers":[62,38],"publishers":[104],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[22,129,132,151,170,390,594,623,970,981,1033,1403,1459,1597,2280,2762,4134,4161,4169,4183,4250,4317,4489,4525,4576,4613,4711,4781,4857,4866,4880,4907,5000,5095,5096,5142,5150,5300,5308,5323,5375,5418,5843,6249,6382,6654,7345,7397,7595,7611,7619,8152,8157,8166,8300,8827,8829,8832,8833,9156,9518,11298,12953,20240,22254,22255],"themes":[1,18,22,23,38],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1258416000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1258416000000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-17","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1258675200000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-20","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1258416000000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Nov-17","y":2009,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"AC: BloodlinesAssassins Creed: Bloodlines","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qsmarnpsqchtwv7gl7oo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qsmarnpsqchtwv7gl7oo","width":480,"height":228},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oy3nx5wnlrqf1i0nhm45.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oy3nx5wnlrqf1i0nhm45","width":1440,"height":814},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t0rzjxtkyulekyc57rdq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t0rzjxtkyulekyc57rdq","width":480,"height":272},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kberalhlpdd3d1eoj91q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kberalhlpdd3d1eoj91q","width":431,"height":404},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w2wtq4pmfrap4vvielzo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w2wtq4pmfrap4vvielzo","width":550,"height":310}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"jCPUd9vMmkc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vxx4efzfleb7gevtk3ky.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vxx4efzfleb7gevtk3ky","width":256,"height":440},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assassin%27s_Creed:_Bloodlines"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/assassinscreed.wikia.com\/wiki\/Assassin's_Creed%3A_Bloodlines"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/store.playstation.com\/#!\/games\/assassin's-creed-bloodlines-psp\/cid=EP0001-NPEH00029_00-0000111122223333"}]}
