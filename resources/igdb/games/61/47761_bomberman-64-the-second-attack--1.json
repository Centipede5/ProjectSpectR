When the evil Rukifellth found one of these elements - the powerful Celestial Stone - he used his influence to assemble the dreaded BHB Army. Armed with his new army and a giant space warship, the power-crazed Rukifellth began scouring the galaxy for the other 7 elements, invading planets and enslaving innocent races throughout the galaxy. Rukifellth controls these enslaved planets with special Gravity Generators - the same devices the BHB Army used to create a Black Hole. Rukifellth uses his Black Hole to capture new planets... But he should have thought twice before he tried to capture Bomber Planet!","popularity":1,"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":961286400000,"platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":961286400000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jun-18","y":2000,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yuvmvwjpwjuzxsmgutlh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yuvmvwjpwjuzxsmgutlh","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yn4fbvmybsmpy3wga4nv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yn4fbvmybsmpy3wga4nv","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xgu0euwsir1hieyyip2p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xgu0euwsir1hieyyip2p","width":2100,"height":1526}}
