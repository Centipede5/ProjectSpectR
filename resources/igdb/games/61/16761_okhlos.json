Your beloved people will no longer stand for the abuse from their deities and have taken up arms against them and are hell bent on taking down anything and everything in their path. Topple the beastly minotaur, bring down sacred temples, and confront the almighty Olympians themselves while recruiting and balancing your unruly mob with warriors, peasants, slaves and even livestock in their quest for freedom from Mount Olympus! It\u2019s total anarchy in the birthplace of democracy.\n\nAn Unruly Mob: The people are angry and have united behind the noble philosophers to do their bidding to take down the soldiers, mythical beasts and temples under the control of the twelve vile gods. \n\nRecruit Followers: Carefully recruit your followers from warriors, peasants, slaves and beasts of burden and unlock special units or swap units for one of 100+ legendary heroes to upgrade the mob and increase their savagery. Wield the power of Heracles, Leonidas, Pandora, and Socrates to turn your mischievous gang into a formidable army! \n\nOne-of-a-Kind Battles: Every campaign against the gods is different with changes to heroes, monsters, and bosses \u2013 and even the mob itself \u2013 each time you and your followers set out for battle. Traverse eight procedurally generated Greek cities and never fight through the same world twice.\n\nBring Down Colossal Gods: Make your way through all manner of beasts, warriors, and demi-gods to arrive at the feet of the maleficent Olympians and unleash the power of the people in epic boss battles set against ancient ruins before they were ancient!","hypes":2,"popularity":5,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[79134,78550,18623,25311,21564,36553,17130,17111,18918,23345],"tags":[1,22,268435469,268435471,536870946,536870947,536871029,536871328,536873863,536875046,536875521,536876291,1073741827],"developers":[8277],"publishers":[634],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[34,35,117,416,2951,4134,4609,5379],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":1471478400000,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1471478400000,"human":"2016-Aug-18","y":2016,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1471478400000,"human":"2016-Aug-18","y":2016,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1471478400000,"human":"2016-Aug-18","y":2016,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s4xdtf1ql7fvrpgrvbpc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s4xdtf1ql7fvrpgrvbpc","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uuhixa55xuvmmypvfkxp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uuhixa55xuvmmypvfkxp","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nfqszbqfjfsgkzyxeyif.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nfqszbqfjfsgkzyxeyif","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lvtck7wnqhbsrx5tli9f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lvtck7wnqhbsrx5tli9f","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i3mjy8lxxvsgoeoosbvj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i3mjy8lxxvsgoeoosbvj","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay Trailer","video_id":"D5OywEQqH5w"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wfbei0qe8je2fpxqlxo3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wfbei0qe8je2fpxqlxo3","width":2464,"height":1412},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.okhlos.com"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/okhlos"}]}
