Players engage in stealth and combat missions such as recovering hostages, destroying radar stations, and stealing top-secret files. From a zoomed-out overhead perspective, players lead their unit into battle against enemy soldiers: Characters use guns and knives to kill enemies that splash small bursts of blood when struck; small pools of blood also appear next to enemy bodies and on the battlefield. During the course of the game, players can place cigarette packs in front of enemies in order to distract them. The word  sh*t  occasionally appears in text dialogue.","rating":5},"external":{"steam":"6810"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
