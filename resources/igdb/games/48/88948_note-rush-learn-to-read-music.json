Works with pianos, keyboards, flutes, violins, you name it! (See Q&A below for more about supported instruments.)\n\nStudent-paced\n------------------\nNote Rush goes as fast or as slow as the student with no time limits, so is suitable for complete beginners right through to being a fun challenge even for teachers!\n\nGrand Staff Context\n-----------------------\nThe whole grand staff is always visible, showing each note in full context and helping students learn how notes are spaced out\u00a0across the two staves.\n\nOctave-Sensitive Keyboard Geography\n---------------------------------------------\nIt's a \"B\", but which \"B\"?? Note Rush teaches keyboard geography by making sure you're getting the note in the right octave every time.\n\nGreat for Home Practise\n-------------------------\nStudents will rush to their instrument at home every day with NoteRush, chasing stars and high scores! Unlike flash cards, children can drill note identification at home with no music-reading parent required to check if they're getting them correct - Note Rush checks for you! Play every day and you'll be great at reading piano music in no time.\n\nLevels\n-------\nNote Rush has fifteen built-in Levels, from Middle C-Position right through to the full grand staff with 2 ledger lines above and below. There are Levels for Treble Clef, Bass Clef or full Grand Staff! Or make your own levels to practise reading specific notes, with sharps and flats for an added challenge!\n\nBetter Than Flash Cards!\n-------------------------\nUse Note Rush instead of printed flash cards! Note Rush was designed to replace the cards used in One Minute Club - a challenge you can run in your studio where students have to complete a given level in under a minute. Give it a try!\n\n--\nNote Rush is made by Thomas Grayston, a software developer, pianist, and husband to a piano teacher.","popularity":1,"games":[75245,88940,6080,26233,101956,101659,100916,100909,100767,99181],"tags":[268435463,536872030],"category":0,"keywords":[1118],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1466121600000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1466121600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Jun-17","y":2016,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ncdrhembo8pompu9qasv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ncdrhembo8pompu9qasv","width":576,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/otssmuxevzt1hlyhhjwu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"otssmuxevzt1hlyhhjwu","width":576,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zkqomfpqsmyn9yas5gvv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zkqomfpqsmyn9yas5gvv","width":576,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tgvt2swjjavbno93xzx9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tgvt2swjjavbno93xzx9","width":576,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uyighqvcrqwanrlvbnoh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uyighqvcrqwanrlvbnoh","width":576,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m1uwtdbxgb840qfhktf2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m1uwtdbxgb840qfhktf2","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t9rhepd9lumemsedxfwo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t9rhepd9lumemsedxfwo","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kuhdhemdvezasutkr98z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kuhdhemdvezasutkr98z","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yunjx81qddca13b0ghbi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yunjx81qddca13b0ghbi","width":392,"height":696},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/orqb90febz0mtf9ddhwc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"orqb90febz0mtf9ddhwc","width":392,"height":696}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tmuigrngrbiknr7cryhr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tmuigrngrbiknr7cryhr","width":512,"height":512},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/note-rush-learn-to-read-music\/id1083801827?mt=8&uo=4"}]}
