The game had different licenses with well-known cricketers in different countries. It was Audiogenic's second cricket game, 8 years after Graham Gooch's Test Match. \n \nAll the international sides are present, with the chance to change the player data and choose the team yourself. Test match and limited-overs matches are available, with 1 or 2 innings per team, and you can turn the Leg-before-wicket dismissal off, which makes the game easier to understand. \n \nThere are 3 skill levels - Amateur, Professional and World Class. The bowling involves positioning a cursor to place the bowl, then controlling the speed\/spin (depending on the type of bowler selected). Batting involves timing one of the many available shots, and fielding is largely automated.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[4680,13533,13532,13525,26748,46820,65196,63329,63328,63326],"tags":[268435470,536871635,1073741826],"publishers":[1292,7129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[723],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":757296000000,"platforms":[13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Allan Border's Cricket","comment":"Australian Title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kmtlzlubybahe4xyblql.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kmtlzlubybahe4xyblql","width":640,"height":819}}
