Controlling multiple different weapons the player must destroy enemy mechs before they try the same. Separate shields on the front and back of the mech must protect players from getting destroyed instantly. \n \nThe player can choose between different mechs and multiple difficulty levels. A map of the level is shown at the bottom of the screen at all times, but the player can only detect the enemy when he's in radar range.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,55803,25222,41895,22425,14605,70396,29730,11296,43130],"tags":[268435487,536871939],"category":0,"keywords":[1027],"genres":[31]}
