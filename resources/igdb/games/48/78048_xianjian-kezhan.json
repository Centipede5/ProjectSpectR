The game has the same protagonist, the young swordsman Li Xiaoyao, and is in a certain way a parody of Xianjian Qixia Zhuan. In this game, Li Xiaoyao still works for his aunt, doing various jobs in the inn. The game also features the female characters from the RPG - Li Xiaoyao's sweetheart Zhao Ling'er, Lin Yueru, and Anu. \n \nUnlike most installments in the series, Xianjian Kezhan is not a role-playing game, but a simulation. The player's goal in the game is to cook meals, prepare rooms, and generally take care of the guests. The game has an internal clock, and the hero should do his job well to please his aunt. When Li Xiaoyao is not busy with the inn, he can explore nearby locations or have a date with Ling'er. There are many items to be found, which can be later used for cooking and other purposes. The game has pre-rendered backgrounds and \"super-deformed\" graphics for characters.","franchise":1176,"franchises":[1176],"popularity":1,"games":[43130,28277,24048,36534,18398,36792,25311,236,41895,26145],"tags":[17,268435469,268435487,536871938,536875243,536878087],"developers":[14085],"publishers":[14085],"category":0,"keywords":[1026,4331,7175],"themes":[17],"genres":[13,31],"first_release_date":978307200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":978307200000,"region":6,"human":"2001-Jan-01","y":2001,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/svfsyqbeeqtfxmnu0skz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"svfsyqbeeqtfxmnu0skz","width":800,"height":1213}}
