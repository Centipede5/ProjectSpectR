Agon is the villain whose hordes you must destroy. The game is split across 7 multi-directional levels, taking in forests and caves in a fantasy setting. You are armed with a sword and a special energy-bolt attack, which can be charged up. Some vanquished enemies discard food or gold; there are shops in which to spend this.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[47823,37088,36926,12632,16468,26769,59516,36534,55092,36792],"tags":[1,17,22,268435468,268435487,536871063,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871244,536871939,536872092,536875042,536875258,536875791,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,226,227,296,332,1027,1180,4130,4346,4879],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[114,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mtykxd4g1kp48efal5i6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mtykxd4g1kp48efal5i6","width":710,"height":1000}}
