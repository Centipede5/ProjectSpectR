It is both \"Project Gun Frontier 2\" and \"Darius III\"; the game was developed by the Gun Frontier team, and ties to the original Darius development still exist.  \nPlayers control the Black Fly on their mission to defeat the forces of Nemesis in hopes of saving the human race. Players collected many small power-ups to build their weapon's power. Players could then unleash a large beam attack that would drain their power level back to zero. Bosses could also collect these power-ups and use similar beam attacks. When a player's beam collided with a bosses, it would culminate in a spectacular reaction before the more powerful attack would push the weaker down.","popularity":1,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,142,25300,71455,11253,27523],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870915,536871859,536871882,536871937,536874398,536875076,536875870,536876120,536876633,536878192,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[3,947,970,1025,3486,4164,4958,5208,5721,7280],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xhjm4okgjf1wvgxerwe0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xhjm4okgjf1wvgxerwe0","width":850,"height":1202}}
