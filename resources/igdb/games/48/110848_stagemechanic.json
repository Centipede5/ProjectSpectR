{"id":110848,"name":"StageMechanic","slug":"stagemechanic","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/stagemechanic","created_at":1539143653822,"updated_at":1539156294967,"summary":"About \/ Downloads \n \nWe are creating a game engine that allows one to play, create, and share 3D-tile\/block based games. \n \nStageMechanic is currently in Early Access and is available for PC and web through GameJolt and itch.io. \n \nStageMechanic for Android is available in the Google Play Store \n \nSales of the Full version go to help fund development and delivery of free, instructor-led 3D modeling and programming classes at the Hanock County Public Library located in one of the poorest, least educated states in the USA \n \nTarget audences \n \nEducation and Makers Movement \n \nWe include a built-in level editor that acts as the star of the show. \nThis project is being developed as a teaching aid for beginning game development students - ages 5 and up including adults. A primary goal of the project is to fill a gap between game creation tools like Bloxels and more advanced tools like Game Maker Studio. \n \nWith StageMechanic you are not just playing a game someone else made - you have the opportunity to create your own game and to learn from and build on games that others create. \n \nFor the casual aspiring creator, we offer a range of pre-made blocks and characters with different mechanics and creator-defined properties. \nIntermediate level creators can use the built-in Lua interpreter and code editor to modify all of the built in blocks, items, and characters and even create their own original mechanics. In the future users will also be able to easily import their own 3D models create in tools like MagicaVoxel and Tinkercad as well as create their own music, sound effects, etc. \n \nAdvanced users have full acess to the project's C# source code, allowing for infinite custamizability. As a professionally engineered and developed non-trivial project, StageMechanic offers a unique chance for students to move beyond tutorials and get hands on experience in a complex real-world game. \n \nAI Researchers \n \nFuture versions of StageMechanic will include both the Encog neural network library and TensorFlow accessable via the built-in Lua interpreter and code editor, allowing real-time AI experimentation. \n \n2D tile-based game-creation tool users \n \nUsers of game-creation tools like Super Mario Maker and Bloxels will find many of the same concepts in StageMechanic. You can create your own levels using the built-in level editor, play your own levels, share your levels, and play levels created by others. \nUnlike these games, StageMechanic is in 3D space and includes the possibility to script custom game mechanics - allowing for much more complex games. The built-in block and item types helps keep things simple for those just getting started. \n \nGame Developers \n \nStageMechanic is BSD licensed allowing anyone to create their own open-source or commercial games based on our engine.
