{"id":49148,"name":"Battle Dodge Ball","slug":"battle-dodge-ball","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/battle-dodge-ball","created_at":1500018059867,"updated_at":1516775137967,"summary":"Battle Dodge Ball is a part of the Japanese exclusive Compati Hero Series. Gundam, Kamen Rider V3, and Ultraman Taro are the main representatives of the 'heroes' side of the six teams in Battle Dodge Ball, with Zeong, Ika Devil, and Zetton rounding out as the villains. \n \nThe general gist of the game is that you can choose one of the six teams. You then fight each of the other five teams once per round in a short dodgeball game, two-on-two. Unlike normal dodgeball, you are not knocked out with a single hit. Rather, in Battle Dodge Ball, each character has a specific amount of HP. Once he takes enough hits to lose all his HP, he is out of the match. \n \nThe game also adds an RPG element in the ability to gain experience at the end of a match, win or lose, which can then be used to power up stats of your team's players.","collection":3072,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,11253,25300,36950,12632,55752,27209,11567,36926,68287],"tags":[1,18,268435470,536870926,536870990,536871079,536871208,536871587,536871882,536871938,536871987,536872078,536873299,536875054,536875073,536875289,536875348,536875595,536879218,536881795,536882301],"category":0,"keywords":[14,78,167,296,675,970,1026,1075,1166,2387,4142,4161,4377,4436,4683,8306,10883,11389],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":721872000000,"platforms":[38,33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1361836800000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Feb-26","y":2013,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":721872000000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Nov-16","y":1992,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Battle Dodgeball","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xzu7apciiffq9ujo5pfu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xzu7apciiffq9ujo5pfu","width":291,"height":500}}
