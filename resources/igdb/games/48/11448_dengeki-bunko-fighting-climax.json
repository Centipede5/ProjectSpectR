Characters mostly punch and kick each other to deplete opponent's life meters; several characters also use weapons such as guns, swords, and spears. Combat is highlighted by light effects, impact sounds, and realistic gunfire (with gun-toting characters). Some female characters wear revealing outfits (e.g., lingerie) in still-image galleries. One female character is depicted with exaggerated, jiggling breasts. The dialogue contains some suggestive material (e.g., \u201cYou're the one with a skirt so short that you almost show your underpants every time you jump!\u201d). One character is shown lighting and smoking a cigarette during his fights. The word \u201cbada*ses\u201d appears in the game.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Violence in a sporting context\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/climax.sega.jp\/"}]}
