Retail versions were released later that year. The new version contained a range of new features and enhancements, including enhanced menus, the new RS Cab Control driver interface and new RS Career System scenarios. Players could now earn Steam Achievements for completing scenarios, as well as compete and compare scores online via Steam Leaderboards. It also featured level crossing animations, among other improvements.[3] RailWorks 2 featured the same routes and content as the original game, and only one new route: TestTraK, based on the Test and validation centre, Wegberg-Wildenrath, a German testing facility that is used to test the performance and driving characteristics of the trains.[4] Contents in retail versions could vary in different countries to include local routes and locomotives. Owners of the original RailWorks received a free upgrade to the RailWorks 2 core technology via Steam platform.","collection":815,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[5549,7046,33153,14176,17111,51271,9066,5545,22425,31173],"tags":[268435469,536871906,536872010,536872060,536872070,536872205,536873973,536874136,536874706,536874916,536875046,536875058,536875059,536875062,536875242,536875265,536875271,536875437,536875668,536875730,536875781,536875887,536875901,536876396,536876424,536876502,536876578,536880100,536880423,536880424,1073741827,1073741828],"developers":[2461],"publishers":[2461],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[994,1098,1148,1158,1293,3061,3224,3794,4004,4134,4146,4147,4150,4330,4353,4359,4525,4756,4818,4869,4975,4989,5484,5512,5590,5666,9188,9511,9512],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":1287360000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1287360000000,"human":"2010-Oct-18","y":2010,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Train Simulator 2011"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pfvhy72flaovsriui116.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pfvhy72flaovsriui116","width":1280,"height":743},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/szo0ksjiaeivqyz7kuza.jpg","cloudinary_id":"szo0ksjiaeivqyz7kuza","width":1600,"height":900},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/todukuihm8zu4fedbcnp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"todukuihm8zu4fedbcnp","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xbss48ogwexvvazjuc4v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xbss48ogwexvvazjuc4v","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fbzqesmvureorobrem8y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fbzqesmvureorobrem8y","width":1680,"height":1050}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"E_XiNAKK_kE"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mogc8g24n6kegfbcpyw4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mogc8g24n6kegfbcpyw4","width":427,"height":600},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.railsimulator.com\/"}]}
