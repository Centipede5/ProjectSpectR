Keen must set out to Fribbulus Xax to save her! \n \nThe game begins with a top-down map of the Fribbulus Xax. This is the level select screen, where Billy can walk around and the player can choose the next level they want to enter; however, some places on the map require the player to find specific items (such as a grappling hook) to get through. On each level, Billy has to make his way to the exit. Once a level is completed, Billy ends up back on the overhead map.","popularity":1,"games":[1070,1073,10039,1188,36608,74863,51485,26848,34919,27239],"tags":[1,268435464,536872006],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":695433600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":695433600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jan-15","y":1992,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rmk4xe2o4k9nk6wzwido.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rmk4xe2o4k9nk6wzwido","width":980,"height":1239}}
