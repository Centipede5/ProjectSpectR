When playing against the CPU, players can also switch sides with the computer to make a move for the CPU. If the computer takes too long to make a move, the player may force the CPU to immediately make the best move it can think of, or cause the game to make an audible tone and pause before making the move.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55590,18623,19934,23345,9199,19376,55689,19847,19301],"tags":[34,268435469,268435471,536871292,536871446,536872060,536874694,536875160,536876049,536876763],"category":0,"keywords":[380,534,1148,3782,4248,5137,5851],"themes":[34],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":409449600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":409449600000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Dec-23","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vksug6awnlpa551vyjd0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vksug6awnlpa551vyjd0","width":403,"height":578},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
