Each ship has a different firing pattern, and all three of them combined together when the ships are formed together as the Moon Diver; their mission is to quell an alien invasion which is spanning all of the Milky Way, and destroy the aliens' headquarters: the Danger-Seed.[citation needed] \n \nThe player starts the game with three separate fighters and has to make it through four tubes using the fighters separately; if one gets destroyed, then the next, more powerful ship makes an attempt to get through. If the player makes it to the fifth stage, the three ships combine into a singular composite ship called the \"Moon Diver\", which has a massive amount of firepower - and each ship has shields, but the stages must be completed with one ship","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,36950,10209,28029,64204,27314,10213,71455,26766,25300],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871882,536873023,536875871,536875879,536879840],"category":0,"keywords":[166,970,2111,4959,4967,8928],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":631152000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":631152000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jan-01","y":1990,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jnyjkb2rcs0neerswdao.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jnyjkb2rcs0neerswdao","width":850,"height":1206}}
