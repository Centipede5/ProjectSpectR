Some weapons\/attacks result in decapitation or dismemberment that leaves bloodstains and body parts on the ground. Some finishing moves depict intense acts of violence: players can use a chainsaw-like weapon to slice enemies' necks or bodies; players can stomp on enemies' heads until they break apart.
