The game is based on the significantly improved Mount & Blade: Warband engine.\n\n'Caribbean!' lets players decide their own role and create their own adventure.\n\nThose who crave for battles in jungles, raids on rich cities and capturing enemy ships can choose the path of a pirate and a mercenary who will raise to the top with the help of his own sword.\n\nThose who aren't afraid of the words 'financial planning' can take pleasure in making great deals and expanding their business by choosing the path of a merchant and a business man. Rank and wealth can be achieved any way you like.\n\nOf course, if you're tired of fighting and boarding enemy ships, you can always invest your collected savings in good real estate. Or do it the other way around \u2014 sell all of your manufactures, buy a nice brig and become a pirate.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36926,25300,12632,36950,19333,27209,5982,34919,54842,17583],"tags":[1,536870916,536871139,536871776,536871938,536872544,536875419,536875477,536876374,536878535,536879058],"category":0,"keywords":[4,227,864,1026,1632,4507,4565,5462,7623,8146],"themes":[1],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jfvnfzr3szqczgua9clr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jfvnfzr3szqczgua9clr","width":600,"height":268}}
