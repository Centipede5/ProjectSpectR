As you kill each chicken, a new chicken is respawned. Gameplay is set over a field twice as wide as the screen, so you must be constantly moving your aim side to side in order to reach the whole game field. \n \nTo increase the difficulty, the chickens throw eggs at the screen to obscure the player's field of view. \n \nDuring the level, ammo crates drop at varying intervals which will refresh your ammo levels. \n \nCarry up to 6 weapons with you; only a couple are provided for free, the remaining weapons will need to be bought from the Range Shop, where you can also purchase extra ammo packs. \n \nThe game contains 8 different levels.
