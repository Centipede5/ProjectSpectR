It was the host of some of the most advanced medical labs in the entire country that collected data for the government trying to cure terminal illnesses. A major breakthrough was made with curing a terminal disease that seemed to remove all the symptoms from the patient. Hundreds of human patients from the city were tested with this new treatment  and every single one seemed to improve or be completely cured! That is, until the treatment reversed on them weeks later\u2026That was the night that Barrowsville changed forever. \n \nWhat was once the government\u2019s number one medical research city now became the nation\u2019s greatest fear. The city was shut down and contained by the government. No one was allowed in the city as well as no one was allowed out. Soon concrete walls were constructed and the people of Barrowsville were indefinitely trapped with the deadly disease that once was their beacon of hope. \n \nNow years later, all military personnel has left the city\u2019s borders due to a high level of inactivity from within the city and a lack of hope. With little assistance from the government, those still within the city are left to care for themselves and their loved ones. The light is full of raiders and the dark is full of mutants; no where at any time is safe. The final hour of daylight holds the most crucial hour of the day as it\u2019s time to slip into the darkness as they emerge from theirs. It\u2019s up the people within the walls to save themselves.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,29525,27314,27266,25300,28552,28148,13189,55289,10039],"tags":[1,19,38,268435461,268435487,268435488,536871365,536872371,536873651,1073741825],"game_engines":[439],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[453,1459,2739],"themes":[1,19,38],"genres":[5,31,32],"status":2,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/njzmwlxxvtp7wdmw8zja.jpg","cloudinary_id":"njzmwlxxvtp7wdmw8zja","width":512,"height":512},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/sharedfiles\/filedetails\/?id=875418975&searchtext=final+hour"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/barrystudiosgames"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/barrystudios"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/barrystudiosgames.com"}]}
