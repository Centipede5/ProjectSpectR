They are naturally upset and have imprisoned Jason in the Temple of Aphrodite with deadly Furies running overhead. You control Jason and your goal is to eliminate all of the Furies to move on to the next level. The Furies can be destroyed if they are hit with a magical brick from the roof of the temple. You are armed with an unlimited supply of stones, throwing a stone at the roof will cause a brick to fall (be careful, you'll lose a life if you hit yourself with a falling brick instead of the Furies). When a Fury is hit by a brick it is destroyed, but if you accidentally hit a Fury with a stone then it will multiply! The Furies will also be firing at you, and if you'll lose a life if hit. The game ends when you have no more lives left in reserve. Several difficulty levels are available.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[16468,28010,47823,37088,12632,36831,51485,26848,1221,27209],"tags":[1,17,268435489,536870947,536873260,536873261,536873262,1073741826],"developers":[2522],"publishers":[2522],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[35,2348,2349,2350],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/prgjg5nafj8hj2qgzwej.jpg","cloudinary_id":"prgjg5nafj8hj2qgzwej","width":800,"height":1076}}
