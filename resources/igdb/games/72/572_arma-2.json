is a first-person shooter in which players command soldiers in a strategic military campaign in the former Soviet Union. Players communicate with civilians to get intelligence; infiltrate enemy bases; rescue hostages; and destroy specific targets. Players use a variety of realistic firearms (e.g., assault rifles, pistols, and machine guns) and vehicles (e.g., helicopters and tanks) to shoot at enemies that often cry out in pain or emit small sprays of blood. Players can also elect to shoot at civilian bystanders or friendly soldiers, but such action is heavily discouraged: players can be court-martialed or attacked by other civilians. Some dialogue contains strong profanity (e.g., \"motherf*cker,\" \"a*shole,\" and \"sh*t\"), and there are occasional sexual references (e.g., a mention of rape; a strong allusion to prostitution; and a joke about fellatio).\r\n\r\nOnline Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Multiple, motiveless killing - Strong language\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/33910"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.arma2.com"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ARMA2official"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bohemiainteract"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ARMA2Official"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ARMA_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/community.bistudio.com\/wiki\/Main_Page"}],"external":{"steam":"33910"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
