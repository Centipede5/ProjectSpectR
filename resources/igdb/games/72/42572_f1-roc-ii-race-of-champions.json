Drive real cars, like the FW14B Williams, McLaren's MP4\/7, the F92 Ferrari, the V8 Ford-powered Benettion B192, and other Formula One racing machines. You'll start out in a prototype Group C car and must win on all 8 tracks to move up. Next you race in F3000 cars to develop the lightning-fast reflexes needed to survive Formula One racing. Finally, you face the real 1992 Formula One season drivers and their cars. On the 16 international courses, it's a duel of nerves, skill, grit and nitro. This game blows the competition away. \n \nA new standard in racing simulation is born and F1-ROC II is it.","collection":4365,"popularity":1,"games":[58785,42268,38172,38171,40470,69725,48498,41649,28856,80441],"tags":[268435466,536874337,536875069,536875117,536876749],"category":0,"keywords":[3425,4157,4205,5837],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":733968000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":733968000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Apr-05","y":1993,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Exhaust Heat 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t2ul5utoasoolbj7dqad.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t2ul5utoasoolbj7dqad","width":2100,"height":1506}}
