The plot revolves around an elderly couple with no children who adopt an infant boy and girl. When the children turn six, a dragon appears in the country, and starts turning people into Oni who steal the souls of others. The Oni arrive at their home and steal the elderly couple's souls. The children decide to save their adoptive parents.\n\nThe game is controlled by selecting commands such as the \"Change Character\" command, which allows you to switch between controlling Donbe (the boy) and Hikari (the girl). The game progress is shown by changes in the in-game graphics. The Famicom Disk System version comes on two disks released on different dates. Disk 2 cannot be played without completing Disk 1, and is switched while the system is still powered on. All later releases are switch-free.","popularity":1,"games":[25877,41042,24426,54775,26951,18398,28309,62151,47823,81249],"tags":[17,268435487,536871208,536871939,1073741826],"developers":[421],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"keywords":[296,1027],"themes":[17],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1092096000000,"platforms":[41,24,37,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1182211200000,"human":"2007-Jun-19","y":2007,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1092096000000,"human":"2004-Aug-10","y":2004,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1092096000000,"human":"2004-Aug-10","y":2004,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1092096000000,"human":"2004-Aug-10","y":2004,"m":8}],"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shin_Onigashima\u200e"}]}
