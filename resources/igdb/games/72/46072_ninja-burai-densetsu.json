You are in control of a team of ninjas fighting another team. C selects a ninja\/confirms an action. B cancels an action, or if no action is in progress, selects the next ninja. A opens the battle menu, which allows you to end your turn. Battles are fully automatic. Unique to Ninja Burai Densetsu are side-scrolling special stages: should you move a ninja onto a special space, they will go into a town where they can get various helpful items from townsfolk.","popularity":2.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":694569600000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":694569600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jan-05","y":1992,"m":1}]}
