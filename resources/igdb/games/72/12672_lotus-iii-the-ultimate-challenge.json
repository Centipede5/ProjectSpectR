{"id":12672,"name":"Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge","slug":"lotus-iii-the-ultimate-challenge","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/lotus-iii-the-ultimate-challenge","created_at":1442516392448,"updated_at":1517270888625,"summary":"The third game in the series combined the gameplay aspects of its predecessors, allowing players to choose between racing opponents of Lotus Turbo Challenge or the arcade-like time trials of Lotus 2. The two-player option was retained and the music selection feature returns (Patrick Phelan's soundtrack to Lotus III spawned many modern remixes). Lotus III also added a third car - a concept Lotus M200 automobile - and allowed the player to choose which one to race with. The game recycled most of the graphics from Lotus 2, but added a number of new sceneries.","collection":1033,"rating":93.28604343206912,"popularity":2,"total_rating":93.28604343206912,"total_rating_count":6,"rating_count":6,"games":[27553,27378,3772,55192,18728,19462,40470,74171,19539,642],"tags":[268435466,536871294,536872103,536872695,536873065,536874337,536874966,536875069,536875093,536875117,536875901,536875942,536876108,536876435,536879193,1073741826],"developers":[561],"publishers":[1210],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[382,1191,1783,2153,3425,4054,4157,4181,4205,4989,5030,5196,5523,8281],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Lotus III: The Ultimate Challenge","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Lotus II: R.E.C.S","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Lotus II: RECS","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Lotus: The Ultimate Challenge","comment":"PC DOS Title"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"9vXisK-UMCA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yox1q8zsgyweeszgqwgh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yox1q8zsgyweeszgqwgh","width":630,"height":826}}
