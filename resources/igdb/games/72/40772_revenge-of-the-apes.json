Planned as the Planet of the Apes franchise's first video game, it was still in the prototype phase when Fox shuttered its game division during the video game crash of 1983. It went unreleased and was assumed lost until 2002, when collectors identified a mislabeled cartridge as the missing Planet of the Apes game. It was completed and released as Revenge of the Apes by Retrodesign in 2003.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23175,37022,55289,59516,13189,25222,25646,55803,42080,41895],"tags":[1,268435487,536871939],"category":0,"keywords":[1027],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1054425600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":1054425600000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Jun-01","y":2003,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ni0azstvt1rwcx6b8wpt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ni0azstvt1rwcx6b8wpt","width":600,"height":855}}
