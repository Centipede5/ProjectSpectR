{"id":18572,"name":"Seymour Goes To Hollywood","slug":"seymour-goes-to-hollywood","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/seymour-goes-to-hollywood","created_at":1459457573060,"updated_at":1542495580712,"summary":"Seymour Goes to Hollywood, also known as Seymour at the Movies, is a platform and adventure game developed by Big Red Software and originally published in Europe by Codemasters in 1991. Players control Seymour, a small potato-like creature who wishes to be a film star. The film's script has been locked in a safe, meaning Seymour must solve puzzles by collecting and using objects scattered throughout the game in order to progress, ultimately retrieving the script and allowing filming to start.\nThe game was originally designed as part of the Dizzy series, with a working title of Movieland Dizzy, but the creators of Dizzy disagreed with the real-world direction the game had taken, despite it being 90% complete. The developers, Big Red Software, were given 12 weeks to create a new game with a different character. Seymour was adapted from Dizzy, with a new shape and fingers to differentiate the two.\nSeymour Goes to Hollywood received both positive and average ratings from the video game press at the time, and was compared to Dizzy video games both positively and negatively. The character also received both praise and criticism for his shape.","storyline":"Seymour has been given the starring role in a Hollywood film and duly arrives at the film studio to begin work. It transpires that the studio's boss, Dirk E. Findlemeyer the second, has taken a vacation to Miami. Findlemeyer has taken the key to his safe with him, which prevents filming from commencing because the safe contains the film scripts. Seymour must blow the safe with dynamite to access the scripts and then collect 16 Academy Awards from around the game and award one to each of the actors. Only then can filming commence.","collection":2117,"popularity":1,"games":[33269,20342,24426,27192,56033,19150,55173,37419,28309,62151],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536871939,536872961,536876292,536879691,1073741828],"developers":[9486],"publishers":[115],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1027,2049,5380,8779],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":676166400000,"platforms":[63,13,16,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":16,"date":676166400000,"region":1,"human":"1991-Jun-06","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":25,"date":676166400000,"region":1,"human":"1991-Jun-06","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":63,"date":676166400000,"region":1,"human":"1991-Jun-06","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":676166400000,"region":1,"human":"1991-Jun-06","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":676166400000,"region":1,"human":"1991-Jun-06","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":676166400000,"region":1,"human":"1991-Jun-06","y":1991,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t0nbnufvkjf9bmfjc0oa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t0nbnufvkjf9bmfjc0oa","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ufeivbxhj0n0j0vkvyrl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ufeivbxhj0n0j0vkvyrl","width":640,"height":400}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"ZpqFrncbp30"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aoufiz9kuur3fyhpdoek.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aoufiz9kuur3fyhpdoek","width":659,"height":1007},"esrb":{"rating":1},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Seymour_Goes_to_Hollywood"}]}
