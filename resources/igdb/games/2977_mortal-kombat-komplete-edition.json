{"id":2977,"name":"Mortal Kombat : Komplete Edition","slug":"mortal-kombat-komplete-edition","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/mortal-kombat-komplete-edition","created_at":1381156827037,"updated_at":1535471119993,"summary":"Raiden is about to be killed by Shao Kahn, and just before he delivers the last blow, Raiden sends a mental message to his earlier self by saying that he must win, and the camera rewinds back to Mortal Kombat 1. The Raiden from Mortal Kombat 1 then gets the message and experiences a premonition. The game then spans Mortal Kombat 1, 2, and 3, retelling the story with an enlightened Raiden, who has changed the course of events. Eventually, everything the player has seen happen before \u2014 Liu Kang winning, Lin Kuei turning into cybernetic ninjas, has been altered. You might see a cybernetic character who wasn't before, and a different version of events.","storyline":"Following the events of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, both the forces of light and darkness have been wiped out, with only the thunder god Raiden and Shao Kahn remaining to represent their parties. A severely weakened Raiden is about to be killed by Shao Kahn, but casts a last-minute spell on his now-shattered magical amulet, directing it to contact his past self with the vague message \"He must win\". \nDuring the events of the first tournament hosted by Shang Tsung, the past version of Raiden sees visions of the future courtesy of a now cracked amulet. Raiden initially comes to the conclusion that fighter Liu Kang is to win the tournament and save Earthrealm from Outworld. Pivotal characters such as Johnny Cage, Sonya Blade, Jax Briggs, Sektor, Cyrax, Nightwolf, Kitana, Jade, and Sub-Zero are introduced, the latter being murdered by the hellspawn Scorpion. In time, Liu Kang remains the only Earthrealm champion, and succeeds in defeating Shang Tsung and the Shokan Prince Goro. However, Raiden's amulet continues to deteriorate, a sign that future events remain unchanged. Disappointed with Shang Tsung's failure, Shao Kahn orders his execution, but relents when the sorcerer suggests holding the second tournament in Outworld. Raiden initially refuses, but is forced to relent when Shang Tsung threatens to unleash Outworld's armies upon Earthrealm.","collection":22,"rating":79.7880138430454,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":83.7777777777778,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":81.7828958104116,"total_rating_count":50,"rating_count":39,"version_parent":119,"version_title":"Komplete Edition","games":[103282,90101,26879,81249,76736,76064,16468,28010,101608,1221],"tags":[1,17,268435460,536870973,1073741828],"developers":[392,48],"publishers":[50],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":72000,"normally":126000,"completely":180000},"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[61],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":1303171200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,46,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1303171200000,"human":"2011-Apr-19","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1303171200000,"human":"2011-Apr-19","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1335830400000,"human":"2012-May-01","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1375747200000,"human":"2013-Aug-06","y":2013,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MK9","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Mortal Kombat 9"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mnoty5nhpypzwcujtwry.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mnoty5nhpypzwcujtwry","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l6tyrvh8jwpone8nyu8m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l6tyrvh8jwpone8nyu8m","width":1200,"height":900},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fac7dvvignghvvf7qplh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fac7dvvignghvvf7qplh","width":640,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/patvotkgegyfjhyjzxbl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"patvotkgegyfjhyjzxbl","width":620,"height":348},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yavmq2evc2xym1jxynhb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yavmq2evc2xym1jxynhb","width":1024,"height":576}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"YcDFkJWxY1M"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ZUE7vJwwcxk"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"wbwALe_qBaY"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qscrhgzffnyblbskedqk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qscrhgzffnyblbskedqk","width":728,"height":871},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one battles against characters from the fantasy-based Mortal Kombat universe. Players compete in a series of combative rounds in order to advance to different matches throughout the game. Players use swords, guns, chains, spikes, and supernatural attacks (e.g., fire, ice, lightning) to defeat a cast of human-like characters. After an opponent is defeated at the end of a match, players have the option to perform finishing moves called 'Fatalities.' Many of these finishing moves depict over-the-top instances of violence: impalement, bone-crushing body snaps, execution-style gunshots to the head; large blood-splatter effects occur during these sequences, staining characters' bodies and the ground. Several of these exaggerated finishing moves depict characters getting dismembered, ripped or sliced in half, stabbed, set on fire, or set to explode. During the course of the game, female characters sometimes wear revealing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; one female fighter is depicted partially nude, covered by a costume of thin cloth strips. Language such as 'f**k' occasionally appears in the dialogue.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/237110"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.mortalkombat.com"}],"external":{"steam":"237110"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
