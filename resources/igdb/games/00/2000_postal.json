{"id":2000,"name":"Postal","slug":"postal","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/postal","created_at":1364573686776,"updated_at":1547502740557,"summary":"Postal is a survival horror isometric third-person shooter video game developed by Running With Scissors and published by Ripcord Games in 1997. A sequel to the game, Postal\u00b2, was released in 2003. Director Uwe Boll has bought the movie rights for the series, and has produced a film of the same name. A March 2001 re-release of the game, called Postal Plus, included a \"Special Delivery\" add-on","storyline":"There is no plot as such. The presence of a moving van on the first level suggests that the Postal Dude has been evicted from his home and is therefore \"going postal\", but no background story evolves during the game. However, the manual hints that the Postal Dude believes himself to be targeted by the town, and in-between levels, players are given a chance to delve into his psychosis with ominous diary entries containing phrases like \"The earth is hungry. Its heart throbs and demands cleansing. The earth is also thirsty...\". The game ends with the Postal Dude attempting to massacre an elementary school, but failing due to having a mental breakdown and ending up getting captured by the government and incarcerated in an asylum.","collection":371,"rating":71.2072488218877,"popularity":4.666666666666666,"total_rating":71.2072488218877,"total_rating_count":21,"rating_count":21,"games":[32902,10039,103301,105269,103298,105049,76747,37419,76263,102868],"tags":[1,268435461,268435488,536871052,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[140],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,32],"first_release_date":875577600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":5,"platform":6,"date":875577600000,"human":"1997-Q3","y":1997,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bpvr3m1y0gjvpxjtku9m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bpvr3m1y0gjvpxjtku9m","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gclux8mjlusd87w2s1bi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gclux8mjlusd87w2s1bi","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rqeqxfkv91t2sxyeyk6y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rqeqxfkv91t2sxyeyk6y","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iabmgwmcg61genfvt7mv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iabmgwmcg61genfvt7mv","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o2inbcvq50j5duyi4ixk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o2inbcvq50j5duyi4ixk","width":259,"height":194}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"2aRoNwLWPD0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/az49nna5gblmrslmt1tn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"az49nna5gblmrslmt1tn","width":199,"height":253},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.runningwithscissors.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/232770"}],"external":{"steam":"232770"}}
