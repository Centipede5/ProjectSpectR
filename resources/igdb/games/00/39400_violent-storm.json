In the beginning, World War III has at last expired. The people are left to pick up the pieces and rebuild their civilizations. However, vicious gangs that prey on these defenseless citizens are obstructing the reconstruction. \n \nThe main protagonists are Boris, Wade and Kyle, vigilantes who protect the feared and helpless. Their largest problem is the corrupt, incorrigible, ruthless and lethal gang known as \"The Geld Gang\". They have commissioned every type of person imaginable. Purple-haired, leather-clad, chain-wielding, lead-pipe swinging, masked, martial art, orange-mohawked and men so strong and immune to pain they use manhole covers as shields. \n \nOne day, when the trio is patrolling the streets, alert, ready and able to help those in need, they see a woman named Sheena (a friend of theirs) waving at them walking across the street out of a supermarket with groceries. A moment later, Lord Geld's right hand man, Red Freddy, snatches her away while riding on his purple hog. Now, the three braves must save Sheena from the grips of Lord Geld.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[71455,7329,1907,44076,28380,36897,5370,10039,26145,10444],"tags":[268435460,268435481,536870981,536871213,536871889,536871894,536871971,536872581,536875098,536875198,536875308,536875476,536875610,536875731,536876356,536876365,536878278,536884481],"category":0,"keywords":[69,301,977,982,1059,1669,4186,4286,4396,4564,4698,4819,5444,5453,7366,13569],"genres":[4,25],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ifvriqd5x2txb1mn5ryv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ifvriqd5x2txb1mn5ryv","width":880,"height":1152}}
