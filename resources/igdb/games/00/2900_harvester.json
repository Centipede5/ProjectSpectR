{"id":2900,"name":"Harvester","slug":"harvester","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/harvester","created_at":1375793821651,"updated_at":1537022208021,"summary":"The game's play is done through a point and click interface. Players must visit various locations within the game's fictional town of Harvest, which can be done via an overhead map. By speaking to various townspeople and clicking on special \"hotspots\", players can learn information and collect items that progress the game's story and play. Harvester also features a fighting system where players can attack other characters by selecting a weapon and then clicking on the target. Both the target and the player's character have a limited amount of health available, allowing for either the player or the target to die. Players can choose to progress through the game by solving puzzles or by killing one of the non-playable characters.","storyline":"The game stars Steve, who awakes with a case of amnesia in a strange town in 1953 called Harvest. He can't remember anything from his past and when he tells the people that claim to be his family, as well as townsfolk, they all tell him what a kidder he is. All of the town inhabitants are extremely eccentric and many appear to be more a satire or stereotype than real people. They all continuously stress to Steve that he should join the Lodge, which is a large building located at the center of town that serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Harvest Moon. Steve visits the Sergeant at Arms at the Lodge, who tells him that all of his questions will be answered inside the building. To enter, he must first join the Order of the Harvest Moon. But in order to join, he must perform a series of tasks that range from simple vandalism to arson for his initiation.","hypes":1,"rating":80,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":4,"games":[15830,51524,13189,11296,25646,33822,14760,14176,19561,56033],"tags":[1,19,268435487,536871041,536871133,536871255,536871939,536872032,536872070,536872451,536872581,536872626,536872647,536872799,536873454,536875331,536875358,536875426,536875448,536875526,536875531,536875831,536875900,536876332,536876348,536876630,536876642,536876663,536877122,536877306,536877357,536877551,536878069,536878077,536878208,536880622,1073741828],"developers":[3163],"publishers":[3161,3162,141],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[129,221,343,1027,1120,1158,1539,1669,1714,1735,1887,2542,4419,4446,4514,4536,4614,4619,4919,4988,5420,5436,5718,5730,5751,6210,6394,6445,6639,7157,7165,7296,9710],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":841881600000,"platforms":[6,13],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":841881600000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Sep-05","y":1996,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":841881600000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Sep-05","y":1996,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z2zawg8fzva1htq0dvyf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z2zawg8fzva1htq0dvyf","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kfbpixhpiacqi1ova8gi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kfbpixhpiacqi1ova8gi","width":1024,"height":640},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/haeyvl5zyzp5wg75tw7e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"haeyvl5zyzp5wg75tw7e","width":1292,"height":984},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dbponexkqnlcnedzing4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dbponexkqnlcnedzing4","width":1024,"height":640},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pw52nj5ydfg1rvne0l62.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pw52nj5ydfg1rvne0l62","width":1024,"height":768}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/djnylzldynseovajqhup.jpg","cloudinary_id":"djnylzldynseovajqhup","width":1459,"height":1830},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.nightdivestudios.com\/games\/harvester\/?utm_source=steampowered.com&amp;utm_medium=product&amp;utm_campaign=website%20-%20harvester"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/287020"}],"external":{"steam":"287020"}}
