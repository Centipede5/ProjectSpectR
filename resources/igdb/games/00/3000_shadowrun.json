A time where the blending of technology and human flesh is common; it is around the time the Matrix, a huge computer network, came online, with the ability to jack into its cyberspace directly. It was also a time of magic renewal: a phenomenon known as The Awakening occurred, where magic returned into the world. Sorcery was once again possible, and slowly and seemingly at random humans began to mutate into orcs, dwarves, elves or trolls. This time of upheaval was not without political conflicts: mega-corporations began to control the world. But with their magic, native shamans threatened them and the world geography came to a complete change. The Amerindians and Elves reclaimed an area called Salish-Shidhe, close to the free city of Seattle, a major city in the newly formed United Canadian and American States.","collection":554,"franchise":127,"franchises":[127],"rating":86,"popularity":3.666666666666667,"total_rating":86,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":4,"games":[1877,7640,2933,55038,7208,9611,22387,36950,3025,25300],"tags":[1,17,18,33,38,268435468,268435481,268435487,536870933,536871006,536871008,536871015,536871018,536871033,536871130,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871470,536871501,536871504,536871535,536871801,536871882,536871938,536871939,536871969,536872234,536872335,536872352,536872435,536872647,536872695,536872978,536874134,536874398,536874745,536875050,536875075,536875154,536875158,536875196,536875214,536875242,536875243,536875258,536875271,536875300,536875326,536875358,536875361,536875372,536875380,536875426,536875437,536875455,536875483,536875523,536875525,536875538,536875572,536875624,536875762,536875767,536875803,536875837,536875870,536875934,536875957,536876301,536876687,536876712,536877501,536877646,536877831,536878317,536878349,536878373,536880269,1073741827],"developers":[1402],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[21,94,96,103,106,121,218,226,227,296,301,558,589,592,623,889,970,1026,1027,1057,1322,1423,1440,1523,1735,1783,2066,3222,3486,3833,4138,4163,4242,4246,4284,4302,4330,4331,4346,4359,4388,4414,4446,4449,4460,4468,4514,4525,4543,4571,4611,4613,4626,4660,4712,4850,4855,4891,4925,4958,5022,5045,5389,5775,5800,6589,6734,6919,7405,7437,7461,9357],"themes":[1,17,18,33,38],"genres":[12,25,31],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ewbsttvphp19ecswmrpc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ewbsttvphp19ecswmrpc","width":640,"height":448},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ryvijmrtqrxvtufgekc4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ryvijmrtqrxvtufgekc4","width":640,"height":448},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yabtt77hocn2mxup5a75.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yabtt77hocn2mxup5a75","width":640,"height":468},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qepbjfikfg32avkozl1r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qepbjfikfg32avkozl1r","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nxwzb5fzgesy0vpmil6f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nxwzb5fzgesy0vpmil6f","width":640,"height":448}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n9givft1znmra89ggrow.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n9givft1znmra89ggrow","width":345,"height":480},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shadowrun_(1994_video_game)"}]}
