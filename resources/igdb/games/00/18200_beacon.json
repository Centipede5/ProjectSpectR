{"id":18200,"name":"Beacon","slug":"beacon","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/beacon","created_at":1457280398136,"updated_at":1533892201411,"summary":"Beacon is a sci-fi themed Action Roguelike. Played as a top-down shooter, you must fight your way through a randomly generated hostile world, all the while trying to locate your emergency distress beacon and escape the planet into which your ship has crashed. \n \nWhile you\u2019re making your way through these areas you\u2019ll not only find weapons and items to help you; You\u2019ll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. Then, when you inevitably die, you\u2019re given the opportunity to combine the DNA you\u2019ve collected to your own, granting you different stats and potentially gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next run. \n \nBeacon aims to create a bridge between fast, frenetic action and long-term strategy, where your actions can be felt and built upon hours down the line.","storyline":"You step out of the confined pod, disorientated and blinking. As your vision clears, a desolate view forms to greet you. The burning wreckage of your ship - your home - lies scattered cruelly across the surface of an alien landscape.  \n  \nYou must have come down hard. Picking your way through the remains of the ship, you look for answers, a weapon, a radio. Instead, you find a body. Your body.  \n  \nWell, you think, at least the cloning bay still works.  \n  \nUnfortunately, it seems like that\u2019s about all that does. If you want to get off this planet, you\u2019re going to have to explore it. You need to find equipment. You need to build a beacon. The forests look hostile, but you\u2019ve got your gun.  \n  \nAnd if the worst comes to pass, well, at least the cloning bay still works.","hypes":2,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[28029,103020,68287,90099,103298,306,27011,103281,105269,89554],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536872147,536872422,536872879,1073741827],"developers":[9339],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1235,1510,1967],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,32],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"pulse_count":6,"platforms":[6,14,49],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":49,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/plrh6dxxhfk6mmwksqht.jpg","cloudinary_id":"plrh6dxxhfk6mmwksqht","width":2004,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qfbjmyy3ina0r48zxsok.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qfbjmyy3ina0r48zxsok","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/evkmlb0vh7qde4zgy3lc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"evkmlb0vh7qde4zgy3lc","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ftm0mhuqfspzdd53iyaq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ftm0mhuqfspzdd53iyaq","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kogt07inku3spazvzllu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kogt07inku3spazvzllu","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"First Access Trailer","video_id":"UGylqx_4gbQ"},{"name":"Reveal Trailer","video_id":"YJxUhGaXFcE"},{"name":"Gameplay Trailer","video_id":"URHvu9eYdWk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ua8l78qz6aeqbj9a2dze.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ua8l78qz6aeqbj9a2dze","width":1058,"height":1500},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/856610"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/monothetic"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/monothetic"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MONOTHETIC"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/monothetic.com\/beacon\/"}],"external":{"steam":"856610"}}
