In this one-player, side-scrolling action game, you'll play as Daffy Duck, who's been told by Bugs Bunny about a secret hidden treasure. Your job is to find it! Too bad Bugs and the rest of the Looney Tunes crew have decided to stop your treasure-hunting journey cold. Play through nine stages of platforming action as you look to get rich quick. There are a few puzzle elements as well that require you to push crates and use dynamite sticks to clear a path. DAFFY DUCK: Fowl Play features large, well-animated characters set on detailed backgrounds, and although it has been enhanced for Game Boy Color, this game is compatible with both Game Boy and Game Boy Color systems.","collection":3417,"franchise":92,"franchises":[92],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[71628,19150,33269,24426,55173,10039,20342,56033,26820,76723],"tags":[1,268435464,536872961,536872986,536873096,536873958,536873959,536873960,536873962,536875054,536875079,536876694,536878439,1073741828],"developers":[251],"publishers":[251],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2049,2074,2184,3046,3047,3048,3050,4142,4167,5782,7527],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":944006400000,"status":6,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":944006400000,"human":"1999-Dec-01","y":1999,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wdc3cyccrm08iw8tvz4c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdc3cyccrm08iw8tvz4c","width":200,"height":260},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
