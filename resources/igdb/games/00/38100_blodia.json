Classics like Tetris, Puzzle Bobble, Klax....and then there's Blodia. The concept behind Blodia is very simple: 1-You have a screen of pipe-work. 2-There is a ball travelling down the pipe. 3-If the ball drops down a gap in the pipe you have to start again. That's it. So what this all amounts to is you frantically sliding the tiles around block-puzzle style to keep that cursed ball bearing on track. God forbid that you think the ball is moving too slowly, you can even push a button to speed the damn thing up, but you have to wonder why you would ever want to do that. \n \n(from the PC Engine Software Bible)","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,60044,26223,14047,38586,27266,8197,9105,54678,25646],"tags":[268435465,536871878,536872617,536873787,536875075,536875151],"category":0,"keywords":[966,1705,2875,4163,4239],"genres":[9],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mbbttfxqosfm9uwaoddj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mbbttfxqosfm9uwaoddj","width":493,"height":569}}
