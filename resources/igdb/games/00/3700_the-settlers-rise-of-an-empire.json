Everything in this richly detailed, realistic world is visible and lovingly animated. Each Settler figure has his or her own daily routine, with a range of different actions and behaviors that can be observed at all times. The ultimate objective of the game is to expand your empire and become a legendary ruler. \nSpur your settlers on to ever greater efforts, develop a flourishing economy, satisfy the needs of your citizens, and protect your people from danger!","storyline":"Your settlers have needs and lives of their own. If they have too little to eat, they will fall ill or feel threatened, and your town will come to a standstill. If they are well fed and happy, they will worship you. The seasons and extreme weather conditions will test your skills as a master builder. \nHave you enough food supplies to see your settlers through the harsh winter? Have you made sure that the woodcutters have not cut down all the trees in the forest, destroying the environment of the wild animals your hunters bring down for food? Other nations and settlements will try to loot your towns or even destroy them once they become rich and prosperous. Put your troops on your town walls to keep a lookout for enemies, or send them out to attack any foes trying to capture the last stone quarry from under your nose. \nIn Campaign mode you can establish an empire with your knights and heroes that encompasses lands and continents. Choosing the right knights to master the diverse challenges of each mission is crucial. Will you go down in history as the greatest ruler of all times ? \nIn Campaign mode you can establish an empire with your knights and heroes that encompasses lands and continents.
