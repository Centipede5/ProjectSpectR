In the \"gangsters mode\", you simply have to escape the city while avoiding the cops. In the \"police mode\", you have to control 5 police cars in order to prevent the gangsters from escaping the city and arrest them. Those two modes give some diversity to the game although its expectancy is a little short.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,55678,40470,36608,34919,19934,36662,67149,15231,16468],"tags":[1,268435466,536872581,536875069,536875361,1073741826],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1669,4157,4449],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[63,13,16,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":25,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/furlw6wo7jkemvvwagbz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"furlw6wo7jkemvvwagbz","width":320,"height":200}}
