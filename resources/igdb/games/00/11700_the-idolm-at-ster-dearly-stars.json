The game is a spin-off of THE iDOLM@STER series and its timeline coincides before the events in THE iDOLM@STER 2. The gameplay in Dearly Stars is similar to previous games in the series, but with new elements and differences to the minigames. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story, but head director also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. The story is told from the perspective of three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player has access to the three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.","collection":957,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[44154,2655,11699,7013,7014,26563,28558,7015,75992,44242],"tags":[268435463,268435469,536870955,536871080,536871186,536872026,536872452,536872594,1073741829,1073741826],"developers":[5024],"publishers":[5024],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[43,168,274,1114,1540,1682],"genres":[7,13],"first_release_date":1253145600000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1253145600000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Sep-17","y":2009,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"THE iDOLMASTER Dearly Stars"},{"name":"\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30c7\u30a3\u30a2\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nsafx7dg7svuauiwjwjr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nsafx7dg7svuauiwjwjr","width":333,"height":500},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xy0xedynoyb5gfjmpqjg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xy0xedynoyb5gfjmpqjg","width":333,"height":500},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q2djlhcdbbe3ju1zbvou.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q2djlhcdbbe3ju1zbvou","width":333,"height":500}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"30OvK9e5kRY"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ywf826xniw3lrivdmwao.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ywf826xniw3lrivdmwao","width":500,"height":451},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.bandainamcogames.co.jp\/cs\/list\/idolmaster\/ds\/"}]}
