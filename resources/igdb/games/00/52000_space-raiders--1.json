Developed on java, using LibGDX. Developed by Kiril Raykov and published for Android devices. The game is also scheduled for a release on Windows. \n \nGame description: \nou are a space guardian and your job is to save your planet from the \u0430pproaching invaders. \nThe aim is to defeat every enemy and pass all the levels in order to save the day! You control the shooting and the movement of your ship, which you can update more and more with every single level. The enemies are getting stronger, smarter and faster with every level passed so you have to focus on more accurate and faster reactions. Every 12 levels you face a mighty Boss space ship! You will battle lots of enemies with different powers, but remember that every ship has it's weakness. Some of the levels get extremely hard but that's the fun of it. It won't be a good game if it's easy, right? \n \nPlease note that this is my first game and overall finished project. I know it's not something impressive, but I'm pretty excited about it, since I've been learning game development and programming in general from not long ago. I've published it for experience and learning purposes. Nevermind, I would like to hear you out about it. Cheers! \n \nLink to the game trailer: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RLTzMKBi-Dc \n \nLink to the game itself: https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kiril.main.game","popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[24,588,706,3149,3945,3946],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":1500854400000,"status":2,"platforms":[34],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1500854400000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Jul-24","y":2017,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/labztyhyeamgr8qfqe2c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"labztyhyeamgr8qfqe2c","width":1080,"height":1620},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qhlm2rpv9vrg3bcdwphb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qhlm2rpv9vrg3bcdwphb","width":1080,"height":1620},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y212sr9gb3nv5vckm4lt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y212sr9gb3nv5vckm4lt","width":1080,"height":1920},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/evccgvfocdebkpbewvff.jpg","cloudinary_id":"evccgvfocdebkpbewvff","width":1080,"height":1920},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fbcfwuuza7numan3jhcc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fbcfwuuza7numan3jhcc","width":1080,"height":1920}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"RLTzMKBi-Dc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r9sfgerq0ewp6u90hmch.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r9sfgerq0ewp6u90hmch","width":1024,"height":500},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.kiril.main.game"}]}
