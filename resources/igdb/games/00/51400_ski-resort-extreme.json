It was developed and released in 2004 by Cat Daddy Games who also developed the very similar Ski Resort Tycoon and Ski Resort Tycoon II. \nSki Resort Extreme puts the player in the shoes of a ski resort developer whose aim is to attract varied groups of skiers and snowboarders by catering to their needs and expectations, be it ski runs, equipment, entertainment or amenities. \nResorts may be started from scratch, with more or less money depending on the difficulty level. Alternatively, players may take challenges where the task is to fix the problems of an existing resort in a specified period of time. \nThe game also allows the player to create a terrain with the map editor, with the option to import one's own height map.","popularity":1,"games":[29173,55590,18623,44242,9199,55689,33603,11419,23345,36962],"tags":[268435469,268435471,536872060,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,3782],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":1101686400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1101686400000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Nov-29","y":2004,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dvc7yq8pkic3pcohdhdv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvc7yq8pkic3pcohdhdv","width":186,"height":270}}
