Players use pistols, rifles, machine guns, and shotguns to shoot and kill human enemies during frenetic combat. Players also use knives to slit the throats of wounded enemies, and in one sequence a villain shoots a prisoner at close range. Combat is highlighted by screams of pain and realistic gunfire; players earn extra points for performing headshots. Decapitation and blood-splatter effects occur frequently. The game includes a depiction of a drug labe with marijuana plants and cocaine. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d\u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.armyoftwo.com"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
