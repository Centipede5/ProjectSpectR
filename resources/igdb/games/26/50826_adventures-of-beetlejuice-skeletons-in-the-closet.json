It's an action game of sorts, in which you play Beetlejuice himself and you have to kill (?) all kinds of skeletons with weapons -- you start with the ability to shoot a single loogie at the skeletons and, by collecting bonuses from destroyed skeletons, you may get additional loogies per shot or completely different weapons. \n \nAlso, after you hit a skeleton, your friend Lidia has to collect the skeleton's remains with a vacuum cleaner; however, if a skeleton find Lidia she becomes imprisoned in a cage and you have to release her by hitting another skeleton and taking a \"lightning bonus\" from his remains. \n \nAnother nice touch is the worm, which comes out of the playground every now and then and, should it hit you, kills you.","collection":4770,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[72373,7344,10039,1968,117,55752,21062,7768,51485,8652],"tags":[1,268435464,536870928,536871980,536872419,536872617,536873064,536873327,536875050,536875054,536875075,536875081,536875147,536875151,536875396,536875485,536875511,536875675,536875822,536876010,536876185,536876377,536876493,536876584,536876943,536878061],"category":0,"keywords":[16,1068,1507,1705,2152,2415,4138,4142,4163,4169,4235,4239,4484,4573,4599,4763,4910,5098,5273,5465,5581,5672,6031,7149],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dx5mxv7gibjdiqjsqc3b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dx5mxv7gibjdiqjsqc3b","width":1000,"height":1486}}
