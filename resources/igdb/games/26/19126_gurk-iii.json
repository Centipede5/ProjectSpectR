The third installment in the series is a bigger adventure than ever before, with loads of new monsters and items, many with unique effects and abilities. Character classes are better-differentiated and combat tactics are more subtle and interesting without sacrificing the hack'n'slash ethos that Gurk fans adore. The dedication to 8-bit culture remains fervent, with the complete 20-song soundtrack rendered with analog synth emulators that will evoke the classic sounds of the game systems of the 1980s.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36792,23719,26163,1221,16468,37088,72412,13196,47823,55289],"tags":[17,268435468,268435487,1073741827],"developers":[9847],"game_engines":[339],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1375660800000,"platforms":[34],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1375660800000,"human":"2013-Aug-05","y":2013,"m":8}],"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/larvalabs.com\/"}]}
