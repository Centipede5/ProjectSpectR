In the game, players will be training with no-nonsense boxing coach Simon, throwing different punch combos at the pads on his hands by for example tapping to throw a jab or swiping to throw a hook. Learn, memorise and repeat the combos before coach Simon\u2019s patience runs out, with combinations becoming increasingly difficult for the ultimate brain challenge!","storyline":"Punch Perfect is a memory and reaction boxing game built around the logic of \u2018Simon Says\u2019. The game was launched in October 2018 and first presented at \u201cResonate\u201d, a gaming exposition in Glasgow, Scotland. In the game, players will be training with no-nonsense boxing coach Simon, throwing different punch combos at the pads on his hands by for example tapping to throw a jab or swiping to throw a hook. With continuously incrementing sequences and increasing speed, the game quickly becomes a real challenge, allowing you to effectively train your memory, reactions and coordination while playing. Punch Perfect is the first of many more original games that indie game studio Handprint Games is hoping to release in the coming years.","popularity":1,"games":[10039,17548,15851,102134,22690,101257,65832,90101,37419,80916],"tags":[1,27,34,268435460,268435470,268435488,268435489,536871019,536871544,536872078,536872556,536872929,536875225,536875360,536876835,536877943,536878403,536887609,536891202,536894274,536894275,1073741825],"developers":[16957],"game_engines":[603],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[107,632,1166,1644,2017,4313,4448,5923,7031,7491,16697,20290,23362,23363],"themes":[1,27,34],"genres":[4,14,32,33],"first_release_date":1543363200000,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1543363200000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Nov-28","y":2018,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1543363200000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Nov-28","y":2018,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5q8p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5q8p","width":682,"height":1388},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5q8o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5q8o","width":682,"height":1392}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"Ceci18RT6xQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hoe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hoe","width":4207,"height":4207},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=handprintgames.punchperfect"},{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/gb\/app\/punch-perfect-boxing-training\/id1438535801?mt=8"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/handprintgames"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/HandprintGames"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/handprintgames"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/handprintgames.com\/"}]}
