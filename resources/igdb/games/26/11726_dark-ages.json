{"id":11726,"name":"Dark Ages","slug":"dark-ages","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/dark-ages","created_at":1439989963900,"updated_at":1523421771152,"summary":"Dark Ages is a platform game written for MS-DOS, published by Apogee Software. It was the first shareware game to feature support for the AdLib sound card.\n\nDark Ages was distributed as shareware. It consists of three episodes, with only the first episode playable in the shareware version. The episodes are:\nPrince of Destiny\nThe Undead Kingdom\nDungeons of Doom\n\nThe game was released as freeware on March 20, 2009.\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nDark Ages is a side scrolling game where the player's alter ego, the prince, can move sideways, jump and shoot. Game play involves killing and avoiding enemies and jumping over obstacles. Progression to the next level often involves a hidden door, revealed by one of several Wise Men type characters after retrieving an item for them. The items include a key, a shield, and an apple.\n\nThe player can use magic to fight the prince's enemies, starting out with a simple energy bolt and slowly gaining access to more destructive spells as the game progresses. There are three spells in the game: a blue bolt that flies straight forward, a boomerang that flies forward then returns allowing enemies to be hit twice, and a magic beam with a shorter range but can kill most enemies in one hit and can be fired in rapid succession.","storyline":"The player controls the prince and heir to the land\u2019s greatest kingdom (referred to as the Great Kingdom). When the prince was a child, Garth, a power hungry wizard of immense power and greed, killed his father and took the throne. Rather than kill the prince he sent him to be raised by peasants, but even Garth\u2019s evil magic could not foresee his mistake, since the very peasant he delivered him to was once the Kingdom\u2019s greatest hero, and as the prince grew he was taught the ways of a master fighter. One of the things he learned well was how to use magic as a weapon.\n\nIn the years after Garth\u2019s conquest, the kingdom had fallen into ruin and despair, with no hope of returning to the times of happiness and prosperity. Garth ruled with an iron fist and terrorized the population with undead creatures.\n\nThe player's quest is to find Garth and rescue the Kingdom from the Dark Ages it\u2019s trapped in. The difficult journey takes the player through badlands, castles, dungeons, caves, forests and finally to the Great Kingdom itself, with Garth\u2019s army of undead creatures attacking at every turn.\n\nThe final episode ends with a confrontation between the prince and Garth. After killing Garth, the prince's destiny is fulfilled, having freed the kingdom from the Dark Ages of fear and tyranny. The prince assumes his rightful place as the peaceful King and Leader of the Kingdom. The Great Kingdom is once again free to prosper and grow without fear.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[7344,55752,117,36926,26766,12597,16326,6705,1352,2547],"tags":[1,22,268435464,536871138,536871170,536871208,536871213,536871470,536871931,536871938,536871971,536872010,536872064,536872287,536872689,536872690,536872961,536873064,536875073,536875081,536875083,536875096,536875130,536875147,536875151,536875231,536875309,536875396,536875472,536875606,536875689,536875702,536875822,536875903,536876015,536876031,536876205,536876493,536876619,536876713,536876862,536878147,536878192,536878217,536878600,1073741828],"publishers":[188],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[226,258,296,301,558,1019,1026,1059,1098,1152,1375,1777,1778,2049,2152,4161,4169,4171,4184,4218,4235,4239,4319,4397,4484,4560,4694,4777,4790,4910,4991,5103,5119,5293,5581,5707,5801,5950,7235,7280,7305,7688],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bgybfhkrki8j7izh7grt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bgybfhkrki8j7izh7grt","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hzlncwkw5f0kgbwxsfu9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hzlncwkw5f0kgbwxsfu9","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fa8upxgkfq2zuoaqpuai.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fa8upxgkfq2zuoaqpuai","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nlferigyk9ebgfbw8m0g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nlferigyk9ebgfbw8m0g","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ceddro8qlagc6gqvvsit.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ceddro8qlagc6gqvvsit","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"i9fmuPqn1hY"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bqpxlzjgliv4h9cjii4u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bqpxlzjgliv4h9cjii4u","width":640,"height":480},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/358440"}],"external":{"steam":"358440"}}
