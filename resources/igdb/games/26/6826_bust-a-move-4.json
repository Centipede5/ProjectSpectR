The game is also the final title to be recognizably similar in presentation to the original.\n\nBuilding upon the success of Puzzle Bobble 3, the game adds a pulley system that requires two sets of bubbles, attached to either side of a rope hanging across two pulleys. The game contains a story mode for single player play.\n\nIn total, the game features 640 levels. The console version features a level editor to either create and save a level, set a succession of levels, or to create an unlimited amount of extra levels and stages. It also has an alternative \"story mode\".","collection":712,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[24426,56033,26223,20329,20342,19241,55173,80916,54775,11367],"tags":[1,35,268435465,536870916,536871208,536871881,536873064,536873787,536875020,536875198,536875284,536875379,536875489,536875678,536876240,536876973,536877854,536888127,536888299,536888348,536889634,536891356,536893629,1073741828],"developers":[74],"publishers":[817],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[4,296,969,2152,2875,4108,4286,4372,4467,4577,4766,5328,6061,6942,17215,17387,17436,18722,20444,22717],"themes":[1,35],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":902361600000,"platforms":[52,6,22,7,23],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":915062400000,"region":5,"human":"1998","y":1998,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":902361600000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Aug-06","y":1998,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":909792000000,"region":2,"human":"1998-Oct-31","y":1998,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":924134400000,"region":1,"human":"1999-Apr-15","y":1999,"m":4},{"category":1,"platform":22,"date":928195200000,"region":2,"human":"1999-Jun","y":1999,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":956880000000,"region":5,"human":"2000-Apr-28","y":2000,"m":4},{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":946684800000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Jan","y":2000,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":953164800000,"region":5,"human":"2000-Mar-16","y":2000,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":959731200000,"region":2,"human":"2000-May-31","y":2000,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":960508800000,"region":1,"human":"2000-Jun-09","y":2000,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Simple 1500 Series Vol. 93: The Puzzle Bobble - Puzzle Bobble 4","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Puzzle Bobble 4","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tw8icqb7oigljnnbs4ra.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tw8icqb7oigljnnbs4ra","width":320,"height":240}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ozsx8cykgigebesddkc5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ozsx8cykgigebesddkc5","width":640,"height":621},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Puzzle_Bobble_4"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/bubblebobble.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bust-A-Move_4"}]}
