Ninja-kun can also acquire scrolls that briefly give him stronger attacks, like a fire burst that takes out all nearby enemies. \n \nEach stage (or \"scene\") has a different layout, with some being merely a single screen (such as Scene 1) as well as larger vertically- and horizontally-scrolling stages. The enemies are usually different too, with increasing difficulty.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
