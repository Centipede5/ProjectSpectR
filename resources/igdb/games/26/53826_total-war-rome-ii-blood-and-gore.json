Featuring hundreds of gruesome animations that play out in combat between multiple different unit types, the massed battles of Total War: ROME II will never be the same again. \n \nEmploying a more refined particle system than Shogun 2, Blood & Gore for ROME II looks and feels grittier and more brutal. Gore coats combatants, the ground will become soaked with blood, and you\u2019ll hear every stab, slash and impact with bespoke new sound effects.","collection":4253,"franchise":977,"franchises":[977],"popularity":2,"game":2359,"games":[30229,55036,32510,36553,55029,83728,26391,26940,23345,30457],"tags":[22,39,41,268435472,536870914,536873940,536874427,536874694,1073741827],"developers":[111],"publishers":[4468],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[2,3028,3515,3782],"themes":[22,39,41],"genres":[16],"first_release_date":1383177600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1383177600000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Oct-31","y":2013,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ex56rcu83c9o0goaergo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ex56rcu83c9o0goaergo","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iza7hiujlmmrwlsjlcyo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iza7hiujlmmrwlsjlcyo","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"nkGIv1p_e5M"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pk0fx3gvqdi8wajfhwl7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pk0fx3gvqdi8wajfhwl7","width":500,"height":500},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Total_War:_Rome_II#Add-on_packs"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/wiki.totalwar.com\/w\/Total_War_Rome_II"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
