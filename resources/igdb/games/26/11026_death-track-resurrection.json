Players drive vehicles armed with machine guns, rockets, lasers, and mines through urban landscapes and race courses. Players earn cash rewards for outpacing opponents and destroying their vehicles. Laser and gunfire, explosions, and car crashes can be seen and heard throughout the game. Cutscenes sometimes depict female characters wearing tight, provocative outfits that expose a lot of cleavage. The word sh*t is occasionally heard in dialogue.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe presence of alcohol and tobacco is both explicit and heavily implied. For the tobacco, a cutscene depicts four separate images of cigarettes close-up on a table. As for alcohol (never explicitly named), the same scene shows a clear liquid being poured from a liquor-shaped bottle. This cutscene is stylized such that players can infer the bottle's contents: frayed cigarette butts, portioned ritualistic serving, a 'machine-powering-down' sound effect, screen blurring.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence\r\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/7840"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Death_Track:_Resurrection"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.1cpublishing.eu\/game\/death-track-resurrection"}],"external":{"steam":"7840"}}
