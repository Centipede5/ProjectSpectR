The premise of the game is that V.E.N.O.M. have propelled Boulder Hill into a time vortex, and the player must rescue the other members of the M.A.S.K. team by collecting and re-assembling parts of a scan key, which then directs the player to the location of the missing personnel. The game received mostly favorable reviews at the time, although it was noted by some that the tie-in to the franchise was quite tenuous and only the graphics, rather than the storyline and gameplay, connected it to the M.A.S.K. franchise.","collection":2846,"franchise":1040,"franchises":[1040],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,27314,71455,25300,142,11253,10039],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871037,536871882,536872360,1073741827],"developers":[3212],"publishers":[3212],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[125,970,1448],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987-Dec-31","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Mobile Armored Strike Kommand","comment":"Other"},{"name":"MASK"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gzbmcekryjupnn8bjmfo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gzbmcekryjupnn8bjmfo","width":1000,"height":1276}}
