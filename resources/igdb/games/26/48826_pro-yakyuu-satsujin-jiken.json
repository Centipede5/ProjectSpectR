It was developed and published by Capcom in Japan only. \n \nPro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! (\"Pro Baseball? Murder Case!\") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops. \n \nThis game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.","popularity":1,"games":[13189,15911,25222,22425,76098,41895,60,11423,55803,11296],"tags":[27,268435487,536871078,536871133,536871262,536871325,536871939,536872581,536875141,536875570],"category":0,"keywords":[166,221,350,413,1027,1669,4229,4658],"themes":[27],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":598924800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":598924800000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Dec-24","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":601603200000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Jan-24","y":1989,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k1rmoyd0sofxyasa0mcl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k1rmoyd0sofxyasa0mcl","width":296,"height":205}}
