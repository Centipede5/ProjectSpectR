It is shown from a top-down perspective and all units are represented by icons on the square fields of the playing map. The basic gameplay is simple: on each of the four levels there are goals to fulfill, e.g. destroying pirate ships. To do so, the player chooses a unit and gives it the order to move somewhere. When hostile units meet, they fight automatically; the fights are shown in separate windows.","collection":857,"popularity":1,"games":[55036,23345,2015,24512,18623,29173,2617,26391,55590,19376],"tags":[22,268435471,536871205,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[293,3782],"themes":[22],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":662688000000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":29,"date":662688000000,"human":"1991-Jan","y":1991,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/unxed1cqoybmlfwwnlqb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"unxed1cqoybmlfwwnlqb","width":640,"height":877}}
