The core systems are scorched and broken and the world beyond the BARATHA DIVIDE, a vast and treacherous expanse of nothing, is an alien mystery.\n\nBrick M. Stonewood (the \u201cM\u201d stands for \u201cMetal\u201d) is a remnant of an older time. A time where men were men and truth spilled at 60km\/s from the barrel of a gun.\n\nFound by ingot miners in sleep-lock, drifting in a LOKATT MKII DSP eject pod and revived at the Holloway-Exeter Station, Brick is a man driven to unlock the secrets of his past and the strange mysteries that lie just beyond the Divide; a specialist with a ceramic alloy steed, the Starr Wolf, and a fate to make among the stars.\n\nThe Holloway-Exeter is a frontier town packed into spinning ringed cylinder orbiting the fourth moon of the third planet of a dying star; a great place for a mercenary pilot like Brick to find himself at the pointy end of some clatter and sin.\n\nThen there\u2019s the girl. There\u2019s always a girl.","collection":3479,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19448,27314,36950,19301,68287,6732,11253,25300,19174,20918],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487,536871029,536871078,536871756,536871882,536871939,536871971,536875046,536875783,536875794,536876291,1073741828],"developers":[7419],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[117,166,844,970,1027,1059,4134,4871,4882,5379],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,31],"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":14,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":3,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dmwjdzdcd4lbnmgdha6n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dmwjdzdcd4lbnmgdha6n","width":640,"height":479},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/prxrhnbjwxiw527biuq5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"prxrhnbjwxiw527biuq5","width":640,"height":479},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iyix2icn7qmlus0ofhdf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iyix2icn7qmlus0ofhdf","width":640,"height":479},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vujvb4dc6i0sws4synij.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vujvb4dc6i0sws4synij","width":640,"height":479},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yuljn5dyksqbp8ch4hnn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yuljn5dyksqbp8ch4hnn","width":640,"height":479}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qq6ir67zwkdldohhhq1z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qq6ir67zwkdldohhhq1z","width":800,"height":1105},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.starrmazer.com\/"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/starrmazer"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/starrmazer"}]}
