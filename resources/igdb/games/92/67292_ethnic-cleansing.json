As part of a \"Race War\", the player controls a neo-Nazi or a Klansman and is tasked with killing stereotypical African-American, Latino, and Jewish enemies, ending with former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. \n \nUsing the Genesis3D engine, the National Alliance created the game to be provocative and to support their white supremacist message. The game has been controversial, with the Anti-Defamation League taking particular issue; it has been ranked several times as one of the most controversial games ever created. It was planned to be followed by a long line of sequels, but only one, titled White Law, has been released.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[536,19441,7768,3042,6801,28302,2031,27314,11270,21599],"tags":[268435461,536871041,536871365,536871506,536872014,536872695,536872799,536872800,536873111,536873352,536873362,536874947,536875058,536875081,536875089,536875095,536875151,536875199,536875242,536875271,536875358,536875362,536875364,536875448,536875511,536875537,536875650,536875743,536875745,536875750,536875804,536875822,536875904,536876073,536876199,536876287,536876332,536876495,536876502,536876505,536876554,536876642,536877183,536877672,536877740,536877928,536878017,536878031,1073741825],"developers":[13573],"publishers":[13574],"game_engines":[511],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[129,453,594,1102,1783,1887,1888,2199,2440,2450,4035,4146,4169,4177,4183,4239,4287,4330,4359,4446,4450,4452,4536,4599,4625,4738,4831,4833,4838,4892,4910,4992,5161,5287,5375,5420,5583,5590,5593,5642,5730,6271,6760,6828,7016,7105,7119],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1011571200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1011571200000,"human":"2002-Jan-21","y":2002,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mfkezgai4ulo4wx97jid.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mfkezgai4ulo4wx97jid","width":429,"height":241}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yelh8ygwvplhzriqorpj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yelh8ygwvplhzriqorpj","width":275,"height":154},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ethnic_Cleansing_(video_game)"}]}
