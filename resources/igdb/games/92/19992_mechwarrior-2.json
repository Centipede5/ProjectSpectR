The game features eight brand new missions and 32 reworked versions of popular PC campaigns. At the outset of the game you can choose between the Wolf Clan and Jade Falcon squads, or opt for the \"instant action\" feature to jump right into the fray. \n\nNo matter which route you take, be ready for some explosive action, as every mission calls for you to destroy something. The emphasis in the PlayStation version is shoot-\u00bfem-up action, but fans of the PC version will still be able to trick out their mechanical monster to their heart's content. If you love mech games or you just want to deal out some damage, then you should check this game out.","collection":144,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"category":0,"first_release_date":824774400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":824774400000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-20","y":1996,"m":2}]}
