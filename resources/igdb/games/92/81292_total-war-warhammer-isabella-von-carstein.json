In addition, Vlad has been removed from the Vampire Counts faction select screen, and may now also be chosen to lead a Von Carstein campaign.","storyline":"In life, the daughter of Sylvania\u2019s mad count Otto Von Drak was much like any other of her noble counterparts: vain, immoral and selfish. \n \nUpon her father\u2019s death, the first and greatest of the Vampire counts, Vlad Von Carstein, seized the reigns of the province, and was duly married to Isabella. She was soon drawn to Vlad\u2019s intense charisma, and he in turn came to rely upon her unquestioning support and devotion absolutely; what began as a marriage of convenience transformed into a partnership of legend. As she lay dying from a wasting disease, Vlad granted her the Blood Kiss, and she joined him in eternal undeath. \n \nNow, Isabella is a powerful Vampire in her own right, and may be seen stalking the front lines bearing the Blood Chalice of Bathori. When she joins Vlad on the same battlefield, their combat prowess is multiplied, each standing shoulder to shoulder with their beloved in death!","collection":2651,"franchise":977,"franchises":[977,509],"popularity":1,"game":9898,"games":[],"tags":[536874009],"developers":[111],"publishers":[23,112],"category":1,"keywords":[3097],"first_release_date":1488240000000,"platforms":[6,92,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1488240000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Feb-28","y":2017,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1488240000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Feb-28","y":2017,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1488240000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Feb-28","y":2017,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1488240000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Feb-28","y":2017,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mfmelqxg7loxgfq08vg1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mfmelqxg7loxgfq08vg1","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r66tjl0i94otaha5nl6p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r66tjl0i94otaha5nl6p","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/otz1xp2odvezbzmzc7yp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"otz1xp2odvezbzmzc7yp","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y4r1nukd21octx1mubzh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y4r1nukd21octx1mubzh","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"XetTBjCw6TU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/epo1m4pr0mpfuhyuew1b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"epo1m4pr0mpfuhyuew1b","width":756,"height":1080},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/455041\/Total_War_WARHAMMER__Isabella_von_Carstein"}]}
