The platformer-style game was released in 1991 for MS-DOS. It was subsequently ported to a number of other platforms, including the Amiga, Atari ST, and NES.","storyline":"The object of the game is to evade police in order to make it to a blues concert. Player(s) can take control of either Jake or Elwood Blues. Each level is a variation on the jumping theme, with the characters finding a necessary attribute (e.g. a guitar) somewhere in the level. The sixth and final level ends on-stage.","franchise":724,"franchises":[724],"rating":68.85853469907241,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":68.85853469907241,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":7,"games":[33269,20342,24426,3977,19150,23852,55173,10039,19001,56033],"tags":[1,27,268435464,536871262,536872198,536872961,536875054,536875294,536877334,536880048,1073741828],"developers":[1404],"publishers":[1404],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[350,1286,2049,4142,4382,6422,9136],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[63,13,16,15,25,33,18],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":1,"platform":18,"date":715305600000,"human":"1992-Sep","y":1992,"m":9},{"category":2,"platform":33,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bq1wxyj3zssovcycjyrm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bq1wxyj3zssovcycjyrm","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/puvcfgorqijf93ubam8h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"puvcfgorqijf93ubam8h","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/te18yi7qc39yst9apqe6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"te18yi7qc39yst9apqe6","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ppwb1vgmykaleynoylmd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ppwb1vgmykaleynoylmd","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"Qt7XN0lQgB8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ev82ujsepoanaiod7vvr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ev82ujsepoanaiod7vvr","width":225,"height":224},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Blues_Brothers_(video_game)"}]}
