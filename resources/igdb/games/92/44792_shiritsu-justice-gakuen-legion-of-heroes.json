Control wise, the game varies from other Capcom fighting games by only having four buttons (two punches and two kicks, which is closer to the SNK game format) rather than the standard six. A player chooses a team of two characters, and fights against another two character team.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":904435200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":904435200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Aug-30","y":1998,"m":8}]}
