This game was only ever released in Japan for the Famicom and was never translated from the original Japanese language. \n \nThe player takes control of a five member team of special anti-terrorist agents as they break into a building where a hostage situation is taking place. Their goal is to take out the villains and free the hostages. Battles with gunmen take place in a traditional RPG style turn-based battle. Players enter the commands for each surviving member of the team, including what weapon to attack with, and which target to attack. When not in battle, the player views the building in a traditional 3D dungeon perspective, moving through the hallways, choosing which rooms to investigate, which traps to disarm, and how to proceed to the end of the game within a given time limit.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,16468,12632,25300,36926,59516,55289,25311,28010,37088],"tags":[1,268435468,536871938,536872581,536875222,536875358],"category":0,"keywords":[1026,1669,4310,4446],"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":560908800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":560908800000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Oct-11","y":1987,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/chldpgw4dv492tzrhiso.jpg","cloudinary_id":"chldpgw4dv492tzrhiso","width":640,"height":443}}
