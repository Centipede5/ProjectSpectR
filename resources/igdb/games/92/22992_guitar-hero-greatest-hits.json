The game was developed by Beenox, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane for release on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 systems and was released around the world in the second half of June 2009. \n \nThe game reuses many elements from previous titles in the series, including Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero: Metallica. Beenox designed the game around playing the greatest songs of the series at venues located in the greatest places on Earth, and created venues based on various Wonders of the World for the game. While the game's soundtrack and expansion into a four-player band were well received by reviewers, the game was highly criticized for being a full-cost standalone title instead of being downloadable content for existing games in the series.","collection":284,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[28465,44242,34919,33603,36962,55888,65827,43130,28277,32283],"tags":[40,268435463,268435469,268435489],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[40],"genres":[7,13,33],"first_release_date":1245110400000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1245974400000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Jun-26","y":2009,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1245801600000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Jun-24","y":2009,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1245110400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Jun-16","y":2009,"m":6}]}
