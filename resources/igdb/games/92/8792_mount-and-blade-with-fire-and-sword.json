Players explore 'open-world' environments as they complete quests, forge alliances, and battle enemy forces. Players use swords, axes, spears, muskets, and catapults to defeat enemy troops in hand-to-hand combat. Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, sword-slashing effects, cries of pain, and brief splashes of blood; bloodstains sometimes appear on characters' clothing and\/or armor. During the course of the game, the dialogue occasionally references suggestive material (e.g., '[W]henever her husband is away, she beds her stable boys and anyone else she can lay her hands on' and 'Our priest gave communion to two women from our parish\u2014whole night long.'). Some dialogue also references drugs or alcohol (e.g., 'Yesterday a merchant got too high on hashish,' 'Drink some of this vodka, and your sorrows will be gone,' and 'Students got in a drunken brawl at the inn again.'). The words 'sh*t,' 'b*tch,' and 'bastard' appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.taleworlds.com\/en\/Games\/FireAndSword"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/48720"}],"external":{"steam":"48720"}}
