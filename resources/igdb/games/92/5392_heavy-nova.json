It was ported to the Sega Mega-CD as one of the system's two launch titles (the other being Wolf Team's Sol-Feace); the Mega-CD port was not released outside Japan. Micronet subsequently ported it to the Sega Mega Drive for an American release in 1992. \n \nYou play as a giant mech beating up other mechs of various sizes. A punches and B kicks. Up rockets up for as long as the button is held; you will eventually come back down.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,17548,28175,90101,76885,55038,37032,1626,68287,26820],"tags":[1,268435460,268435464,536870915,536871019,536871882,536872009,536873874,536875435,536875437,536875871,536876437],"developers":[2365],"publishers":[2383],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3,107,970,1097,2962,4523,4525,4959,5525],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4,8],"first_release_date":692496000000,"platforms":[29,78,77],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":78,"date":692496000000,"human":"1991-Dec-12","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":77,"date":702864000000,"human":"1992-Apr-10","y":1992,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":702864000000,"human":"1992-Apr-10","y":1992,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f0wsmgisr6bp7xrsgjbj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f0wsmgisr6bp7xrsgjbj","width":250,"height":345}}
