New commentary was recorded and some Premiership historical data was included. All remaining aspects of the game were unchanged or just tweaked. \n \nThe rest of the game is well known to fans of the genre - it was the first fully polygonal football game on the market, which allowed an unprecedented graphical realism and (technically) unlimited camera angles.","collection":369,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":1988,"games":[15851,103377,106814,100359,30830,96209,25962,28862,42359,27081],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536870939,536872078,536872399,536875181,536875433,536875562,536875749,536876259,536877432,536878125,1073741826],"developers":[578],"publishers":[578],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[26,27,1166,1487,4269,4521,4650,4837,5347,6520,7213],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":828057600000,"platforms":[32,19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":828057600000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Mar-29","y":1996,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":851904000000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Dec-30","y":1996,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/znkyqutpefrun8i06xvo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"znkyqutpefrun8i06xvo","width":1575,"height":1964},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Actua_Soccer"}]}
