Along the way you can upgrade your ship in shops, if you collect enough coins from destroyed enemies.","collection":2092,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68324,76246,19341,10039,68287,32902,68142,28751,47823],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871208,1073741828],"developers":[4009],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[166,296],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":679881600000,"platforms":[35],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":35,"date":694137600000,"region":1,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":35,"date":694137600000,"region":2,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":679881600000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Jul-19","y":1991,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b8\u30fc\u30be\u30fc\u30f3Gear \u30aa\u30d1\u30aa\u30d1Jr.\u306e\u5192\u967a","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nxx2leyixny6fkz5p7bv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nxx2leyixny6fkz5p7bv","width":1300,"height":1822}}
