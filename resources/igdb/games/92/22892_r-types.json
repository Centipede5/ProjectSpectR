First, your progress through the game is saved at the start of each level, so you don't have to start from scratch every time. Second, you now have unlimited continues. \n \nR-Types also contains a small library section which describes some of the story behind the R-Type universe, and lets you browse some of the in-game graphics. Other bonuses include an FMV intro movie and ending movies.","collection":1391,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":61,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":61,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[68287,36950,10209,27314,28029,64204,10213,26766,71455,25300],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871859,536871882,536871971,536875284,536876633,536877744],"category":0,"keywords":[166,947,970,1059,4372,5721,6832],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":922579200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":922579200000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Mar-28","y":1999,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dbeigob8vedtcqegac9a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dbeigob8vedtcqegac9a","width":165,"height":193},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
