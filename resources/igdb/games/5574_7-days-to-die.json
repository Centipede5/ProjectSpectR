{"id":5574,"name":"7 Days to Die","slug":"7-days-to-die","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/7-days-to-die","created_at":1394851721036,"updated_at":1540400898135,"summary":"Building on survivalist and horror themes, players in 7 Days to Die can scavenge the abandoned cities of the buildable and destructable voxel world for supplies or explore the wilderness to gather raw materials to build their own tools, weapons, traps, fortifications and shelters. The horror (zombies) element makes up a large part of the game, including building and the fully destructible (voxel) environment - everything is built from blocks, similar to Minecraft, yet creating a very smooth look. \n \nWith steady updates (but slow, avg. 2 major updates \/ year, with several minor ones in-between, mostly bug fixes) the game has steadily advanced and continues to advance in terms of graphics but even more so and more importantly, gameplay, having changed from being a mostly simple shooter and focused on elaborate crafting (changed with Alpha 12), to a full RPG experience, with Alpha 15 having introduced NPCs (traders only) and an extensive skill system and Alpha 17 introduced this as a categorized (traits-like) system. \n \nThe game now also has an extensive traps, automated turrets via an electricity tier, plus a whole assortment of usable single- and multi-seating vehicles (manual and motor bikes, cars, gyrocopter) introduced in Alpha 17. \n \nThe game can be played single-player (SP), multi-player (MP), co-op \/ PvE and PvP; game servers can be run either via the game client, or as a dedicated server with extensive configurability and number of modifications possible, including custom blocks and sounds, plus an event system, which created an active \"modding\" community and allows to experience the game in many different ways that were initially not intended.","storyline":"* As of this writing, a full story has not been implemented yet (Early Access \/ Alpha development status), this is preliminary. * \n \nYou awaken with only a bare minimum of clothes on you, some canned food, glass of water and only your bare knuckles to defend yourself - time to get creative by scavenging for rocks, wood, plant fiber and bones, to make primitive tools (stone axe, stone shovel, shiv), basic weapons (wooden club, bow and arrows) and simple clothing made from plants and a sleeping bag. Venture the lands to find weapons, building resources and cooking tools, hunt and gather for food, process down hide into leather and start making a forge and start crafting metal objects. \n \nHow this will play out in the long run is up to you - survive and even thrive, or perish at the infested claws and teeth of the undead, but also harsh environment can be your demise. \n \nBeware of the 7th night though, with the blood moon shining the undead will rise in masses and will be stronger, faster and more aggressive. Make haste, prepare for this event so you can survive, rebuild, expand and survive another week!","rating":65.0811974635337,"popularity":13,"aggregated_rating":36.125,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":50.60309873176685,"total_rating_count":32,"rating_count":23,"games":[5573,19249,1905,44076,19561,26145,5447,9243,24765,17379],"tags":[1,19,21,33,268435461,268435468,268435469,268435471,268435487,268435488,536870917,536870981,536870984,536871029,536871033,536871086,536871251,536871304,536871338,536871365,536871378,536871422,536871452,536871507,536871945,536872032,536872060,536872371,536872647,536872748,536873364,536874694,536874834,536875071,536875159,536875276,536875331,536875483,536875484,536875517,536875668,536875807,536875869,536875887,536876261,536876262,536876263,536876264,536876265,536881831,1073741826,1073741831,1073741825],"developers":[2474,2121],"publishers":[2474,294],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2,7],"game_modes":[1,2,3,4],"keywords":[5,69,72,117,121,174,339,392,426,453,466,510,540,595,1033,1120,1148,1459,1735,1836,2452,3782,3922,4159,4247,4364,4419,4571,4572,4605,4756,4895,4957,4975,5349,5350,5351,5352,5353,10919],"themes":[1,19,21,33],"genres":[5,12,13,15,31,32],"first_release_date":1386892800000,"status":4,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[6,14,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1467072000000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Jun-28","y":2016,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1467331200000,"region":1,"human":"2016-Jul-01","y":2016,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1467072000000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Jun-28","y":2016,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1386892800000,"human":"2013-Dec-13","y":2013,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1386892800000,"human":"2013-Dec-13","y":2013,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1467072000000,"human":"2016-Jun-28","y":2016,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1467072000000,"human":"2016-Jun-28","y":2016,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qdkkwdm32tomngxmm2ci.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qdkkwdm32tomngxmm2ci","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bcclznivazwmu1zcuhbj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bcclznivazwmu1zcuhbj","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zsps0veeqpn6sod53lxb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zsps0veeqpn6sod53lxb","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jbsbapnokm1cst68cfd6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jbsbapnokm1cst68cfd6","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r6hhvtaozowkcf06bswz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r6hhvtaozowkcf06bswz","width":1920,"height":1200}],"videos":[{"name":"Game historical development","video_id":"8LjlZ4E3uh4"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"dBBoF_GRKOQ"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"T7XmMwxk3rI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mgjzdiufgeuyspy6uccd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mgjzdiufgeuyspy6uccd","width":399,"height":440},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/7daystodie"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/7_Days_to_Die"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.7daystodie.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/251570"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/7DaystoDie"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/7DaysToDie"}],"external":{"steam":"251570"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":100,"onlinemax":100},{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":4,"offlinemax":2}]}
