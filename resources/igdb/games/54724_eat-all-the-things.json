{"id":54724,"name":"Eat All The Things","slug":"eat-all-the-things","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/eat-all-the-things","created_at":1502968573629,"updated_at":1532077423427,"summary":"Eat All The Thing is a 3D platformer with a stealth element. Eat all the things without getting caught! Targetting Nintendo Switch, PC, Mac, Linux, and Android.","storyline":"Eat All The Things You play as Bronut, a little guy who loves food so much he's dressed himself up as a donut. His love for food means he just can't help himself, whether the food belongs to him or not. \n \nNavigate many vibrant levels and help Bronut eat all the things! It's not all smooth eating though - beware of the watcher and the evil host! They're not really evil of course, after all it's their food... but anything that gets between Bronut and his treats is the enemy! \n \nThe watcher keeps watch on the stage with a spotlight, avoid it at all costs! Otherwise, the evil host will be alerted of your location and you will have to run and hide! Don't get caught! Be sure to make use of terrain and objects to hide from the spotlight. \n \nAs it goes, Bronut doesn't count his macros... he puts on weight with each snack, making him larger and slower. But putting on the weight can work out in your favour! You can weigh down big switches, reach higher places, resist high-speed winds, and much more! Be sure to visit your local TABLET station to \"unload\" when you need to! \n \nAs you progress through the game you will encounter new and interesting foods, such as colder than cold ice creams and the sweetest of sweet doughnuts. These may give you side-effects such as brain freeze (enabling you to walk on lava), and a sugar rush (increased run speed and jump height).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19241,24426,103339,104235,37001,94054,33269,19289,94876,19520],"tags":[23,35,268435464,268435465,536871044,536871878,536871896,536872299,536872961,1073741826],"developers":[13301],"publishers":[13301],"game_engines":[404],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[132,966,984,1387,2049],"themes":[23,35],"genres":[8,9,31,32],"status":4,"platforms":[34,92,130],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":34,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":92,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":130,"region":8,"human":"TBD"}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"EAT Things","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jbxrv2hveat7udgx3mr3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jbxrv2hveat7udgx3mr3","width":400,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xorjlzc21l308kmtk8pm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xorjlzc21l308kmtk8pm","width":400,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d4u6orrubjsgjskviw0l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d4u6orrubjsgjskviw0l","width":400,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xq0ilfhhrvj0ztsyw12o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xq0ilfhhrvj0ztsyw12o","width":400,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ohrymrkakouivce2e44t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ohrymrkakouivce2e44t","width":400,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yehiptwqjaf6ha2jotfn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yehiptwqjaf6ha2jotfn","width":1024,"height":768},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/730290"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCirVYrU1xiCmSzbSZAgMGyw"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/eatallthe"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/EatAllThe"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/eatallthe"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.eatallthe.com"}],"external":{"steam":"730290"}}
