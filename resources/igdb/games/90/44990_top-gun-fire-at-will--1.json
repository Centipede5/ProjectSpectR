Not only does this baby come with all the necessary tools and equipment needed for survival (radar, warning lights, altitude meters), it comes with a variety of missiles; there are standard air-to-air missiles, the air-to-ground AGMs, U238s made from depleted uranium, a disastrous Nuke, and the multiple target MIRV. It also comes with some defensive tools such as chaffs and flares that trick enemy radar. \n \nDon't worry, you're not going in the air alone! Merlin will act as your Radar Intercept Officer; loosely translated, he's the guy that sits behind you and watches out for enemy target locks. Additionally, the sweetly calm Raven and your arch rival Stinger will assist Maverick as his wingmen. When you get in a sticky situation, count on these guys to help you out!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[5,13],"first_release_date":836179200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":836179200000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Jul-01","y":1996,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uncgi3qwhlruj79ksktk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uncgi3qwhlruj79ksktk","width":1405,"height":1417}}
