Several games depict 2D arcade-style gameplay and graphics. One horror-themed game (Splatterhouse) depicts a slasher-character using meat cleavers, chainsaws, and shotguns to kill fantasy creatures (e.g., zombies, ghouls); in some environments, creatures appear with red blood drips\/splatters, and a handful of enemies can be decapitated or dismembered. A spy game (Rolling Thunder 2) depicts a stylized image of a nude woman covered in blue silhouette; while the outline of her breasts are visible, there are no discernible details (i.e., no nipples).","rating":5}}
