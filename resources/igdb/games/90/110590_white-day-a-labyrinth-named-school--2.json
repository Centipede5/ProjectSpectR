Finding himself locked up soon after entering, escaping the school now becomes the main objective.","storyline":"White Day is a fear-inducing, horror-survival game viewed, for the first time ever in this genre, completely from a first-person perspective. It unfolds like a movie. The player becomes a love-sick teenager entering the local school late at night to return his dream girl's diary, which she lost earlier in the day, and to drop off a token of affection; White Day candy. \n \nPlayers are introduced to two of the central characters, talking about ghost stories, in one of the school's many haunted corridors. It isn't long before the first problem of disabling the school alarm system becomes a priority. During this challenge the game takes a very dark turn, as you encounter the janitor, a man with a baseball bat, and hear sounds of the young, and decidedly spooky children laugh. \n \nThere are no weapons in White Day, but many ingenious puzzles litter the way: the player disables alarm systems, opens combination safes and rescues trapped school kids from weird apparitions. The difficulty setting helps the player to get into the story while providing a harder challenge at every turn.","collection":2882,"franchise":494,"franchises":[494],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":26914,"games":[55282,36334,27266,109455,25646,13189,18020,19817,103312,102584],"tags":[19,268435487,536870928,536872182,1073741825],"developers":[16704],"publishers":[16704],"game_engines":[600],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"keywords":[16,1270],"themes":[19],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":999648000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":999648000000,"region":7,"human":"2001-Sep-05","y":2001,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vpmganpdanfndqp47ex4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vpmganpdanfndqp47ex4","width":800,"height":451},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yon0mrlnp67775vz6ryn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yon0mrlnp67775vz6ryn","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"1rfyfhktPX8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xq2afria6hrnrctpnqj4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xq2afria6hrnrctpnqj4","width":220,"height":298},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/White_Day:_A_Labyrinth_Named_School"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
