Also, 383 aircraft stationed on Oahu were destroyed and 2,323 American service men lost their lives that day. The Japanese only lost 29 aircraft duringtheir attack on Pearl Harbour.\n\nYou now have the ability to re-write the history books. As a keen-eyed flak gunner, you will need to defend all sections of the naval base and shoot down Japanese Zeros attack in several waves and will also engage American Corsairs in air combat, so avoid shooting down your own air units in the heat of battle.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
