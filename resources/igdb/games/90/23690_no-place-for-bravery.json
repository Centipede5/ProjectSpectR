The idea is to use these events to craft the game\u2019s mythology. The game doesn't use regular exposition to tell it's story, rather, the player will absorb the nuances of Bravery\u2019s narrative by exploring its gorgeous environment, experiencing the aesthetics of its mechanics or by simply making sense of the vast array of mysterious random events. \n \nAlso, the game gets rid of all the grinding: Skinner Box mechanics and ''artificial'' stats-based progression have no place here: I'm talking about a game with absolutely no numbers and very, very few written words. \n \nNo Place for Bravery is an extremely hard and completely skill and strategy based game. The world is to be relentless, and the player feels the mediocrity before such a world in each step that is taken.\"","hypes":2,"popularity":12.66666666666667,"games":[80916,28070,47823,81249,25311,106987,26163,55038,29032,37419],"tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871197,536871489,536871490,536871717,536871738,536872341,536872609,536872617,536872879,1073741827],"developers":[10865],"publishers":[10865],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[285,577,578,805,826,1429,1697,1705,1967],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12,31,32],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"nuw66XndfOk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kmipjooigpu8zapgtyai.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kmipjooigpu8zapgtyai","width":1200,"height":675},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/noplaceforbravery.com\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BraveryGame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/braverygame\/"}]}
