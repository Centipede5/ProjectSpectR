Players turn their ships left and right and can spin them around quicker with the Fast Rotate button. Also, Zap, like the Superzapper on Tempest, will destroy everything onscreen and can only be used once per sector. \n \nThere are several different types and mannerisms of enemies as well as sectors. Getting rammed by an enemy will cause the player to lose a ship in reserve and the game will end once the player has no more remaining ships.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[28029,68287,36950,27314,64204,10039,25311,29525,10209,76229],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536873308,536875172,536875328,536875330,536875639,536876258,536880437,536882166,1073741827],"developers":[1138],"publishers":[1138],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[166,2396,4260,4416,4418,4727,5346,9525,11254],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[70],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":70,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u76hza6pgnffhntqcirt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u76hza6pgnffhntqcirt","width":378,"height":480}}
