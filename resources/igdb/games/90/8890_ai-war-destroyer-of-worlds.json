But draw too much attention to yourself, and the full might of the AI overlords will come crashing down. \n \nThe inattention of the larger AI is our only hope: a small resistance, too insignificant even to be noticed by the AI central command, has survived. These are the forces you will command. The AI subcommanders will fight you to the death when they see you -- but your glimmer of opportunity comes from quietly subduing those subcommanders without alerting central processing to the danger until it's too late.","collection":1206,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1408320000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1408320000000,"human":"2014-Aug-18","y":2014,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ajnwjhue4vfirmcfy5lm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ajnwjhue4vfirmcfy5lm","width":460,"height":215}}
