But there are other, somewhat unusual methods that rely on a quite different source \u2013 which is called magic. \n\nWhat if you could turn the esteemed Van Helsing into a totally different kind of monster hunter? Van Helsing: Thaumaturge DLC now allows you to play a specialist class that will surely spice up your gaming experience. The Thaumaturge is the master of the occult hunting traditions, an expert on the rare mystical arts. Forget the steel blades and those rude guns, and use purely your stunning arcane abilities.","popularity":1,"game":2638,"games":[78632,81249,80916,103501,101608,78149,1221,103282,76397,25311],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536871493,1073741827],"developers":[1243],"publishers":[1243],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[581],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1380153600000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1380153600000,"human":"2013-Sep-26","y":2013,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1380153600000,"human":"2013-Sep-26","y":2013,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vzpco35hxllstr6milsr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vzpco35hxllstr6milsr","width":600,"height":374},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.neocoregames.com\/games\/the-incredible-adventures-of-van-helsing\/overview\/"}]}
