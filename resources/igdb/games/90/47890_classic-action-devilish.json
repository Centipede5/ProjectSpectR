This retro title has been enhanced with the better graphics, gameplay and the ability to use both screens. If you're a fan of action pinball, this title is for you. Utilize the features of the DS to add a new element of fun and control to the game as you bounce your magical orb through the labyrinth both horizontally and vertically. Use the shoulder buttons to rotate your paddles to shoot your orb in any direction. Find and utilize various power-ups throughout your journey to aid you in your fight against evil. There is a total of 5 levels (with several sub-levels within each) with new and unique challenges and varying environments. Each level has a unique end boss that must be defeated to continue. The game automatically saves your progress so you can come back and play (replay) a level at anytime.","collection":4561,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,25646,26914,11296,12579,47823,28289,29525,28148,44076],"tags":[1,19,268435487,536871208,536871939,536872032,536875071],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1027,1120,4159],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1181347200000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1181347200000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Jun-09","y":2007,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Devilish\nDevilish 2\nDevilish: Ball Bounder","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yangxyl3ingpmsejmr7g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yangxyl3ingpmsejmr7g","width":450,"height":404},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
