Those they abduct return as Pod People-like drones, normal in appearance until they reveal themselves. The government's response is you - a technician driving custom-built gun cameras mounted around the town. Similar to Night Trap or Double Switch, you must monitor the town for alien activity, and respond to protect the lives of the citizens and your agents.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,142,36950,28029,27314,64204,25300,71455,36781,11253],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870981,536871045,536871128,536871835,536871882,536871937,536876663,536876923,536876990,1073741825],"developers":[1181],"publishers":[2351],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,133,216,923,970,1025,5751,6011,6078],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":752112000000,"platforms":[78],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":78,"date":752112000000,"region":2,"human":"1993-Nov","y":1993,"m":11},{"category":2,"platform":78,"date":757296000000,"region":1,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/txvazpo659vwqghjed2g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"txvazpo659vwqghjed2g","width":255,"height":430},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ground_Zero:_Texas"}]}
