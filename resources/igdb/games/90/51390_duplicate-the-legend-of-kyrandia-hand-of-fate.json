Now, Kyrandia is disappearing. The high council found the cure for that - the anchor from the center of the world. When the young sorceress Zanthia comes to that anchor, she realizes it is not the answer. Her friend Marco is in possession of a giant hand, and it looks like that hand is responsible for the sabotage. Now, Zanthia must save Kyrandia before everything else vanishes without a trace. \n \nHand of Fate is the second installment in the Kyrandia series. The gameplay is similar to that of the previous game. Interaction is possible only with highlighted objects on the screen, and is reduced to a single cursor, without the distinction of separate commands. There are also no branching dialogues. Many of the puzzles involve picking up ingredients and concocting magic spells out of them.","popularity":1,"games":[14605,43130,44591,17469,23175,28277,27266,63734,72412,63718],"tags":[268435487,536872006],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}]}
