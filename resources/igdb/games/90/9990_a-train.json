Another goal is to provide the impetus for your chosen city to develop. There are a number of different places to set up business each with different layouts and existing houses and businesses.\n\nThe main money earners are passenger trains, that can be scheduled to pick up passengers at the times of day when the demand is high. However, in the long term you need the city to develop. This requires setting up trains that transport resources to where they are needed. These resources are used to build houses, and other buildings, increasing the number of passengers for your commuter trains.\n\nAs the city develops, new businesses will spring up, such as stadiums, high rise office blocks, and ski resorts. You can also build your own businesses, the success of which will depend on the local population, the presence of competing businesses, and even the changes of the seasons, among other factors.","collection":1335,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,16125,73075,11362,2015,32283],"tags":[28,268435471,536871827,1073741827],"publishers":[1271,284],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[915],"themes":[28],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[13,118,16,121,58],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":118,"region":5,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":58,"region":5,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":121,"region":5,"human":"TBD"}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Take the A-Train III","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Take the A-Train III S.V.","comment":"Super Famicom Title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qpbzgl4aglfuyej5wmp8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qpbzgl4aglfuyej5wmp8","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vcxxet4fxc4llihjpk50.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vcxxet4fxc4llihjpk50","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pm3x4mvc8czr5eoepbuy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pm3x4mvc8czr5eoepbuy","width":800,"height":947}}
