Once the snake is long enough the exit will appear and the player will be able to progress to the next level. Each level has a different smattering of obstacles that the player must avoid, which also includes any other part of the snake itself. \n \nThough originally released on the MSX 2 home computer by Sony, it was later ported by Taito to the PC-88 and Famicom Disk System. The FDS version saw the biggest differences from the original, as every ten stages includes a boss that the player's snake must chase around and shoot down before they are able to proceed. It also reduces the number of levels from 300 (in the MSX and PC-88 versions) to 100.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,16468,23175,40524,59516,28029,68324,55289,56353],"tags":[1,536871078,536872668,536875666],"category":0,"keywords":[166,1756,4754],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":575337600000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":575337600000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Mar-26","y":1988,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/trob4dt5cjcgvytk220i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"trob4dt5cjcgvytk220i","width":650,"height":965}}
