It is themed around the Indianapolis 500, and is based on Atari's earlier 8-player arcade game, Indy 800. \n \nIndy 500 was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. Sears Tele-Games later re-released it as Race; no changes were made to the gameplay. Included with each game was a set of two driving controllers, which were identical in appearance to the 2600 paddle controller but could rotate indefinitely in either direction, among other differences.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[27378,76566,57187,55192,40470,76253,103316,44178,27553,17131],"tags":[1,268435466,268435486,536871846,536875069,536875128,536875258,536875411,536875412,536875416,536875435,536875955,536876069,536877676,536879140,1073741827],"developers":[15600],"publishers":[15600],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[934,4157,4216,4346,4499,4500,4504,4523,5043,5157,6764,8228],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,30],"first_release_date":252374400000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":283910400000,"region":1,"human":"1978","y":1978,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":252374400000,"region":2,"human":"1977","y":1977,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Race"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5s1g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5s1g","width":376,"height":225}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"yJlOERmMJGw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yxmerloaicmanyal2dvr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yxmerloaicmanyal2dvr","width":268,"height":371},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indy_500_(1977_video_game)"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":59,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2}]}
