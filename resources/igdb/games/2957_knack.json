A human doctor, who studied ancient relics from a long lost civilization for many years, finally found a way to bind them together and give them consciousness. The result was Knack, a creature with mysterious powers. For example, he can incorporate more relics into his body as he finds them, which allows him to transform from a three-foot tall creature into a gigantic wrecking machine. The doctor believes that Knack will be an invaluable asset in the war against the Goblins, until it becomes clear that an even greater danger is posed by elements of the human community.","collection":2540,"hypes":1,"rating":59.52357463925,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":60.2727272727273,"aggregated_rating_count":13,"total_rating":59.89815095598865,"total_rating_count":38,"rating_count":25,"games":[2933,55038,36950,26194,20342,25300,19150,24426,1595,55173],"tags":[1,18,268435464,268435487,536871008,536871351,536871475,536871487,536871529,536871882,536872961,536873154,536873810,536874022,536875055,536875081,536875194,536875209,536875265,536875316,536875435,536875713,536875748,536875755,536875830,536875934,536876107,536876217,536876218,536876235,536876287,536876329,536876331,536876486,536890733,536891073,1073741826],"developers":[400],"publishers":[45],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[96,439,563,575,617,970,2049,2242,2898,3110,4143,4169,4282,4297,4353,4404,4523,4801,4836,4843,4918,5022,5195,5305,5306,5323,5375,5417,5419,5574,19821,20161],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":1384473600000,"pulse_count":10,"platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1385683200000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Nov-29","y":2013,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1384473600000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Nov-15","y":2013,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1385683200000,"human":"2013-Nov-29","y":2013,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Knack's Adventure","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lzqqfv9dki9zd3p59df2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lzqqfv9dki9zd3p59df2","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dodospi1ugx7yqjvuwko.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dodospi1ugx7yqjvuwko","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p7vggjj6y9skhwlwpxl9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p7vggjj6y9skhwlwpxl9","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cl6otmjh8ewnxzjipgkp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cl6otmjh8ewnxzjipgkp","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ei1bno44rz2z3rmokame.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ei1bno44rz2z3rmokame","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"1skIkmPD5d0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/phwkkmym5pqd7xvfqyme.jpg","cloudinary_id":"phwkkmym5pqd7xvfqyme","width":256,"height":320},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action-adventure game in which players help a small hero, composed of ancient relics, protect mankind from an invading goblin army. Players use punches, jumping attacks, and various super moves (e.g., storm attack, shockwave, blast) to defeat human soldiers and fantasy creatures (e.g., giant bugs, goblins, robots). As player progress through the game, Knack can grow in size to battle larger enemies including tanks, mechanized battle suits, and attack planes. The somewhat frenetic combat is accompanied by impact sounds and mild explosions.","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knack_(video_game)"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/us.playstation.com\/ps4\/games\/knack-ps4.html"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":48,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
