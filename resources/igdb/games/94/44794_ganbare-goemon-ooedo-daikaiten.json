Unlike previous Goemon games, which have used sprites or 3-D models for the characters, the characters are now represented by pre-rendered CGI, giving them a quasi-3-D look. Also, Yae is featured in her outfit that first appeared in Mononoke Suguroku.","collection":2448,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[103312,76747,37419,78632,33269,28309,35994,25812,106987,81249],"tags":[1,268435487,536871939,536873370],"category":0,"keywords":[1027,2458],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1430265600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":1430265600000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Apr-29","y":2015,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mxzsigidkltpiazqw0bx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mxzsigidkltpiazqw0bx","width":650,"height":650}}
