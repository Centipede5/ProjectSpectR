Get blown up or drive too slowly and the boss gets away. But if you make it to the check point in time, you block the boss' escape and trap him on the planet. \n \nYou can upgrade your vehicle with the cash from your bounties. You can also go up against a buddy in the vertical split-screen deathmatch mode. \n \nOff-World Interceptor's most unique feature is the storyline, told in full-motion video. Standard for the time. But OWIE's FMV is mocked by a couple of guys sitting in chairs, a la Mystery Science Theater 3000.","collection":2250,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":781056000000,"platforms":[50],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":50,"date":781056000000,"human":"1994-Oct-02","y":1994,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ewj8dbzxxskdq8dvsv85.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ewj8dbzxxskdq8dvsv85","width":1641,"height":3090}}
