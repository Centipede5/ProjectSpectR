It was released in Japan on August 5, 2004, in Europe on September 30, 2005, and in Australia in 2005. This game was never released in North America. Directed by Akira Ueda and planned by Goichi Suda, the game focuses on a news crew for the fictional ZaKa TV, dedicated to covering strange phenomena. The game is unique in the sense that it is played almost entirely though the viewfinder of a camera; and the game is lost if the player runs out of film before solving the mysteries in a mission.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[103298,19686,103281,37605,6188,520,40017,101440,103301,32902],"tags":[19,268435461,1073741825],"developers":[845],"publishers":[1770,1053],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[19],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1091664000000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1127952000000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Sep-29","y":2005,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1091664000000,"region":5,"human":"2004-Aug-05","y":2004,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sefarepo3h4lcl0ck2kb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sefarepo3h4lcl0ck2kb","width":300,"height":424}}
