When you die by hitting yourself or the wall you can start building words with the collected letters. There are 40 levels today and to pass a level you need to write a specific set of words. For example, on level 4 you need to write atleast two words with atleast 3 letters each and one of which must start with an 'A'. \n \nGamelink: \nhttps:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=se.susapp.colorize","popularity":2,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[16814],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[101,1755,2366,19360,23312],"themes":[34],"genres":[32,33],"first_release_date":1535673600000,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":39,"region":8,"human":"TBD"},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1535673600000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Aug-31","y":2018,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jb7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jb7","width":720,"height":1280},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jb6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jb6","width":720,"height":1280}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"szOLib4DXgU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hah.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hah","width":720,"height":1280},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/alfasnake"},{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=se.susapp.colorize"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC59Y-s4VsLAEdxknp0OGQeQ"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/alfasnake1"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/AlfaSnake"}]}
