It maintained the same intuitive power-up system of \"Nemesis\", \"Salamander\" et. al. but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather that the traditional Gradius ship. Parodius' eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat\/half-boat creature.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":644025600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":644025600000,"region":8,"human":"1990-May-30","y":1990,"m":5}]}
