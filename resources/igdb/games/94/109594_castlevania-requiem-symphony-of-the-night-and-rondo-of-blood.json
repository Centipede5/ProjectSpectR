From a side-scrolling perspective, players traverse Dracula's castle to kill fantastical enemies (e.g., zombies, demons, minotaurs). Characters use whips, swords, axes, and magic to defeat enemies. Pixelated blood is depicted when players' character and creatures are killed; some attacks result in decapitation and dismemberment of creatures, including a boss character that loses its body parts and entrails. As players progress, they may encounter female creatures (e.g., harpies, medusa) that have exposed buttocks and are depicted topless, though there are no discernible details (i.e., no nipples).","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.konami.com\/games\/castlevania\/us\/en-us\/page\/history_2018_x_son_rob"}]}
