Thus players capture invisible creatures called \"invizimals\" to use them in battles against other invizimals in tournament-style matches.  Capturing  invizimals means shooting them with fireballs, luring them into the PSP camera, surrounding them with flames;  Fighting  means that the little fantasy creatures use elemental (fire, wind, ice, etc.) and physical attacks to defeat their animated opponents. Invizimals can \"claw-slash,\" spit fire, shoot spikes, or use toxic flatulence to inflict damage. One creature (Flameclaw) stabs itself with its stinger if it loses a match; another creature (Skysaur) shoots projectiles from its rear end; and the Bongorilla invizimal picks its nose and wipes its boogers on the ground. The game contains live-action cutscenes in which real actors sometimes push and shove each other; the scenes are often dramatic and may include frequent references to kidnapping, or discussions about \"weaponizing\" the invizimals.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/invizimals.eu.playstation.com\/\u200e"}]}
