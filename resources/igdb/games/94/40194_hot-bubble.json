This seems to have been a revision of Puzzle World, which itself is a sequel to Dolmen, with the same character sprites from Prehistorik 2 or Puzzle Land. So far there's no trace of the 1996 Pandora itself, but there a later adult version called Hot Bubble, which still contains many instances of the Pandora logo.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}]}
