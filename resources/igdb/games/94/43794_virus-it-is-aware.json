{"id":43794,"name":"Virus: It is Aware","slug":"virus-it-is-aware","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/virus-it-is-aware","created_at":1499162636530,"updated_at":1536960888406,"summary":"Loosely based on the film (and in turn, the comic book), the game is about an alien electrical life-form (usually referred to as \"the Evil\") which hijacks a space station, beams itself down to a ship called The Electra and plans to take over the world. To do so, it killed the ship crew and outfitted them with implants to infiltrate the human race. Unlike in the film, the ship makes it to port and the cyborg monsters infest the \"Nakomi hotel\". A female police officer and specialist in criminology, Joan Averil, is sent in to investigate \"strange events\" along with her partner Sutter. They discover the monsters, and fight their way through, rescuing two civilians on the way. Yakuza criminals also appear as enemies on the way. As reports of strange activity on The Electra surfaces, they track the infestation down to the ship and board it. Joan reveals that her brother Thomas works on the ship, and hopes to find him. They do, but Sutter is killed. They eventually manage to blow up the ship and escape. The ending cinematic ominously zooms out to depict the infested space station.","popularity":1,"games":[25646,55038,68287,28029,29525,33726,76566,27011,27266,36950],"tags":[1,18,19,268435465,536871882,536875069,1073741826],"publishers":[234],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[970],"themes":[1,18,19],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":946598400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":7,"date":946598400000,"region":8,"human":"1999","y":1999,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a8cf5hdtup7wx3abrank.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a8cf5hdtup7wx3abrank","width":252,"height":252},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Virus:_It_is_Aware"}]}
