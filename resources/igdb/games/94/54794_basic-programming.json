It was released in 1979, and it was one of only a few non-gaming cartridges ever designed for the 2600. The programming language was superficially similar to dialects of BASIC, but differed in many important aspects. The extremely small RAM size of the Atari 2600, 128 bytes, severely restricted the possibilities of this cartridge for writing programs.","popularity":2,"games":[44242,28465,34919,33603,36962,55888,65827,75102,43130,28277],"tags":[34,268435469,1073741829],"developers":[82],"publishers":[82],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"themes":[34],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":315446400000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":315446400000,"human":"1979","y":1979,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zbho0zj5tmfcerdtjdyq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zbho0zj5tmfcerdtjdyq","width":600,"height":841}}
