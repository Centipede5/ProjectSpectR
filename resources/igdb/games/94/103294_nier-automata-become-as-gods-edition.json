Players use swords, spears, lances, and lasers to destroy enemy robots in melee-style combat. Large explosions and realistic gunfire are frequently heard during combat. Some sequences depict blood and additional acts of violence against human-like characters: a man impaled through the chest with a sword, resulting in large blood-splatter effects; character lying in pools of blood after getting stabbed. Some characters wear revealing outfits with partially exposed buttocks; one male character is depicted nude (without genitalia). The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d are heard in the dialogue. ","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.niergame.com\/en-us\/home\/"}]}
