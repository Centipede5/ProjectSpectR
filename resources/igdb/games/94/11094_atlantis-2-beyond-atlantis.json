He is bound on an adventure to Tibet, where he will gradually discover his destiny from a wizened old shaman. From quest to celestial journey, his path will be strewn with traps and enigmas that he must solve to re-establish the order and balance of the Universe set-up hundreds of years ago. If he fails then the dark half of the force will be triumphant and will bring back the times of chaos once again. Atlantis II plunges you into an adventure unlike any other. Discover beautiful settings, mysterious puzzles, unusual characters, and strange creatures.","storyline":"In this adventure game, take Ten, the Bearer of Light, through his journey to Shambhala to confront the Bearer of Dark so that balance can be returned to the Universe. To find Shambhala, he must gather the pieces that make up the \"road to Shambhala\" from different locations and time periods \u2013 China, Ireland and the Yucat\u00e1n. \n\nYou begin aboard a ship in the mountains of Tibet, which acts as a home base. As the pieces are found and put in place, Ten is mystically transported to exotic locations and will become different characters. Each \"chapter\" can be played in any order since each is self-contained with its own puzzles, objects and people. Although each chapter is autonomous the final reward of each one is another piece of \"the road to Shamballa\". \n\nYucat\u00e1n The character in the Yucat\u00e1n chapter is Tepec, a loyal follower of a local city's king. Tepec's kingdom is in trouble because its protector-god, Quetzalcoatl (the Feathered Serpent), has fallen asleep and as a result great misfortunes happen to the kingdom; the corn crop is dying and a rival king makes a campaign to conquer Tepec's kingdom. So Tepec is assigned with the mission to go to the land of the dead, Xibalba, and awaken Quetzalcoatl to receive chulel, the divine blood which has life giving powers.\n\nIreland Ten is transformed into Felim, a monk living in an Irish monastery in the early centuries of Christianity. He discovers a living remain of an ancient Irish king and then begins interacting with a set of characters from an old myth which is written in a book in the monastery library. His final goal is to help the characters get to the end of the story.\n\nChina In this chapter Ten is in the body of a travelling Chinese civil servant who is stuck in a monastery because a ghost-shadow is blocking the entrance. As water supplies are running short, he decides to use the help of the Master of Directions to travel to a Chinese version of the land of the dead to consult an immortal excorcism master.\n\nShamballa Shamballa is a fantasy place, which acts as a final screen of protection between the home base and the Dark's prison. Queen Rhea, a character from the prequel of the series is waiting there to link the story between the two games and guide Ten to the final level of the game, which is no other than the sunk Atlantis.","collection":1491,"rating":40,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":1,"games":[236,25222,8762,28070,65503,15537,18011,27266,27725,81249],"tags":[17,268435458,268435465,268435487,536871115,536872286,536872328,1073741825],"developers":[234],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[203,1374,1416],"themes":[17],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":946598400000,"platforms":[6,39,14],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":946598400000,"human":"1999","y":1999,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":946598400000,"human":"1999","y":1999,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":39,"date":1356912000000,"human":"2012","y":2012,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Atlantis 2"},{"name":"Atlantis II"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ubopt5trikd03z4ky6ub.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ubopt5trikd03z4ky6ub","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uqcyagyybu7f39krhsvl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uqcyagyybu7f39krhsvl","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i1yihuem3wbkr9nzh8vt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i1yihuem3wbkr9nzh8vt","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qch0jtpthqkb0ijlhkzd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qch0jtpthqkb0ijlhkzd","width":800,"height":500},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/teghibpgtibwdavwl9az.jpg","cloudinary_id":"teghibpgtibwdavwl9az","width":480,"height":360}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"fqYci8wLJic"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z75ssrkghopwzrexlrjr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z75ssrkghopwzrexlrjr","width":379,"height":500},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atlantis_II"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/362920"}],"external":{"steam":"362920"}}
