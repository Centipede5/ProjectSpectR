It features the Army's experimental RAH-66 Comanche light attack helicopter (LHX). \n \nThe game features a simple flight model and allows the player's helicopter to take much more damage than it could in reality. Additionally, weapons on the Comanche feature deadly accuracy and power. \n \nThere are over 20 scripted campaign missions, similar to all other NovaLogic simulations.","collection":1102,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[106008,101573,82117,102805,78550,27744,79134,34919,21642,9760],"tags":[39,268435469,536870933,1073741825],"developers":[92],"publishers":[92],"game_engines":[125],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[21],"themes":[39],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[6,13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Comanche: Operation White Lightning"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5qun.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5qun","width":320,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5qum.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5qum","width":320,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5qul.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5qul","width":320,"height":240}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"Uc3zGZnI6ak"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vnqfuogbnhz8f0pdh0f2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vnqfuogbnhz8f0pdh0f2","width":2150,"height":2709}}
