The first release of RailWorks contained all of the five real-world routes of the original European and North American releases of Rail Simulator, and added three new fictional routes: a large UK goods yard, a route set in the Alpine region and a route based around Denver, Colorado.[3] \n \nIt is a Steamworks title, which means it uses and requires Steam to activate and to deliver core game updates. Steam is also used to deliver additional routes and locomotives in the form of DLC.
