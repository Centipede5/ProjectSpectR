Originally designed for the Commodore 64 and released in 1986, it provides a graphical user interface for this popular 8-bit computer. GEOS closely resembles early versions of the classic Mac OS and includes a graphical word processor (geoWrite) and paint program (geoPaint). \n \nA December 1987 survey by the Commodore-dedicated magazine Compute!'s Gazette found that nearly half of its readers used GEOS. For many years, Commodore bundled GEOS with its redesigned and cost-reduced C64, the C64C. At its peak, GEOS was the third-most-popular microcomputer operating system in the world in terms of units shipped, trailing only MS-DOS and Mac OS (besides the original Commodore 64's KERNAL).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[80212,79797,65926,14169,80834,80714,80301,79246,79126,78320],"tags":[268435486,536871846,536875412,536875416,536879173],"category":0,"keywords":[934,4500,4504,8261],"genres":[30],"first_release_date":507600000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":507600000000,"region":8,"human":"1986-Feb-01","y":1986,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j7tv6wn9fcxcrlmqezev.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j7tv6wn9fcxcrlmqezev","width":884,"height":1150}}
