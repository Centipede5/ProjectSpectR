Players will relive the events of \u2018Operation Market Garden\u2019 across the fields and towns of Holland. \n \n\u2018The Bloody Seventh\u2019 is our name for the initial focus of the project as we feel it succinctly details the struggle that the British paratroopers had to endure while waiting for their army counterpart to establish a link through the Lower Rhine. \n \nIn a 50 vs. 50 multiplayer setting, players will be given the option to fight with the British Airborne Division and its Polish brigade, British XXX Corps or several branches of the German Army, such as the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. It\u2019s a rare opportunity to experience the intense battlefield that was the Battle of Arnhem, which stretched across farms, woods, villages and city areas. Each area is being accurately recreated from archival references that range from street level to aerial images. Whether you\u2019re jumping out of a plane, resupplying friendlies or operating a tank you will find multiple reasons to drop back into the battlefield in this grand scaled representation of a WW2 setting never explored in a large multiplayer environment. \n \nFEATURES \n \nInspired by game such as \u201cRed Orchestra ostfront 41-45\u201d , \u201cBattleground Europe: WWII Online\u201d or \u201cArmA\u201d we want to provide the perfect mix of realism on large scale maps. \n \nTeamwork oriented gameplay that doesn\u2019t require a clan or private server to realize the potential of the gameplay entirely. \n \nBuilt in Voice Over IP using the best codecs available, with attenuated localized, intra-squad radio, and inter-squad command radio communications. \n \n3 exclusives games modes, with \u201cBase building\u201d and \u201cBase development\u201d game mechanics usually found in Real Time Strategy games. \n \nA Logistics system based around drivable vehicles, designed to support bases in the field, all player maintained. \n \nLarge scale maps from 4km\u00b2 up to 8km\u00b2. \n \nHigh-quality and accurate models remodeled from historical references and archives. \n \nA very open development team with excellent community communication, and preparations in progress for mod support near retail release. \n \nInfantry, Logistics, Fortifications and Mechanised Warfare.","rating":50,"popularity":29.66666666666667,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":0,"games":[78550,18623,19549,25311,36553,79134,37419,23345,55029,32283],"tags":[1,22,39,268435461,268435469,268435471,268435488,536870931,536871365,1073741825],"developers":[14737],"publishers":[5087],"game_engines":[583],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[2,5],"keywords":[19,453],"themes":[1,22,39],"genres":[5,13,15,32],"first_release_date":1533772800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1533772800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Aug-09","y":2018,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Post Scriptum - The Bloody Seventh"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xzcdiry7lq1cyuvlhc5o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xzcdiry7lq1cyuvlhc5o","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/imhsmxfc8hjsgoon7mf7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"imhsmxfc8hjsgoon7mf7","width":1920,"height":870},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o5wqvij1savswdlrymep.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o5wqvij1savswdlrymep","width":1920,"height":870},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oyz9huha9oiqdovtayer.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oyz9huha9oiqdovtayer","width":1920,"height":870},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hnuclf1isysintgprh7c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hnuclf1isysintgprh7c","width":1920,"height":870}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"zAb-LLdPNio"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"W24njMwPkCM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ryyizpgb88johwu5vnng.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ryyizpgb88johwu5vnng","width":756,"height":1080},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"https:\/\/squad.gamepedia.com\/Post_Scriptum"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC4Xl-vuThkFEGHlJO3CuEsg"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PostScriptumGam"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PostScriptumGame"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/postscriptumgame.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/736220"}],"external":{"steam":"736220"}}
