It was announced at the Metal Gear 20th Anniversary Party. It is available for download in Japan and North America. For now, the North American version of the game is exclusive to the Verizon network. On February 14, 2008, Metal Gear Solid Mobile won the \"Grand Prix\" and \"Operator's Choice\" awards at the 2008 International Mobile Gaming Awards. \n \nThe player controls Solid Snake using the keypad on the phone. Gameplay is a combination of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3. For example, the player can take pictures using the phone's digital camera and transfer them onto Snake's sneaking suit, creating an all new camouflage to wear. The camera also controls the in-game camera, and will also be able to aim Nikita missiles. Hanging off ledges and hiding in lockers will also be possible. VR missions are also included.","collection":2128,"franchise":463,"franchises":[463],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55038,36950,103054,25300,25311,62151,68287,11171,105269,10964],"tags":[1,18,23,268435487,536870913,536871044,536871882,536872131,536874743,536875171,536875358,536875831,536876363,536877558,536880234,536880707,1073741827],"developers":[129,170],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,132,970,1219,3831,4259,4446,4919,5451,6646,9322,9795],"themes":[1,18,23],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1228953600000,"platforms":[42,55],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":42,"date":1228953600000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Dec-11","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":55,"date":1230681600000,"region":2,"human":"2008","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":55,"date":1230681600000,"region":5,"human":"2008","y":2008,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mu5xyndmhug4vwxtsak6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mu5xyndmhug4vwxtsak6","width":225,"height":300},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Solid_Mobile"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/metalgear.wikia.com\/wiki\/Metal_Gear_Solid_Mobile"}]}
