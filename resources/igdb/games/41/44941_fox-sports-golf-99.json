Players can also practice their pitching and putting techniques or work on their long game by having a whack at the driving range. A traditional triple click interface is used to execute each shot, and two commentators will call the action as you progress through the links: choose legendary announcer Peter Allis, Fox Sports Net's John Walls, or have both analyzing your game.","collection":1641,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[35626,22690,61239,41429,20807,18008,72175,44736,47338,41548],"tags":[268435470,536870942,536871223,536872078,536873274,536875176,536875177,536875626,536875627,536875824,536876252,536880761,536884032],"category":0,"keywords":[30,311,1166,2362,4264,4265,4714,4715,4912,5340,9849,13120],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":901756800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":901756800000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jul-30","y":1998,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Actua Golf 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h5ibiipu0yizqndaj024.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h5ibiipu0yizqndaj024","width":250,"height":250},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
