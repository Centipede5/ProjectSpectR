Players manage a historical empire, including thousands of troops and sea vessels that can attack enemy countries. While much of the battle preparation and fighting takes place on land and sea maps, players can also direct their units into turn-based combat involving cannons, guns, and other explosives. Some of the more intense depictions of violence are contained within cutscene sequences: an army of British soldiers ambushed by French soldiers; the aftermath of soldiers massacred on the battlefield with small pools of blood surrounding their bodies; a man being executed at the chopping block as the camera fades to red. The game also allows players to build up their country's economy, which can include the construction and management of tobacco plantations and wineries. Profanity (e.g., \"sh*t\") can occasionally be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - \r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.totalwar.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/10500"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Empire:_Total_War"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/wiki.totalwar.com\/w\/Empire_Total_War"}],"external":{"steam":"10500"}}
