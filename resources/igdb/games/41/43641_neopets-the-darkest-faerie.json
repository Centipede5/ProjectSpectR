By switching between the two at any time, players can use Tor's up-close melee attacks or cause damage from afar with Roberta's spells. This game stays faithful to the traditional third-person action-adventure. Magical items and weapons gained along the way will develop the characters' abilities and strengths. In particular, elementally-aligned motes can be attached to weapons and armor as a combat bonus. There are many puzzles and side-quests along the way, and players will fight evil Neopets.","collection":4302,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68324,25646,47823,12632,36608,26223,34919,36926,27209,64204],"tags":[1,268435465,536871208,536875257],"category":0,"keywords":[296,4345],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1132876800000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1132876800000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Nov-25","y":2005,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z3eukydoaykpuuze4f8o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z3eukydoaykpuuze4f8o","width":1524,"height":2156},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
