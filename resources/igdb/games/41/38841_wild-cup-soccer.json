In one player mode you can play a Wild Cup or a League system; two player games are restricted to single \u2018Unfriendly\u2019 matches. \n \nUnlike its predecessor the game uses an isometric viewpoint, perhaps because the original FIFA was so popular at the time. A number of vicious moves are on offer, with tackles Vinnie Jones would flinch at along with lethal head-butts and shoulder barges. If a game finishes drawn, it goes into a \u2018Penalty Shoot Out\u2019, which involves going round shooting the opposition;\u2013 the last team standing wins. The pre-match screens include attacking at defensive play styles, transfers and the chance to buy items such as rocket launchers and shields.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,15851,36608,34919,55715,14713,80292,78813,78041,78015],"tags":[1,268435470,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[1166],"themes":[1],"genres":[14]}
