Due to cartridge storage limitations, the Nintendo 64 version is based on the original PC floppy version and lacks the FMV scenes and Redbook audio music introduced in the CD-ROM version, although it has new narrative introductions to the levels.","popularity":1,"version_parent":3512,"version_title":"Nintendo 64 port","category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kkoo5mdr8yz00glyrjye.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kkoo5mdr8yz00glyrjye","width":2099,"height":1529}}
