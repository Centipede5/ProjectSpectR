Pick the rods and lures that fit your fishing style and get ready to reel. While out on the lake, make new friends who will offer advice or a challenge; completing challenges opens new areas to fish. Every area requires finesse, not brawn, to bring in the catch. Never miss a second of the fight with a unique underwater perspective that shows how hard the fish are working. Everything for a great day out on the lake is in BASS RISE, and the best part is, you won't have to clean the fish after you catch them.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44242,27744,30830,35099,18623,29173,32457,68049,55689,55590],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536871421,536872060,536872928,536875054,536875232,536875233,536875258,536875437,536876274,536876437,536882693,1073741825],"developers":[617],"publishers":[617],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[509,1148,2016,4142,4320,4321,4346,4525,5362,5525,11781],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":796089600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":796089600000,"human":"1995-Mar-25","y":1995,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cpdxocn0uawthtfbmiiz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cpdxocn0uawthtfbmiiz","width":2402,"height":2856},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
