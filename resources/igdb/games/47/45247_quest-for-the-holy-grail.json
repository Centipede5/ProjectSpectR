You must navigate your way around the villages and countryside of medieval England to track down the clues that will help you on your quest. You will need to find objects to help you negotiate your way past the characters dotted along the way, such as the White Rabbit and the Knight Who Says Nic. The Quest for the Holy Grail is a trip through a possible version of history, with a liberal sprinkling of humour thrown in too.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":444441600000,"platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":444441600000,"region":8,"human":"1984-Feb-01","y":1984,"m":2}]}
