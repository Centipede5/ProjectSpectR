It is set in the Sengoku era of Japanese history. \n \nZan II: Spirits is the first Super Famicom game in Wolf Team's series of strategy sims set in historical Japan. It was eventually followed up with a sequel, Zan III: Spirits. \n \nAs with its thematically-similar contemporaries, like Shingen the Ruler or Nobunaga's Ambition, Zan II puts the player in the geta of a Japanese feudal lord, or daimyo, with designs to wrest control over the rest of Japan from the other daimyos. The game is more focused on warfare than day-to-day resource management, with armies of samurai marching across the map to attack fortresses and pagodas that host enemy flags.","collection":3673,"popularity":1,"games":[18623,23345,29173,55590,55036,19934,9199,55689,19376,44242],"tags":[22,268435469,268435471,536871063,536872060,536874694,536879800],"category":0,"keywords":[151,1148,3782,8888],"themes":[22],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":707097600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":707097600000,"region":5,"human":"1992-May-29","y":1992,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":709776000000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jun-29","y":1992,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Zan 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h0wdoi1n5vof0t6zegxg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h0wdoi1n5vof0t6zegxg","width":563,"height":312}}
