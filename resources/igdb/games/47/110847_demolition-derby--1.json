Two target drones are always on the screen, darting around in competive evasive action as though they are controlled independantly. When a player has his or her car hit a drone, the drone is demolished and a point is scored. Drone wreckage remains on the screen and another comes into action. As drones pile up, each player must maneuver with increased speed and skill to increase his or her score before time is up. \n \n(Destruction Derby was the Exidy prototype from 1975, it was licensed to and released Chicago Coin as Demolition Derby in 1976)","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[100934,91085,90965,99307,90788,87728,87150,87170,11510,87514],"tags":[268435489],"publishers":[16722],"category":0,"genres":[33],"first_release_date":189302400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":189302400000,"human":"1976-Jan-01","y":1976,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1h2k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1h2k","width":850,"height":1105}}
