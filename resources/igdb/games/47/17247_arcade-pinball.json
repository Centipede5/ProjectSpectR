It is an exclusive version of Video Pinball produced by Sears and was programmed by Bob Smith. Arcade Pinball featured actual simulations of a pinball machine ball shooter, flippers, bumpers and spinners. The game also implemented a simulation of a real ball's actual physics. The game also features a unique rollover bonus with an Atari Inc. logo on the playfield; hitting the logo four times results in an extra ball. Most of the game play involves learning how to perform specific functions, such as launching the ball or activating the flippers, with the Atari 2600 joystick. Moving the joystick controller down pulls the pinball machine plunger back while pressing the joystick button shoots the ball into the playfield. The left and right flippers are activated by moving the joystick controller left or right. The ball can be nudged (as in nudging a table gently in real life) by holding down the joystick button and moving the controller in a particular direction.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[101949,101946,101939,101661,101660,101575,101559,101513,101381,101373],"tags":[268435489,1073741827],"developers":[2519],"publishers":[2519],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":378604800000,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Video Pinball"}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"WBjtsJ_DJio"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/haopxfcamq3r23jio7me.jpg","cloudinary_id":"haopxfcamq3r23jio7me","width":600,"height":818}}
