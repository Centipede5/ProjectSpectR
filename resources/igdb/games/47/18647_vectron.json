You add each section by moving your energy block in place and filling it with an energy blast. You must protect your energy block against Hungrees, G-spheres, splits, sweeps, and prizums who can destroy it. Shoot them down with energy blasts or neutralize them with special energy from an E-Pak. Don't run out of energy or you lose an energy block. There are three energy blocks per game. When they're gone, the game is over.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,10039,32902,68287,68142,28751,51485,36794],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,536872810,1073741826],"developers":[2521],"publishers":[2521],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1898],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":67,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/enymu0s0ghw4tr9u7isk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"enymu0s0ghw4tr9u7isk","width":1440,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lj5aystdm4vuv5sl7xqk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lj5aystdm4vuv5sl7xqk","width":1000,"height":1415}}
