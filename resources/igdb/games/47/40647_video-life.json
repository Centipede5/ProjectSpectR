It is a version of the zero-player cellular automaton known as Conway's Game of Life. Video Life was only available through a special mail order offer to owners of CommaVid's Magicard, which itself is considered to be one of the rarest Atari 2600 cartridges ever released. According to original CommaVid co-owner Irwin Gaines, only 20 cartridges or less of Video Life were ever made. Editors of AtariAge estimate approximately 500 cartridges were produced. A report in the Chicago Reader by Jeffrey Felshman estimates that cartridges would sell for as much $3000 at the time.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[48799,46937,40905,40903,40897,40887,19222,27266,41348,73189],"tags":[34,268435465,536871446],"category":0,"keywords":[534],"themes":[34],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":360201600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":360201600000,"region":8,"human":"1981-Jun-01","y":1981,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m9qplkwew2ickyh1vwe2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m9qplkwew2ickyh1vwe2","width":600,"height":817}}
