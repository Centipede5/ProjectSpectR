Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and visit locales in a changed world unlike anything seen in Call of Duty\u00ae before.MultiplayerIn Call of Duty: Ghosts you don't just create a class, you create a soldier, a first for the franchise. In the new Create-A-Soldier system, players can change the physical appearance of their soldier by choosing the head, body type, head-gear and equipment, and for the first time in a Call of Duty\u00ae game, the player can also choose their gender.
