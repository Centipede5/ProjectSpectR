There are no given strategies, rails to move on, or paths to follow; it\u2018s up to the player to decide how he will play through both the story-driven missions and generated missions with randomized objectives. Whether using stealth or a more direct approach, players will need to use their strategic thinking and use both basic and advanced weaponry while facing many different opponents - ranging from unorganized local militia to smart and skilled mercenaries. \n \nWith highly replayable missions, achievements, weapons to unlock and whole campaigns to be regularly added, Arma Tactics offers many hours of intense ever-changing action.","popularity":1,"games":[11362,9760,33603,36962,55888,73075,65827,2015,32283,75065],"tags":[268435461,268435471],"category":0,"genres":[5,15],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tfsewu0tv3nzwtjk33kg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tfsewu0tv3nzwtjk33kg","width":1600,"height":900}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y5w2xc9qxesujjaj8k88.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y5w2xc9qxesujjaj8k88","width":1280,"height":1280}}
