Your fighter plane is aged and under-powered, yet you must face down large planes, tanks and ground targets to achieve victory. Each level ends with a close-viewed section of particular intensity before finally facing a boss. Smart bombs are occasionally found lying around, and can destroy everything on the screen, although you can't use them on the bosses. A simultaneous 2-player mode is provided.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28751,28029,68287,36950,10209,64204,27314,10039,25311,76246],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536870913,536871078,536875171,1073741827],"developers":[11739],"publishers":[10080,11739],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1,166,4259],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[52,63,16,15,26,25,64,27],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":64,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/baucewh8aqcdhgdqrjib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"baucewh8aqcdhgdqrjib","width":640,"height":769}}
