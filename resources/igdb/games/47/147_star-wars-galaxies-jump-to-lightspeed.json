It also added real-time space shooter elements to the game, which allowed for an interesting combination with the turn-based mode already featured in the ground-based. Jump to Lightspeed also added many space missions and four space-specific professions. Two races were also added: Sullustan and Ithorian. \n \nThe expansion added space combat. Characters could choose one of three factions in the new Pilot sub-profession: Rebel, Imperial, or Freelance. The playable sectors include the space surrounding the ten planets of the game as well as Kessel and \"Deep Space.\" Combat is real-time and twitch-oriented like a first-person shooter and can be played with a joystick at the player's option. A new Artisan profession, Shipwright, was also introduced. This profession created ships, shields, armor, weapons, etc for players. They also have the ability to take looted components from space and reverse engineer them into better components.","collection":56,"franchise":1,"franchises":[1],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":74.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":74.5,"total_rating_count":2,"game":145,"games":[26401,145,19301,2971,26766,25300,166,12858,168,139],"tags":[18,268435468,268435469,536870915,536870936,536871148,536871283,536871422,536871882,536871938,536872060,536872129,536872245,536872449,536874140,536875054,536875262,536875271,536875358,536875525,536875735,536875803,536875835,536875836,536875847,536876028,536876232,536876269,536877197,536877198,536877220,536877501,536878306,536878322,536879752,536880363,536880376,536880753,536881074,536881075,536881122,536881415,536883035,536884022,536884848,536885973,1073741826],"developers":[243],"publishers":[10],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[3,24,236,371,510,970,1026,1148,1217,1333,1537,3228,4142,4350,4359,4446,4613,4823,4891,4923,4924,4935,5116,5320,5357,6285,6286,6308,6589,7394,7410,8840,9451,9464,9841,10162,10163,10210,10503,12123,13110,13936,15061],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,13],"first_release_date":1098835200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1098835200000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Oct-27","y":2004,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"JTL","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g1nxllwf7ytacfcqimar.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g1nxllwf7ytacfcqimar","width":1405,"height":1056},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bdeqxkzjpt62y109vy19.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bdeqxkzjpt62y109vy19","width":1405,"height":1056}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"YnJv026BsbU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ngk2wm0igpatdtxvvcft.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ngk2wm0igpatdtxvvcft","width":756,"height":1080},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Wars_Galaxies:_Jump_to_Lightspeed"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/starwars.wikia.com\/wiki\/Star_Wars_Galaxies:_Jump_to_Lightspeed"}]}
