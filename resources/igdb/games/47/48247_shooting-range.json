You can choose between different difficulty levels. They affect the time you have to complete the stages. For difficulty level 1 you get 300 game time, difficulty level 2 gives you 250 and the 3rd difficulty level only 200. Items you can shoot during the game include an hourglass which extends time by 50, an E which gives you 100 points + 1 Energy bar, an E in a white square which gives you 100 points + 2 Energy bars, a Reverse E which gives you 1 Energy bar and C or W symbol which both give only 100 points each. Each disc you shoot above an enemy is worth between 100-500 points. The game contains three stages that involve a western, ghost house, and a space theme. There is also a bonus stage where you try to shoot as many bottles as possible. In the party game mode, you compete to have the highest score.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,10039,19341,68287,32902,68142,28751,51485,36950],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,536871642,536872696,536875558,1073741825],"developers":[321],"publishers":[1725],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[730,1784,4646],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":612662400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":612662400000,"region":2,"human":"1989-Jun-01","y":1989,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/krr4l3i1uekafmcdnl5v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"krr4l3i1uekafmcdnl5v","width":800,"height":1082}}
