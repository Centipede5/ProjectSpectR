You can smash your way through 4 twisting city stages, or attempt to avoid detection all together. Either way the Human AI will adapt as you progress - the more contact you have, the more aggressive they'll become. There are even some unique minigames to add to the excitement - Yeti Frisbee, managing the local \"Yeti Kingdom Of Eats\" restaurant, and catching poultry to offer to your prospective mate. You can even float down a lazy sewer river o' fun on a giant tube! Achieve the ultimate goal and show the world just what kind of Bigfoot you really are.","popularity":1,"games":[76098,51464,18387,72373,26848,65832,11588,34919,36868,36608],"tags":[1,27,536871262,536875258,536875552,536876200,536877998,1073741827],"developers":[2762],"publishers":[2759],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[350,4346,4640,5288,7086],"themes":[1,27],"first_release_date":1029456000000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1029456000000,"human":"2002-Aug-16","y":2002,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Urban Yeti","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/twdlclccsffwyl5yryrg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"twdlclccsffwyl5yryrg","width":256,"height":256},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
