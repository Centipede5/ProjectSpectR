Adjust your bike's gear-ratio settings, transmission, and tire composition before competing against seven computer-controlled riders in either a single race or a 13-event tournament. Individual practice and training sessions allow you to learn each track's layout and optimal racing lines prior to the event. View the action from a first-person perspective behind the bike's handlebars or from a third-person vantage point. Six difficulty levels and various other customization settings let you determine the degree of realism on each course. You can also challenge a friend to a head-to-head race via split-screen display. \n \n allgames","collection":4142,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[102122,27378,101439,103218,47086,102805,3772,76566,23304,44930],"tags":[32,268435466,268435470,536870969,536872078,536874337,536875069,536875117,536875562,536881407,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[11392],"publishers":[1567],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[57,1166,3425,4157,4205,4650,10495],"themes":[32],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":946598400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":946598400000,"region":8,"human":"1999","y":1999,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Castrol Honda Superbike Racing","comment":"Other"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"25U2W9qDr9w"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xzqeiag35lkoxinmdic8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xzqeiag35lkoxinmdic8","width":800,"height":1013},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
