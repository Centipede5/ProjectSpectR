Racing Hero is the spiritual successor both to Sega's wonderful \"Hang-On\" series, and to their most famous racing game, \"Out Run\". \n \nSome of Racing Hero's stages mirrored the racing-through-traffic gameplay of the Ferrari-based racer, for example perhaps the biggest similarity to Out Run is that at the end of each stage, the player can choose which route he or she wishes to take next. This differs somewhat from \"Out Run\"'s highly impressive forked-road method. In Racing Hero, the player is presented with a seperate stage-select screen and simply highlights the flag of whichever country they wish to tackle next.","collection":878,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36662,19539,64018,14363,26709,46843,12719,40470,28951,70485],"tags":[268435466,536870969,536871501,536871647,536871969,536872225,536872511,536872695,536872883,536874337,536874810,536874906,536875057,536875069,536875117,536875350,536875453,536875564,536875942,536876514,536876875,536877185,536877998],"category":0,"keywords":[57,589,735,1057,1313,1599,1783,1971,3425,3898,3994,4145,4157,4205,4438,4541,4652,5030,5602,5963,6273,7086],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":612662400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":612662400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Jun-01","y":1989,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zjfeyqcnyryqoaoy71iq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zjfeyqcnyryqoaoy71iq","width":1440,"height":1008}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gxbdxyjour2ybwmpyrdn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gxbdxyjour2ybwmpyrdn","width":850,"height":1205}}
