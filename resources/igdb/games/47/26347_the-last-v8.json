You drive out in your specially-equipped vehicle, the Last V8, only to discover that the outside world is more hostile than you would have expected. Your task is now (as commended by a digitised voice at the beginning of each level) simply to get back to the base in as short time as possible. \n \nThe Last V8 is an over-head driving game where you must drive through narrow roads without crashing into anything, and with a strict deadline for your arrival at the base. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that you have only a narrow stripe of screen space to see where you're driving; two thirds of the screen is dedicated to instruments (speed readout, radiation level and mission objectives). The steering method is not the usual Sprint one; instead you simply pull the joystick in whichever direction you want to go, pulling it in the opposite direction in case you need to decelerate.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27922,40470,28856,54789,54842,28029,55192,11208,36662,25311],"tags":[18,268435466,536870981,536872211,536875069,536875125,536875942,1073741827],"developers":[11743],"publishers":[11742],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,1299,4157,4213,5030],"themes":[18],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":502243200000,"platforms":[65,15,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":502243200000,"region":1,"human":"1985-Dec-01","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/txanbjtwniytvgxypyuj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"txanbjtwniytvgxypyuj","width":1000,"height":1572}}
