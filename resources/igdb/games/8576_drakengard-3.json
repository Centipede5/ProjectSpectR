Players use swords and bladed weapons to slash dozens of enemy soldiers, trolls, and other fantastical creatures in frenetic combat.

Cutscenes also depict intense instances of violence: characters stabbing\/impaling others with swords or lances. The game includes sexually suggestive dialogue and text (e.g., \u201cThat nympho freak was always making me try some new kink she'd heard about,\u201d \u201cWe all know you pretend to like S&M because you're actually terrible in the sack,\u201d and \u201cAn easygoing old man with an insatiable sexual appetite. Any orifice will do, and his member is the largest of any disciple's.\u201d). In a handful of brief, fantastical sequences, a female character is depicted nude while covered in blood and emerging from a giant flower. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/drakengardgame.com\/"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/drakengard.wikia.com\/wiki\/Drakengard_Wiki"}]}
