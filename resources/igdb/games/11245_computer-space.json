Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, who would both later found Atari, Inc., it is generally accepted that it was the world's first commercially sold coin-operated video game of any kind, predating the Magnavox Odyssey's release by six months, and Atari's Pong by one year. It was first location tested at The Dutch Goose in August 1971, then debuted at the MOA show on October 15, 1971, and then officially released in November 1971. Though not commercially sold, the coin operated minicomputer-driven Galaxy Game appeared around the same time, located solely at Stanford University.","collection":3468,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,36950,14364,78770,27011,55038,27208,142,7758,17111],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,536871470,536871644,536871859,536871882,536871937,536872211,536872352,536875050,536875666,536875904,536876354,536879153,1073741828],"developers":[5955],"publishers":[5955],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[558,732,947,970,1025,1299,1440,4138,4754,4992,5442,8241],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":57801600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":52,"date":57801600000,"region":2,"human":"1971-Nov","y":1971,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ijtjwwpfttqqustksrgx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ijtjwwpfttqqustksrgx","width":500,"height":403}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"j-KRmLy_Ig8"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"LUv3z7XGRRc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xrl3mg2e34zvql9oyqtx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xrl3mg2e34zvql9oyqtx","width":320,"height":206},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Computer_Space"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.computerspacefan.com\/"}]}
