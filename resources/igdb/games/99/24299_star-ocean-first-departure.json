Battles take place on a separate screen, but all characters (rather than waiting in one spot and taking damage) are fully mobile in three dimensions, can dodge and chase foes, and must cast their spells and deploy attacks despite enemy harassment. In the earlier games, magicians had spells, whereas fighters had special physical attacks called \"Killer Moves\"; both are learned after passing certain level requirements (or through specific items and sidequests) and cost HP or MP to use. In Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, all the characters are able to use spells and battle skills (i.e. killer moves).","popularity":2,"games":[49414,25636,51213,103337,15452,104236,35737,16587,103303,1449],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1227225600000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1227225600000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Nov-21","y":2008,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fn3o3mgk7suqonxrhgvq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fn3o3mgk7suqonxrhgvq","width":800,"height":1371}}
