Characters in the game are illustrated in the super deformed (chibi) art style. There are two complementary versions of the game: the SNK version and the Capcom version. Each version of the game has a different starting deck and different exclusive cards that can be obtained, but the gameplay remains the same, with card battles resembling a somewhat simplified version of Magic: The Gathering, in which a maximum of three fighters are allowed in each player's field at any given moment and there is no mana to be spent to place them in the field.","collection":2688,"franchise":1005,"franchises":[1005,1006],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741829],"developers":[1474],"publishers":[1474],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[246,1090],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":943142400000,"platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":120,"date":943142400000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Nov-21","y":1999,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"SVC Capcom Card Fighters' Clash","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n4exawupaimgzd9iuqv9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n4exawupaimgzd9iuqv9","width":480,"height":320}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bjrnafyhuesce1v84qyt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bjrnafyhuesce1v84qyt","width":640,"height":736}}
