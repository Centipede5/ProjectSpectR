The first expansion to the critically acclaimed Hearts of Iron III lets you take charge - or delegate - at any level, from division to nation, through a variety of scenarios. \n \nFeatures: \n \n*Players can now define their own Theatres with a simple dragbox system \n*The new Order of Battle Browser allows quick and easy reorganization of the entire Command Hierarchy \n*The Command Hierarchy is now directly represented on the map \n*A new Air Superiority map mode makes strategic air warfare easy \n*At game start, each country now gets to choose its own hidden Victory Conditions. Can your enemies guess your secret agenda? \n*HQs under AI control now have separate aggressiveness stances for Land, Air and Naval operations \n*Countries can request specific actions from their allies for unprecedented cooperation \n*Technological progress can now be shared with your allies \n*Brigades can now be upgraded to more advanced types (e.g. Infantry to Motorized, or Artillery to Self Propelled Artillery) \n*New 1940 scenario fills a gap in the game's timeline \n*Hundreds of new events added to immerse players in their own versions of World War II, comparing the unfolding alternate timeline to real history \n*Mighty warships can be designated the Pride of the Fleet, which is both an opportunity and a risk \n*The AI has been improved in all areas, at all levels. It will defend in depth, marshal big naval taskforces and launch multi-stage invasions. It will perform more historical diplomacy and pursue a strategic production strategy","collection":174,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"game":741,"games":[22399,55036,15894,36594,640,29173,1904,30229,23345,19376],"tags":[22,39,268435471,268435480,536870931,536871061,536871475,536871906,536872019,536872055,536872352,536872914,536873822,536874204,536874694,536875046,536875137,536875679,536876381,536876931,536877642,536880294,1073741827,1073741829],"developers":[7466],"publishers":[517],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[3,5],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[19,149,563,994,1107,1143,1440,2002,2910,3292,3782,4134,4225,4767,5469,6019,6730,9382],"themes":[22,39],"genres":[15,24],"first_release_date":1275868800000,"platforms":[6,92],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1275868800000,"human":"2010-Jun-07","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1275868800000,"human":"2010-Jun-07","y":2010,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Hearts of Iron 3: Semper Fi","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qrkzcmmwxb91gmmbpokt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qrkzcmmwxb91gmmbpokt","width":1153,"height":865},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cmxhwbroop1zscmvy17p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cmxhwbroop1zscmvy17p","width":1152,"height":866},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d5k0qmi6vpt57mnci0q5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d5k0qmi6vpt57mnci0q5","width":1153,"height":865},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y4phzlcrnpoirdam9hwa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y4phzlcrnpoirdam9hwa","width":1153,"height":865},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gpg2ttuiv6kbrpvzvgdh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gpg2ttuiv6kbrpvzvgdh","width":1152,"height":865}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nyjcv5xs5wx0awfghgxt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nyjcv5xs5wx0awfghgxt","width":357,"height":495},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.heartsofirongame.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/42900"}],"external":{"steam":"42900"}}
