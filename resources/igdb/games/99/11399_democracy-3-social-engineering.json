The expansion is \u2018themed\u2019 in that it concentrates on those areas of policy where governments can influence the make-up of the electorate in subtle low-key ways over the long term. For example, subsidies to bicycles will encourage people to exercise more (in the long run decreasing health costs) and will also encourage less people to own cars and be members of the motorists group. Other policies to encourage entrepreneurship amongst young people will eventually lead to more people becoming self employed, and so on\u2026\n\nA total of 26 policies and 8 dilemmas are included in the expansion, including food labelling, car-pooling, Labor Day bank holiday, witness protection schemes, a diplomatic service, armed forces week, free parenting classes, and much more. The social engineering expansion will allow you see the game as less of a simple win\/lose challenge and more of a \u2018society sandbox\u2019 that gives you the power to change society over the long run whilst keeping everyone voting for you!","collection":810,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1391644800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1391644800000,"human":"2014-Feb-06","y":2014,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jsoloqdzl4lr67yaforn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jsoloqdzl4lr67yaforn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uegoezbaavkg57v1nfyj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uegoezbaavkg57v1nfyj","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mnfnhk0evibcbojat24f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mnfnhk0evibcbojat24f","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/smpwsp2kldpdha90ynpx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"smpwsp2kldpdha90ynpx","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/on2bi4gttzgp5jzthqpd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"on2bi4gttzgp5jzthqpd","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y4rwptyqrdoon0ztla7c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y4rwptyqrdoon0ztla7c","width":598,"height":288}}
