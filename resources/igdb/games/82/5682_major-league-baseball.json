The game follows most professional baseball rules and allows you to control all of the players on the team. You can throw a variety of pitches (from curve balls to fast balls), steal bases, tag players out, bunt, try for a home run, and in the event of a tie the game goes into extra innings! Several difficulty levels are available which control the game speed and whether or not stealing bases is allowed.","collection":2669,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[3540,3410,47334,28193,49988,6319,3531,45630,23819,11557],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536872078,536875054,536875138,536875140,536875199,536875282,536875570,536875749,536876138,536876139,536876140,536876141,536876142,536876143,536876144,536876145,536876146,536876147,536876148,536876149,536876151,536876152,536876155,536876156,536876157,536876159,536876165,536878125,536878341,536879692,536882367],"developers":[2521],"publishers":[2521],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[20,1166,4142,4226,4228,4287,4370,4658,4837,5226,5227,5228,5229,5230,5231,5232,5233,5234,5235,5236,5237,5239,5240,5243,5244,5245,5247,5253,7213,7429,8780,11455],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":347068800000,"platforms":[67,59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":67,"date":347068800000,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":347068800000,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Challenge Baseball\nBig League Baseball\nIntellivision Baseball","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Baseball"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar9cjjyl7n2f5osypgrz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar9cjjyl7n2f5osypgrz","width":256,"height":362},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
