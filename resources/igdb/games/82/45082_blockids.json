Players choose one of eight animated characters and prepare to compete against an assortment of colorful opponents whose fortresses must be breached. The object is to break a series of bricks by smashing a ricocheting ball into them using a horizontal paddle. \n \nThe default view is presented from an angled top-down perspective, but players can switch to a perspective right behind the paddle for a more 3D feel. New twists on the classic gameplay include the ability to bounce the ball over barriers as well as earn a special power-up by scoring a certain number of points.","popularity":1,"games":[25222,25646,60044,48273,14047,26223,36608,34919,56292,9507],"tags":[1,268435465,536873787,536875071,536876764],"category":0,"keywords":[2875,4159,5852],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1062633600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":1062633600000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Sep-04","y":2003,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zqddd9cfifon5bptogdy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zqddd9cfifon5bptogdy","width":320,"height":200},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
