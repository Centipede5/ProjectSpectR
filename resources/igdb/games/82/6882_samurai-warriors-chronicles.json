It was released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS. Samurai Warriors: Chronicles introduces several new features not included in prior Samurai Warriors games. While the top screen displays the main game, the bottom screen is used to display maps, KOs, and mission data. A player can switch between four characters during battle, switching the screen to their respective locations as well. Unlike previous titles, where the player chooses a hero and focuses on their story, in Chronicles the player chooses a male (wielding a dai-katana and rifle) or female (wielding dual swords) character which they play as a primary character in every story battle, following their own story and changing around different armies.","collection":763,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":50,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[12571,7213,37088,26769,18822,1907,12298,11133,36952,28380],"tags":[1,17,22,268435481,536871076,536871139,536871165,536871213,536871460,536871535,536872443,536872444,536873370,536873473,536873591,536875067,536875106,536875184,536875196,536875199,536875300,536875372,536875435,536875763,536875766,536875781,536875941,536876490,536877301,536878135,536878136,536878137,536878151,536878470,536879786,536879800,536880120,536880287,536883374,536883556,1073741826],"developers":[1394],"publishers":[858],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[164,227,253,301,548,623,1531,1532,2458,2561,2679,4155,4194,4272,4284,4287,4388,4460,4523,4851,4854,4869,5029,5578,6389,7223,7224,7225,7239,7558,8874,8888,9208,9375,12462,12644],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[25],"first_release_date":1298678400000,"platforms":[20,37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1301011200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Mar-25","y":2011,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1298678400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Feb-26","y":2011,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1301011200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Mar-25","y":2011,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1301184000000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Mar-27","y":2011,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Samurai Warriors 3D","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u6226\u56fd\u7121\u53cc \u30af\u30ed\u30cb\u30af\u30eb","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xvzrbh5pwcxauionsoyi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xvzrbh5pwcxauionsoyi","width":450,"height":270},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pldgfotu4uoq7cbiwb5b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pldgfotu4uoq7cbiwb5b","width":450,"height":270},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dshq8fhbstpnumbozqra.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dshq8fhbstpnumbozqra","width":450,"height":270},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bejnlftjwovvojtqvtrp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bejnlftjwovvojtqvtrp","width":450,"height":270},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nipqygu6nse2bjbcze4z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nipqygu6nse2bjbcze4z","width":450,"height":270},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lnngxwvcl9vl97mrx9cq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lnngxwvcl9vl97mrx9cq","width":450,"height":270},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wo85lohaydiriincwcri.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wo85lohaydiriincwcri","width":450,"height":270},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yvj0cqc9muic1xr3wzbg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yvj0cqc9muic1xr3wzbg","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iusshqapmgutckkffjxe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iusshqapmgutckkffjxe","width":320,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zisrmiiklopfyrn47k7d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zisrmiiklopfyrn47k7d","width":320,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rs5y6llzj1ueffq6vwxs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rs5y6llzj1ueffq6vwxs","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ib5bcqbg0g4k4p4gua1e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ib5bcqbg0g4k4p4gua1e","width":400,"height":240}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"n-63FYQ8P6E"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g1fbpoi47eatdfste213.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g1fbpoi47eatdfste213","width":250,"height":220},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action game in which players assume the role of an officer in battle who must fend off hordes of enemy soldiers to complete mission objectives. Players use swords, staffs, spears, and bows and arrows to kill enemies in various battlefield environments.

During the course of the game, sake and celebratory drinking are briefly referenced (e.g., 'If you drink this sake, I'll give you anything you want!' and 'What relaxes me is a good cup of sake.'). The words 'damn' and 'hell' appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.gamecity.ne.jp\/sengoku\/3ds\/"}]}
