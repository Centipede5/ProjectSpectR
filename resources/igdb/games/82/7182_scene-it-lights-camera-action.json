Over 1,800 original movie-themed questions are available across two game modes: Play Now and Party Play. Packaged along with the game are four custom wireless controllers featuring large colored buttons so players can quickly submit or \"buzz-in\" a multiple-choice answer before their opponents. \n \nFeatured categories include Child's Play, where a child's artwork is used to depict a movie scene; Quotables, where part of a film's dialogue is missing; Puzzle Picture, which scrambles an actor's image; Invisibles, where actors and other items have been removed from a scene; and Clip Study, which has players answering questions about a short clip. The game automatically keeps track of which questions have been already asked to minimize repeats.","collection":762,"rating":75,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":71,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":73,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":0,"games":[52432,100911,7282,103341,103388,18019,10898,103315,89073,33374],"tags":[40,268435482],"developers":[2275,2152],"publishers":[53],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2,4],"themes":[40],"genres":[26],"first_release_date":1194307200000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1194307200000,"human":"2007-Nov-06","y":2007,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/exx04wocqmixjasbrned.jpg","cloudinary_id":"exx04wocqmixjasbrned","width":219,"height":300}}
