It was released in early 2013 - two and a half decades after the last officially licensed SG-1000 game, The Black Onyx in 1987. The game is relatively simple - all the user must do is dodge asteroids while travelling upwards. The game is available in both cartridge and cassette form. \n \nThe SG-1000 is one of many platforms to receive this game. The basic concept was created by Revival Studios in 2008 for CHIP-8 compatible systems of the late 1970s before being retooled for the Magnavox\/Philips Odyssey\u00b2 in 2011. Near identical copies to this SG-1000 version are available for the ColecoVision and MSX.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1363910400000,"platforms":[84],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":84,"date":1363910400000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Mar-22","y":2013,"m":3}]}
