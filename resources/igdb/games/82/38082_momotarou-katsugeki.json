The same concept would later be seen in the Momotaro Thunderbolt games for Game Boy. \n \nMomotaro Katsugeki (\"Momotaro Action Movie\") is a side-scrolling action-platformer from Hudson that uses their Momotaro character who is better known as the star of the Momotaro Dentetsu and Momotaro Densetsu series. It is a PC Engine exclusive and never saw international releases. \n \nMomotaro Katsugeki seems influenced by and plays similarly to Westone's Wonder Boy in Monster Land and the sequels that followed: the goal is to move across a set of 2D stages, and the player can talk to NPCs for hints and to purchase better equipment with the money they find. There is also a world map that links the various stages together. \n \nThe concept of a 2D side-scrolling action game featuring Momotaro would be further explored by Hudson with the two Game Boy Momotaro Dengeki\/Thunderbolt games.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,68324,1070,1073,10039,56589,1188,47823,51485,12632],"tags":[1,268435464,536871208,536872961],"category":0,"keywords":[296,2049],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":656467200000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":656467200000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Oct-21","y":1990,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Momotarou Katsugeki","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qsvvnobqlf6jkjyjha7x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qsvvnobqlf6jkjyjha7x","width":320,"height":324}}
