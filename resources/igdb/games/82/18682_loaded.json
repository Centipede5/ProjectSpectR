{"id":18682,"name":"Loaded","slug":"loaded","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/loaded","created_at":1460087988328,"updated_at":1545039111319,"summary":"Loaded (known as Blood Factory in Japan) is a science fiction-themed top-down shoot 'em up video game that was developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Interplay. Loaded was released on December 12, 1995 on the PlayStation, and was ported to the Sega Saturn the following year. The game had origins in DC Comics as well as the more adult-orientated Vertigo Comics, and there was a small graphic novel based on the game. The six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains, anti-heroes, psychopaths, perverts, mutants, and flamboyant murderers. They are, however, the last hope to stop the intergalactic supervillain code-named F.U.B. and save the universe. The characters were created and designed with contributions from Garth Ennis of Vertigo Comics and Greg Staples of 2000AD.\nLater in the same year the game spawned a sequel using almost entirely the same characters and the same game engine, albeit one with mildly improved graphics, named Re-Loaded. Re-Loaded was released on the PlayStation and PC at the end of 1996. Although it did not enjoy as good sales as its predecessor, it did however have an acclaimed soundtrack, this time entirely written and recorded by Neil Biggin.\nThe game discs of both games could be played as audio CDs. Both games were notorious for their macabre sense of humor, over-the-top violence and extreme gore.","storyline":"Take on the psychotic persona of one of six chronically pissed-off homicidal mutants and blast out of the brutal planet RAULF so you can slash and splatter your way across a lawless and unforgiving 3D morphing galaxy. Radical terrain-morphing effects turn the laws of physics upside down. Blister the ground beneath your feet, create huge explosions, send shock waves of death, and more!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":75,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[68287,55038,36950,18954,11156,90099,28029,103020,18857,9019],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870981,536871015,536871041,536871078,536871139,536871213,536871882,536871937,536873064,536874182,536874947,536875198,536875258,536875305,536875330,536875358,536875435,536875453,536875484,536875526,536875572,536876120,536876348,536880224,536880441,536880761,536882166,1073741827],"developers":[578],"publishers":[5],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[69,103,129,166,227,301,970,1025,2152,3270,4035,4286,4346,4393,4418,4446,4523,4541,4572,4614,4660,5208,5436,9312,9529,9849,11254],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":818726400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":818726400000,"region":2,"human":"1995-Dec-12","y":1995,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":823824000000,"region":1,"human":"1996-Feb-09","y":1996,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":826848000000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Mar-15","y":1996,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Blood Factory (JP)","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c2wbjr07abwbnds1kcys.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c2wbjr07abwbnds1kcys","width":639,"height":478},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dyqkr4giwuczo1oquwf4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dyqkr4giwuczo1oquwf4","width":637,"height":479}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"ls-8VvEPQAk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/thkrwofgwtwqih2canyh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"thkrwofgwtwqih2canyh","width":950,"height":950},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Loaded_(video_game)"}]}
