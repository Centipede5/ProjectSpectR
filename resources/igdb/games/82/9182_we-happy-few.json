From a first-person perspective, players explore Wellington Wells, interact with citizens, collect various items, and fight hostile citizens. Players use pipes, axes, bone saws, and explosives to attack and kill enemies. Combat is highlighted by splashes of blood and cries of pain. Some scenes depict corpses lying in pools of blood or hanging from nooses. In one sequence, characters can be seen inside a club wearing rubber suits and zapping each other with electric batons; characters are depicted making suggestive moaning sounds and caressing themselves when shocked. During the course of the game, players' character can ingest pills (Joy) that cause hallucinations when overused; some areas also include hallucinogenic mushrooms and whiskey that cause screen distortion or discoloration when consumed. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wehappyfew"},{"category":2,"url":"https:\/\/wehappyfew.gamepedia.com\/We_Happy_Few_Wiki"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/wehappyfewgame.com"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ContrastGame\/videos"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/We_Happy_Few"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/320240"}],"external":{"steam":"320240"}}
