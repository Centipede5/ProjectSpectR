As players complete mission objectives, they use swords, axes, and spears to kill enemy warriors in melee-style combat. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies are killed; some areas depict large bloodstains and impaled heads on spikes. Players can also perform finishing attacks (e.g., decapitation, impalements) that are sometimes highlighted by close-up camera angles. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: bound warriors decapitated by swords; characters executed with weapon strikes to the head.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/304390"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ForHonorGame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ForHonorGame"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/For_Honor"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/forhonor.wikia.com\/wiki\/For_Honor_Wiki"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/forhonorgame.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"304390"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":8,"offlinemax":0}]}
