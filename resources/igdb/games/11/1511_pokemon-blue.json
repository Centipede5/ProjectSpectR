Professor Oak, a famous Pok\u00e9mon researcher, explains to the player that wild Pok\u00e9mon may be living there, and encountering them alone can be very dangerous. He takes the player to his laboratory where the player meets Oak's grandson, a rival aspiring Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. The player and the rival are both instructed to select a starter Pok\u00e9mon for their travels out of Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. Oak's Grandson will always choose the Pok\u00e9mon which is strongest against the player's starting Pok\u00e9mon. He will then challenge the player to a Pok\u00e9mon battle with their newly obtained Pok\u00e9mon, and will continue to battle the player at certain points throughout the games. \nWhile visiting the region's cities, the player will encounter special establishments called Gyms. Inside these buildings are Gym Leaders, each of whom the player must defeat in a Pok\u00e9mon battle to obtain a total of eight Gym Badges. Once the badges are acquired, the player is given permission to enter the Pok\u00e9mon League, which consists of the best Pok\u00e9mon trainers in the region. There the player will battle the Elite Four and finally the new Champion: the player's rival. Also, throughout the game the player will have to battle against the forces of Team Rocket, a criminal organization that abuses Pok\u00e9mon. They devise numerous plans for stealing rare Pok\u00e9mon, which the player must foil.","collection":314,"franchise":60,"franchises":[60],"rating":86.83029935456601,"popularity":5.333333333333333,"total_rating":86.83029935456601,"total_rating_count":161,"rating_count":161,"games":[22387,1512,1517,1514,1558,2933,3222,25921,55092,43165],"tags":[17,35,38,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871010,536871022,536871159,536871160,536871208,536871257,536871321,536871327,536871390,536871423,536871425,536871433,536871533,536871641,536871938,536871939,536872010,536872371,536872419,536872712,536872781,536873362,536874706,536875006,536875075,536875196,536875214,536875233,536875326,536875330,536875337,536875397,536875434,536875438,536875537,536875538,536875580,536875587,536875637,536875639,536875648,536875652,536875675,536875755,536875791,536875832,536876004,536876073,536876090,536876205,536876232,536876287,536876332,536876357,536876546,536876615,536876642,536876645,536876652,536876870,536876910,536877008,536877046,536877075,536877314,536877940,536877991,536878065,536878225,536878299,536878324,536878366,536879310,536879434,536879577,536879578,536879579,536880043,536880171,536880587,536880588,536880590,536880593,536880595,536880596,536880600,536880602,536881613,536881614,536881615,536881618,536881792,536882407,536882408,536882411,536883939,536884215,536886187,536886191,536886192,1073741827,1073741828],"developers":[1617],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[78,98,110,247,248,296,345,409,415,478,511,513,521,621,729,1026,1027,1098,1459,1507,1800,1869,2450,3794,4094,4163,4284,4302,4321,4414,4418,4425,4485,4522,4526,4625,4626,4668,4675,4725,4727,4736,4740,4763,4843,4879,4920,5092,5161,5178,5293,5320,5375,5420,5445,5634,5703,5730,5733,5740,5958,5998,6096,6134,6163,6402,7028,7079,7153,7313,7387,7412,7454,8398,8522,8665,8666,8667,9131,9259,9675,9676,9678,9681,9683,9684,9688,9690,10701,10702,10703,10706,10880,11495,11496,11499,13027,13303,15275,15279,15280],"themes":[17,35,38],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":831686400000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[47,37,33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1456531200000,"region":1,"human":"2016-Feb-27","y":2016,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1456531200000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Feb-27","y":2016,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":831686400000,"region":5,"human":"1996-May-10","y":1996,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":906940800000,"region":2,"human":"1998-Sep-28","y":1998,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":909100800000,"region":3,"human":"1998-Oct-23","y":1998,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":939081600000,"region":1,"human":"1999-Oct-05","y":1999,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":47,"date":1456531200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Feb-27","y":2016,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pocket
