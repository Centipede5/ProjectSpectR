In South Korea, it is known as Ageo Nara (\uc545\uc5b4\ub098\ub77c), which roughly translates to \"Crocodile's Land\". \n \nGameplay is identical to Berlin no Kabe, except C both breaks and destroys a block and you only need one hit to destroy a block. Special items collected throughout the levels are used with B. Each world has nine normal levels, an autoscrolling level forcing you to climb to the boss's chamber, a boss, and then another bonus round.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,10039,55752,1188,51485,26848,69569,60079,13936],"tags":[1,268435464,536872407,536872961],"category":0,"keywords":[1495,2049],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":699494400000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":699494400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Mar-02","y":1992,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c3kna3urnulfeggua0f3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c3kna3urnulfeggua0f3","width":1534,"height":2100}}
