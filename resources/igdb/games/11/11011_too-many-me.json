If it isn't easy to jump through a Canabalt or a Bit Trip Runner, just imagine what it's going to be like when you control simultaneously an army of clones!","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/inkmhu2umrwmdqbtypxs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"inkmhu2umrwmdqbtypxs","width":480,"height":660}}
