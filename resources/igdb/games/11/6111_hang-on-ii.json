The only difference is downgraded graphics and the addition of music from the arcade version. Meanwhile, Super Hang-On is the direct sequel to the arcade game. \n \nIt is compatible with the BH-400 bike handle controller, and would be the only SG-1000 game designed for it (though the peripheral is compatible with the Sega Master System and Sega Mega Drive).","collection":878,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,58785,36662,40470,12347,32551,67625,14857,67685,64284],"tags":[268435466,536870969,536872983,536874337,536875069,536875117,536877185],"category":0,"keywords":[57,2071,3425,4157,4205,6273],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[84],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":84,"date":504835200000,"region":5,"human":"1985-Dec-31","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":84,"date":504835200000,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30cf\u30f3\u30b0\u30aa\u30f3II"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/edsth21r4l8hagazg5ps.jpg","cloudinary_id":"edsth21r4l8hagazg5ps","width":557,"height":761}}
