Team up as Gumball, Darwin, and Anais to take down the mutant leftovers! \n\nDESTROY ALL LEFTOVERS!\nDad's expired jelly has mutated everything in the Watterson's refrigerator!

Dish out the destruction across 30 different levels! \n\nCHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER!\nSwitch between Gumball, Darwin, and Anais to defeat swarms of mutant food. Each character has his or her own special abilities. Gumball throws a rampaging temper tantrum; Anais uses the power of Daisy the Donkey to heal her teammates; and Darwin uses a bubble shield to block attacks.\n\nMANLY POWER-UPS!\nMan up! Give your characters manly mustaches to transform them into burly fighters. Or lock and load with the tennis ball cannon. That rotten grub won't stand a chance.\n\nMUTANT FRIDGE MAYHEM - It's the ultimate food fight!\n\n\n**************** \n\nIf you're having problems with this app, contact us at advanced.platforms@turner.com.
