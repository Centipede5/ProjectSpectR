Players fire at flying on-screen ducks using a rifle with a light gun attached to the end. Your shots would appear on the screen as you fired, ducks would \"veer\" away from missed shots. If a duck was shot it would fall into the marsh to be retrieved by your on-screen digital dog. The coin-op incorporated a unique alarm system that if the gun was stolen or tampered with the game would emit a loud buzzing sound.","collection":3699,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11253,22690,79967,79040,20812,18467,54662,28029,64120,18154],"tags":[32,268435461,268435470,268435486,536871286,536871846,536872078,536875666,1073741825],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[374,934,1166,4754],"themes":[32],"genres":[5,14,30],"first_release_date":131587200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":131587200000,"region":2,"human":"1974-Mar-04","y":1974,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fqimdwdjhukbtyddmikk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fqimdwdjhukbtyddmikk","width":214,"height":320}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qk3vcgcq90qznm69whx8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qk3vcgcq90qznm69whx8","width":277,"height":359},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Qwak!"}]}
