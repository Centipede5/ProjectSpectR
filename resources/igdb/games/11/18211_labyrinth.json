{"id":18211,"name":"Labyrinth","slug":"labyrinth","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/labyrinth","created_at":1457301639245,"updated_at":1523406530921,"summary":"Labyrinth is a bold and innovative new Collectible Card Game (CCG) adventure that allows  players  to experience  the  depth  of  traditional  CCGs and  the  action  of  tactical role-playing games in an immersive 3D universe. \nIn Labyrinth,  players are both Adventurers and Dungeon Masters.  As Adventurers they must assemble a powerful deck of Heroes and then invade rival dungeons and engage in epic player vs. player 3D battles to capture loot. As Dungeon Masters, they will use the loot from conquests to customize their own dungeons and put together a powerful deck of Bosses, Monsters and Trap cards to defend their riches at all costs.\nAn additional level of strategy is introduced as multi-player battles are fought asynchronously, which means each player can take their time to plan their defense.\nLabyrinth is set in a vast and wondrous city called Starfall.  Once a peaceful and thriving market city, age-old pacts and alliances have broken down creating turmoil and unrest.  The  earliest  settlers  have  consolidated  their  power  and  look  to  push  out  rivals  while newcomers to the city seek to carve out territory for themselves.  As night falls, a silent war  begins  in  the  tunnels,  alleys,  and  halls  of  the  ancient city  and  every  player  must battle for survival.","rating":87.58620689655172,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":73,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80.29310344827586,"total_rating_count":8,"rating_count":7,"games":[75813,33603,36962,55888,25311,65827,16468,32283,74929,72412],"tags":[268435468,268435471,268435488],"developers":[9346],"publishers":[9346],"category":0,"game_modes":[2],"genres":[12,15,32],"first_release_date":1457308800000,"status":4,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1457308800000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Mar-07","y":2016,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uqt2spirlaw5ftq7iiwc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uqt2spirlaw5ftq7iiwc","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/psgylgxgo3ljllqrejdp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"psgylgxgo3ljllqrejdp","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wse1bgxb4duwg5djogys.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wse1bgxb4duwg5djogys","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fw6t1akss1s6ahtbfprq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fw6t1akss1s6ahtbfprq","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hpdhn4t88puplnnmezj3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hpdhn4t88puplnnmezj3","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"6U4eGed7QC4"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"I82WbSv6n6Y"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/myddabomjdfzqwvmfwuh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"myddabomjdfzqwvmfwuh","width":1280,"height":487},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/412310"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/labyrinththegame.com"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LabyrinthOracle"}],"external":{"steam":"412310"}}
