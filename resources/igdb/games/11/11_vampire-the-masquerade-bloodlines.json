The game depicts the fledgling's journey through 21st-century Los Angeles to uncover the truth behind a recently discovered relic that heralds the end of all vampires. \n \nBloodlines is presented from first- and third-person perspectives. The player assigns their character to one of several vampire clans\u2014each with unique powers, customizes their combat and dialog abilities and progresses through Bloodlines using violent and nonviolent methods. The selection of clan affects how the player is perceived in the game world, and which powers and abilities they possess; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely between the available hubs: Santa Monica, Hollywood, downtown Los Angeles, and Chinatown.","storyline":"The game plunges players into the dark and gritty vampire underworld of modern-day L.A. as a creature of the night. Players will develop their character's powers, interact with other characters and embark on story-driven quests as they battle mortals and other vampires with an incredible array of vampire powers and weapons.","collection":15,"rating":89.6245839083814,"popularity":9.666666666666666,"aggregated_rating":72.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":80.97895862085736,"total_rating_count":248,"rating_count":244,"games":[12,41,1009,1887,80,9630,529,9498,472,11118],"tags":[1,17,19,20,268435461,268435468,268435481,536870928,536870984,536871041,536871052,536871071,536871117,536871123,536871134,536871138,536871139,536871196,536871208,536871365,536871470,536871506,536871599,536871610,536871758,536871894,536871938,536871944,536872032,536872070,536872164,536872201,536872225,536872232,536872257,536872371,536872435,536872451,536872611,536872626,536872647,536872666,536872715,536872798,536872799,536872957,536873176,536873362,536873591,536874182,536874398,536875044,536875046,536875050,536875055,536875057,536875151,536875158,536875162,536875199,536875252,536875257,536875275,536875281,536875307,536875319,536875358,536875398,536875405,536875420,536875455,536875483,536875492,536875503,536875535,536875572,536875682,536875762,536875764,536875767,536875790,536875796,536875830,536875831,536875893,536875957,536876022,536876078,536876103,536876125,536876176,536876262,536876301,536876332,536876337,536876338,536876383,536876384,536876386,536876429,536876443,536876458,536876590,536876641,536876647,536876652,536876660,536876690,536876704,536876706,536876812,536876838,536876911,536876919,536876991,536877077,536877162,536877204,536877207,536877252,536877275,536877324,536877371,536877374,536877375,536877394,536877514,536877531,536877533,536877645,536877725,536877919,536877955,536877974,536877976,536877987,536877995,536878018,536878069,536878085,536878263,536878317,536878349,536878481,536878489,536878494,536879022,536879059,536879062,536879188,536879795,536879905,536879915,536880086,536880294,536880409,536880417,536880565,536880650,536880709,536880782,536880925,536881009,536881079,536881122,536881267,536881456,536881590,536881716,536881995,536882082,536882445,536882759,536882967,536883079,536883206,536883849,536884022,536884027,536885629,536885949,536886402,536886403,536886404,536886405,536886406,536886407,536886408,536886409,536886410,536886411,536886412,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[117],"publishers":[66,1],"game_engines":[3],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":36000,"normally":97200,"completely":216000},"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[16,72,129,140,159,205,211,222,226,227,284,296,453,558,594,687,698,846,982,1026,1032,1120,1158,1252,1289,1313,1320,1345,1459,1523,1539,1699,1714,1735,1754,1803,1886,1887,2045,2264,2450,2679,3270,3486,4132,4134,4138,4143,4145,4239,4246,4250,4287,4340,4345,4363,4369,4395,4407,4446,4486,4493,4508,4543,4571,4580,4591,4623,4660,4770,4850,4852,4855,4878,4884,4918,4919,4981,5045,5110,5166,5191,5213,5264,5350,5389,5420,5425,5426,5471,5472,5474,5517,5531,5546,5678,5729,5735,5740,5748,5778,5792,5794,5900,5926,5999,6007,6079,6165,6250,6292,6295,6340,6363,6412,6459,6462,6463,6482,6602,6619,6621,6733,6813,7007,7043,7062,7064,7075,7083,7106,7157,7173,7351,7405,7437,7569,7577,7582,8110,8147,8150,8276,8883,8993,9003,9174,9382,9497,9505,9653,9738,9797,9870,10013,10097,10167,10210,10355,10544,10678,10804,11083,11170,11533,11847,12055,12167,12294,12937,13110,13115,14717,15037,15490,15491,15492,15493,15494,15495,15496,15497,15498,15499,15500],"themes":[1,17,19,20],"genres":[5,12,25],"first_release_date":1100563200000,"pulse_count":7,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1100563200000,"region":2,"human":"2004-Nov-16","y":2004,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1100822400000,"region":1,"human":"2004-Nov-19","y":2004,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"VTMB
