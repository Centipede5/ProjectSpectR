In some mini-games, players use light sabers and telekinetic powers to battle fantastical creatures (e.g., aliens and robots) in melee-style combat; enemies collapse to the ground when killed. In one sequence, players assume a first-person perspective to shoot down alien spaceships\u2014these frenetic battles are accompanied by laser fire and large explosions. Another sequence allows players to control a giant creature that rampages through city streets to attack civilians; cries of pain and crunching sounds can be heard as humanoid characters are thrown, stomped on, and eaten. In the dancing mini-game, some female characters perform suggestive moves (e.g., gyrating their hips\/buttocks) and wear revealing outfits (partially exposed cleavage\/buttocks). The words \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201chell\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/733050"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/nestoryavorskyy"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kinect_Star_Wars"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/starwars.wikia.com\/wiki\/Kinect_Star_Wars"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
