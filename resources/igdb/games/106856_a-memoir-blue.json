She is reflecting on childhood memories of her mother and a day trip they once took to a neighboring city. Rather than recalling these events as they actually occured, she remembers the day from the perspective of her younger self, transforming the experience into a magical journey of the imagination. As Miriam thinks back on these events, her emotions surge as if experiencing the trip for the first time once again.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[82117,27744,26298,34919,37419,28277,99307,28465,35099,86344],"tags":[268435488,536871045,536871130,536872351,536872608],"developers":[16139],"game_engines":[509],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[133,218,1439,1696],"genres":[32],"first_release_date":1567296000000,"status":5,"platforms":[6,39,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1567296000000,"human":"2019-Sep-01","y":2019,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1567296000000,"region":2,"human":"2019-Sep-01","y":2019,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1569888000000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Oct-01","y":2019,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5qj6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5qj6","width":1000,"height":563},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5qj5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5qj5","width":1000,"height":563},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5qj4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5qj4","width":1000,"height":563},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jbxlr03f2oc04n2aagoi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jbxlr03f2oc04n2aagoi","width":2000,"height":1111},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wkspentwn57fupg5ylgy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wkspentwn57fupg5ylgy","width":1900,"height":1070}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar4gj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar4gj","width":1100,"height":733},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar4gk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar4gk","width":1100,"height":786}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"251982132"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hqv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hqv","width":500,"height":667},"websites":[{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/amemoirblue"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cloisters_i"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/memoirblue.weebly.com"}]}
