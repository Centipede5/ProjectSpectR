Players mostly punch and kick opponents to drain their health meters; fighters also use special moves that can include weapons (e.g., oversized guns, swords, lasers), energy blasts, or magic spells. Combat is highlighted by battle cries, impact sounds, and light effects. A gallery of still images occasionally depicts characters with drops of blood on their faces or bodies; an opening cutscene also shows a handful of figures with blood on their faces. The gallery also contains images of female characters in provocative poses (e.g., arms covering bare breasts, characters bent over), or with partially exposed buttocks and breasts. The dialogue contains some sexual remarks: \u201c[Y]ou c*ck-blocked me all those years ago!\u201d \u201cOhhhh, you mean that pedophile?!\u201d \u201cJust stay away from me, you perv!\u201d \u201cI haven't played with those boobies in forever!\u201d and \u201cI'm in fetish paradise!\u201d The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201ca*shole,\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.blazblue.jp\/cp\/special_extend.html"}]}
