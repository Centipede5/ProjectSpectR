Developed specifically for VR, Star Trek: Bridge Crew is the only game to offer a true-to-life level of immersion in the Star Trek universe. \n \nIn Star Trek: Bridge Crew, the Federation dispatches you and your crew to command the new vessel U.S.S. Aegis as part of a critical initiative. Your mission: explore a largely uncharted sector of space known as The Trench, in hopes of locating a suitable new home world for the decimated Vulcan populace. The Trench contains stunning beauty and undiscovered wonders, but also strange anomalies and dangers yet unknown. The Klingon Empire is also active in the region, and their purpose is undoubtedly a threat to the Federation\u2019s plans. It\u2019s up to you and your crew to chart the sector to determine the Klingons\u2019 aims, and to secure a peaceful Federation presence.","collection":3440,"franchise":18,"franchises":[18],"hypes":4,"rating":80,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":71.8333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":7,"total_rating":75.91666666666666,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":0,"games":[19301,36926,17130,34823,25311,36950,13200,19448,19575,17686],"tags":[18,268435468,268435469,536870935,536870936,536870963,536871882,536871931,536872361,536875134,536875146,536875351,536875794,536875795,536882999,536883010,536883468,536888695,536888935,1073741825,1073741831],"developers":[717],"publishers":[104],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,7],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[23,24,51,970,1019,1449,4222,4234,4439,4882,4883,12087,12098,12556,17783,18023],"themes":[18],"genres":[12,13],"expansions":[101122],"first_release_date":1496102400000,"pulse_count":49,"platforms":[6,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1496102400000,"region":1,"human":"2017-May-30","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1496102400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-May-30","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1496102400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-May-30","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1496102400000,"region":8,"human":"2017-May-30","y":2017,"m":5}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rxycgg7ahndafizvmq8r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rxycgg7ahndafizvmq8r","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jwsum5rdm0dhnxywe55n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jwsum5rdm0dhnxywe55n","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/obk5wtpu8awjdhcaa8cy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"obk5wtpu8awjdhcaa8cy","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/epz2whwz78umwcaxlfjw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"epz2whwz78umwcaxlfjw","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xwqsuzhl47rzm1fxokwa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xwqsuzhl47rzm1fxokwa","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"m42TO1dePWg"},{"name":"E3 2016 Reveal Trailer","video_id":"drcHz0m_vBw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zmjrvtwkeci2kabkjdas.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zmjrvtwkeci2kabkjdas","width":7802,"height":9234},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a VR strategy simulation game in which players assume the role of an officer aboard the Starship Enterprise.
