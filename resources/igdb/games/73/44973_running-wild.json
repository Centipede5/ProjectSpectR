The courses, taking place in remote locations such as the arctic, jungle, and desert, are littered with hazards and power-ups to both aid and hinder your progress. The former is made up of a plethora of obstacles such as pipes, ice and lava pits, thorn patches, and other such impediments, many of which must be cleared using your animal's innate jumping ability. \n \nThe power-ups provided allow characters to fly; turn into ghosts in order to avoid obstructions; transform the course into mud or ice or even increase in size in order to squash any competitors in their path. Speed strips are scattered about the locales and will provide much-needed boosts when run over.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[40470,28856,54789,36662,55192,5905,62781,14857,25443,77793],"tags":[268435466,536875056,536875069,536875088,536875194,536875590,536876927,536876995,536879779,536882290],"category":0,"keywords":[4144,4157,4176,4282,4678,6015,6083,8867,11378],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":909705600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":909705600000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Oct-30","y":1998,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gtzvs0ikqbq5ujm04ilp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gtzvs0ikqbq5ujm04ilp","width":325,"height":383},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
