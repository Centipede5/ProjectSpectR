Offroad Fury 4 introduces MX bikes, dune buggies, and trophy tricks into the mix. The game also differs from it's predecessors in that it includes long point-to-point tracks, which utilize streaming technology to immerse the player in a huge seemingly-endless world. The other notable departure from the previous titles is the inclusion of a career mode, which attempts to include a story between races using rendered cutscenes.","collection":1111,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":76.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":76.3333333333333,"total_rating_count":4,"games":[8274,36662,28856,8271,8270,22690,69810,40470,18267,3610],"tags":[268435466,268435470,536870969,536871564,536871712,536872078,536872983,536875069,536875464,536877424,536878376,536879831,536883028,536884018,1073741826],"developers":[2569],"publishers":[45],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[57,652,800,1166,2071,4157,4552,6512,7464,8919,12116,13106],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":1162252800000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1162252800000,"region":2,"human":"2006-Oct-31","y":2006,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hc7vttzata3usadxiupl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hc7vttzata3usadxiupl","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jhfcos8h4wvwfnrecwoe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jhfcos8h4wvwfnrecwoe","width":400,"height":565},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
