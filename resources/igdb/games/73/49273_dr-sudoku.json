The rules are simple: start with a grid consisting of nine three-by-three squares in which some of the numbers are already supplied. Fill in the blank squares so that each column, row, and three-by-three grid contains a number from 1 to 9 with none repeated. \n \nDr. Sudoku for the Game Boy Advance is the first of a series of Sudoku products from Mastiff. The GBA title features 1,000 hand created puzzles, Original Mode (which lets you create you own Sudoku puzzles,) a tutorial mode, help for those moments when you really are stuck, the ability to \"pencil in\" possible solutions, and a puzzle problem creation mode.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"keywords":[2244,2875],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1148601600000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1148601600000,"region":8,"human":"2006-May-26","y":2006,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a8xorhayvi7noe9o0xkw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a8xorhayvi7noe9o0xkw","width":640,"height":640},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
