It was later sold as Kung Fu Superkicks when the license for the use of the name Chuck Norris expired. The game was produced for the Commodore 64, Commodore VIC-20, Atari 2600, and Colecovision as part of Xonox's double-ender cartridge line (cartridges with two games and two connectors that were flipped over depending on which one the user wanted to play). \n \nThe player is a martial arts expert that has to liberate a hostage.
