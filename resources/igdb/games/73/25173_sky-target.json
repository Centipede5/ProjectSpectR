No multiple lives are given, but you get a life bar (which can be replenished in-flight) to help you outlast your enemies.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28751,8422,18088,103020,14758,64311,37419,15536,10039,34919],"tags":[1,268435461,268435469,268435489,536870913,536871213,536872390,536872651,536873753,536874398,536874745,536875171,536876296,536876739,536876740,536876744,536876746,536877494,536880851,536884033,1073741826],"developers":[6002],"publishers":[4981],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,301,1478,1739,2841,3486,3833,4259,5384,5827,5828,5832,5834,6582,9939,13121],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,13,33],"first_release_date":820368000000,"platforms":[52,6,32],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":861926400000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Apr-25","y":1997,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":872208000000,"region":2,"human":"1997-Aug-22","y":1997,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":871516800000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Aug-14","y":1997,"m":8}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"lRP-E0vkTxg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hcdly3q5m7kfvipilexj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hcdly3q5m7kfvipilexj","width":800,"height":1222}}
