As its corrupting shadow spread across the land, peaceful creatures known as Solari were transformed into savage Lunari, attacking towns and cities for months until the effect faded. In recent times, Moonrises have been rare, sometimes separated by centuries, and their corruption lasting mere days. But that\u2019s changing now, as the cycle intensifies once again, and the world faces an age of danger and uncertainty. \n \nNow it\u2019s time for you to set off on a grand adventure to protect your world and fulfill your destiny to become a master Warden.","storyline":"In Moonrise, you are a Warden, fresh out of school and ready to assume the responsibility to keep communities safe from Lunari \u2014 once-friendly Solari that have been transformed by the corrupting effects of Moonrise. \nAs you explore the world and the story, you learn about the history of the world of Moonrise as well as the Moonrise phenomenon itself. You discover different regions and interact with the characters that call those regions home. You go on quests, battle and cure wild Lunari, befriend Solari, challenge other Wardens, and explore dungeons as you work to protect the world from the Lunari threat.","hypes":2,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[36263,35994,27092,36198,22747,55092,25311,17192,17130,89560],"tags":[268435471,268435487,536871938,536875046,536876228,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[1433],"publishers":[1433],"game_engines":[25],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1,2,3,5],"keywords":[1026,4134,5316],"genres":[15,31],"status":6,"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q0iydayhyjghhinlpjwn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q0iydayhyjghhinlpjwn","width":1904,"height":1071},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tlxdsnvjtcmfbarrpebb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tlxdsnvjtcmfbarrpebb","width":610,"height":343},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/seot5fvj7te6hncb5vyp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"seot5fvj7te6hncb5vyp","width":1904,"height":1071}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"wOuLFx5X5eM"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"tcexqY64iuw"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"Ja6B3572LSM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mncs9wuukj9k1v8emjwq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mncs9wuukj9k1v8emjwq","width":668,"height":227},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/moonrisegame.com\/"}]}
