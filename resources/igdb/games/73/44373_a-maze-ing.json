Options include \"Cheese Hunt\" (collect 10 pieces of cheese in the right order before you are shown the exit), \"Escape Maze\" (Get to the exit as fast as you can), \"Mouseholes\" (shortcuts through the maze walls) or \"Obstacles\" (which blocks the center of the passages), whether there are cats (and how many) in the maze, how fast they are, and whether the cats are smart or dumb. Try to beat your own best time, or play with another player choosing between co-operative or competitive play.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,25646,25311,25640,18167,8197,60044,26223,19934,14047],"tags":[1,268435465,268435471,536871599,536873787,536875241,536875280,536875941,536876373],"category":0,"keywords":[687,2875,4329,4368,5029,5461],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":349833600000,"platforms":[129],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":129,"date":349833600000,"region":8,"human":"1981-Feb-01","y":1981,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lvct0vbmjth0btrcr6ku.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lvct0vbmjth0btrcr6ku","width":560,"height":420}}
