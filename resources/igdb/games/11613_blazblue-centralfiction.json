Characters mostly punch and kick each other in an attempt to drain opponents' health meters. Each character can utilize large-scale special attacks, and several characters use weapons such as pistols, clubs, mannequins, and swords. Action is highlighted by impact sounds and cries of pain. Cutscenes sometimes depict characters impaled on swords or with bloodstains on faces and\/or clothing. Several female characters wear low-cut clothing, revealing large amounts of cleavage; some characters have several discussions regarding breasts (e.g., \u201cThe moment Nine grabs my breast, I need to activate all of the Breasty Voice power that I have. . .\u201d; \u201cAre men so dumb a pair of t*ts is all it takes to brainwash them!?\u201d; \u201cYou let Litchi touch your breasts on purpose?\u201d). Gallery images sometimes show female characters in provocative poses (e.g., a character grabbing at\/pulling down her underwear). Some scenes briefly depict female characters partially nude, with their hair or arms covering their breasts and genitalia. The word \u201csh*t\u201d appears in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Violence in a sporting context - Sexual images and\/or sexual innuendo - Mild bad language - Images or sounds likely to be horrifying","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.h2interactive.co.kr\/games\/bbcf\/pc\/en\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BlazBlue:_Central_Fiction"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/blazblue.wikia.com\/wiki\/BlazBlue:_Centralfiction"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/586140"}],"external":{"steam":"586140"}}
