This is rough and tumble, no holds barred hockey action that will challenge your stick-handling skills as well as your head-bashing abilities. While the traditional rules of hockey apply, that doesn't mean you can't throw an elbow or a high stick when the ref isn't looking. And since this is two-on-two hockey, the action is fast and furious as you try to outscore and outslug your opponent in four-player hockey action.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}]}
