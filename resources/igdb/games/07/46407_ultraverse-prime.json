Prime can punch, kick and jump, and combine these into some new moves and combos. The player as well as the enemies can also occasionally find weapons or objects to pick up and throw. Some stages are much faster as Prime flies at a fast speed and needs to punch obstacles and enemies out of the air.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[71455,25300,36950,25311,68287,27314,19448,26766,29147,23175],"tags":[1,18,268435481,268435487,536870926,536871882,536871894,536873299],"category":0,"keywords":[14,970,982,2387],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[25,31],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[78],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":78,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Prime \/ Microcosm","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mb0frrrss170xork1mwd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mb0frrrss170xork1mwd","width":1539,"height":2156}}
