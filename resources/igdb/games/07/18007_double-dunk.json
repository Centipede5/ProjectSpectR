{"id":18007,"name":"Double Dunk","slug":"double-dunk","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/double-dunk","created_at":1455487735143,"updated_at":1515657342366,"summary":"Double Dunk is a simulation of two-on-two, half-court basketball. Teams have two on-screen characters, a shorter \"outside\" man and a taller \"inside\" man. In a single-player game, the player controls the on-screen character closest to the ball, either the one holding the ball (on offense) or the one guarding the opponent with the ball (on defense). In two-player games, each player may control one of the two teams as in a one-player game, or both players may play on the same team against a computer-controlled opponent. At the start of each possession, both offense and defense select from a number of plays (such as the \"pick and roll\" on offense), then attempt to score or regain possession of the ball by intercepting or stealing it from the offense. The game offers a number of player-selectable options. Games can be set to last a certain amount of time or until one team scores a certain number of points. Three-point shots can be turned on or off, as can a ten-second shot clock. Players may also choose to include foul detection and\/or a three-second lane violation.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,81281,80876,80865,80456,80412,79667,79593,79464,79309],"tags":[268435470,536872078],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1166],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sdejcqjrhcuabuj4koz9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sdejcqjrhcuabuj4koz9","width":341,"height":467}}
