Elvin has assembled a crack team of robots within his high-security tower - the only way to stop him unleashing them is to destroy them first. \n \nGameplay is puzzle-oriented as before, although the levels are now scrolling, and as such much larger than before. Each one contains objects to pick up to enable you to take on the level's final puzzle of putting them together in sliding-block form. There are lots of bonus games, ranging from a Simon title to standard shoot 'em ups.","collection":1617,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,37094,71455,25300,36950,19174,27314,28029,64204,10039],"tags":[1,18,268435464,268435465,536870979,536871851,536871882,536872131,536873064],"category":0,"keywords":[67,939,970,1219,2152],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8,9],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":16,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Impossible Mission 2025: The Special Edition","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f39l6j6jvpqpqjp788aq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f39l6j6jvpqpqjp788aq","width":550,"height":659}}
