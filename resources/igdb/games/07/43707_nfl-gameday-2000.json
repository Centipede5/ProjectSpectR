Well in this scenario, the quarterback is not the retired John Elway, but his replacement Bubby Brister, and the game is not a live broadcast but another go at 989 Studio's NFL GameDay 2000. The 2000 edition features more balanced plays, better CPU AI (including a pre-snap AI scheme), and more than 200 new motion captured animations.","collection":4637,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"keywords":[26,27,1148,1166,4228,4274,4650,5573,6774,7179,7180,7213,8209,8738,8739,8741,8742,8743,8744,8745,8746,8748,8756,8758,13119,13951],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":935971200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":935971200000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Aug-30","y":1999,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v9nksfdgavcwmmvnpezl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v9nksfdgavcwmmvnpezl","width":541,"height":646},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
