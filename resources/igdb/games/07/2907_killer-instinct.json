{"id":2907,"name":"Killer Instinct","slug":"killer-instinct","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/killer-instinct","created_at":1376833364707,"updated_at":1547386609513,"summary":"Killer Instinct is a fighting game developed by Rare and published by Midway and Nintendo. It was released as an arcade game in the fall of 1994 and, the following year, ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and the Game Boy. The game's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organising a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.\n\nKiller Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced \"auto-doubles\", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are \"combo breakers\", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.","storyline":"Ultratech is a very powerful megacorporation which organises a tournament called Killer Instinct. Along with regular participants, experimental creatures created by Ultratech also fight in the tournament so their strength can be tested. Ultratech also discovers a technology to make bridges between dimensions, and releases a two-headed, one-eyed, satyr monster called Eyedol from this dimensional prison.","collection":542,"hypes":1,"rating":76.6621921689824,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":0,"total_rating":73.33109608449121,"total_rating_count":35,"rating_count":35,"games":[103269,76253,103312,10039,103288,113378,91140,103301,99737,1626],"tags":[1,268435460],"developers":[771],"publishers":[70,566,771],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":783302400000,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[52,19,33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":809740800000,"human":"1995-Aug-30","y":1995,"m":8},{"category":2,"platform":33,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":783302400000,"human":"1994-Oct-28","y":1994,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pajqjvovpd1zid5b4hvk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pajqjvovpd1zid5b4hvk","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tfoknmdwxogo2jobktkx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tfoknmdwxogo2jobktkx","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dn0emgp9frlsyutzrzjq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dn0emgp9frlsyutzrzjq","width":320,"height":248},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m9haatwoi12q91wmaexy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m9haatwoi12q91wmaexy","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ctw3k3snro1bbfj5bf4h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctw3k3snro1bbfj5bf4h","width":256,"height":239}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"t2CR1LWGba8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/puzpihjejc5dtngpglhf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"puzpihjejc5dtngpglhf","width":550,"height":395},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.doublehelixgames.com\/killer-instinct-character-highlight-ft-thunder\/"}]}
