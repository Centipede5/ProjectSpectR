Twins Jennie and Tom were having a pleasant frolic through the forest, until they came across a strange, unknown path... and were ambushed by a pair of goblins. The two mischievous creatures won't tolerate any twins in the forest other than themselves, so they hatch a wicked plan to separate the children. Here, the player takes control of one of the siblings (either Tom or Jennie) as the other is abducted by the goblins.","popularity":1,"publishers":[16791],"category":0,"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5j67.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5j67","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5j66.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5j66","width":320,"height":200}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1h8r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1h8r","width":320,"height":200}}
