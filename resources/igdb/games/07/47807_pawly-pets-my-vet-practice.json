With the game My Vet Practice this dream can come true. Build up your own practice, decide when to build which building and which patient to treat. Every day people come to you with their animals, guinea pigs, rabbits, budgerigars, cats, dogs and even horses. Sometimes it can even be necessary to accommodate the animals and take care of them for a couple of days, so that they get well and happy again quickly. Therefore you can build extra stables and accomodations. Feeding, playing with the pets, bear company, but also cleaning up and the daily treatment are your duties. For very demanding horse-patients, you can experience interesting things about horse whispering. But although the work with pets is a lot of fun, even the best vet doctor needs some time out. Then you take your own horse and go for a long ride at the beach, on meadows and fields or through the nearby forest. Stock up new energy to become the best vet doctor of all time.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[13],"first_release_date":1172793600000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1172793600000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Mar-02","y":2007,"m":3}]}
