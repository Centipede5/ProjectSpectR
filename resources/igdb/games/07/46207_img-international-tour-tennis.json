Game modes include exhibition, tour and tournament for both singles and doubles. \n \nAlong the usual offering of lobs, volleys, passing shots, top spins and slashes, the player can leave player movement to the console, and just focus on hitting the ball with the right shot with the correct timing (the player can also set the playing style, from all-court, baseline, or rush net). For those needing a boost of confidence before entering competitive play, Vic Braden, one of the most well known tennis coaches, has a court with special lines, a ball machine and some hints to help them improve their play.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46234,47338,37127,70715,61245,47609,47601,44453,20641,3456],"tags":[268435470,536871223,536872078,536875176,536875177,536876437],"category":0,"keywords":[311,1166,4264,4265,5525],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":772156800000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":772156800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Jun-21","y":1994,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pdxakvogbu89lvvquwww.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pdxakvogbu89lvvquwww","width":223,"height":318}}
