Because the Master League is so big, it's split it into 4 zones, with 2 divisions & cup competitions in each zone. Other than most of the Italian teams, club names are fictional, as are many of the players.However, the game has an improved edit mode, so you can edit the team's name, flag, logo, the team shirts, stadium. \n \nYou can use the 'shop' system to unlock hidden features such as classic teams.The game also has a training mode, and a challenge mode, in which you have to dribble around cones has quick has you can. Replays can be fast-forwarded and rewound, and the view can be rotated. The advantage rule is now implemented, so a foul will only stop play if the fouled team suffers for it.","collection":195,"rating":74.7757942254724,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":87.25,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":81.0128971127362,"total_rating_count":23,"rating_count":18,"games":[4643,698,49195,699,27014,4645,103377,7574,102805,503],"tags":[32,268435469,268435470,536870938,536870939,536871049,536871906,536872060,536872637,536873715,536874813,536875073,536875138,536875186,536875271,536875430,536875431,536875433,536875456,536875523,536875749,536876259,536876719,536877432,536877491,536877938,536878090,536878111,536878112,536878114,536878125,536880441,536880735,536882361,536882395,536883601,1073741827],"developers":[159],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[26,27,137,994,1148,1725,2803,3901,4161,4226,4274,4359,4518,4519,4521,4544,4611,4837,5347,5807,6520,6579,7026,7178,7199,7200,7202,7213,9529,9823,11449,11483,12689],"themes":[32],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":1066348800000,"platforms":[6,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1081468800000,"region":2,"human":"2004-Apr-09","y":2004,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1077148800000,"region":5,"human":"2004-Feb-19","y":2004,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1069372800000,"region":1,"human":"2003-Nov-21","y":2003,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1077148800000,"region":5,"human":"2004-Feb-19","y":2004,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1076976000000,"region":2,"human":"2004-Feb-17","y":2004,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1066348800000,"region":1,"human":"2003-Oct-17","y":2003,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"pes","comment":"Other"},{"name":"PES 3","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"World Soccer: Winning Eleven 7 International","comment":"North American title"},{"name":"World Soccer: Winning Eleven 7","comment":"Japanese title"}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Tmo9cJkqNU4"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"qvaHYwbw_xg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nbp5z57t9qn0ibkubbix.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nbp5z57t9qn0ibkubbix","width":1200,"height":1485},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for all persons.","rating":1},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pro_Evolution_Soccer_3"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/football.wikia.com\/wiki\/Pro_Evolution_Soccer_3"}]}
