Escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life by visting far off locales and going on tours (complete with cards that help randomize the trip), lounging on the beach, roughing it in the middle of the forest on a camp-out, and much more \u2013 either alone or as part of a group.\nIt\u2019s not all exploring new areas, of course. Your sims can be treated to the lap of luxury by getting a massage and tan or swim in the ocean, build a sand castle \u2013 even discover a secret technique from a mysterious stranger. After communing with Mother Nature, don\u2019t be surprised if you Sims have a bit more spring in their step when they return to their normal life. \nAfter all, who doesn\u2019t feel great after a nice, relaxing vacation?","collection":61,"rating":66.6681127982646,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":73.3340563991323,"total_rating_count":8,"rating_count":7,"game":224,"games":[29173,55590,31515,35463,55036,18425,34823,7508,36346,55689],"tags":[268435469,268435471,536870955,536871441,536871906,536872060,536872074,536874694,536875432,536875832,536876571,536876718,536878103,536878324,536879696,536880294,536880847,536882083,1073741827],"developers":[2296],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[278],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[43,529,994,1148,1162,3782,4520,4920,5659,5806,7191,7412,8784,9382,9935,11171],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":1188864000000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1188864000000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Sep-04","y":2007,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1189123200000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Sep-07","y":2007,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1197849600000,"human":"2007-Dec-17","y":2007,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The Sims 2: World Adventure"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tin59dvj6g564mmrpp3f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tin59dvj6g564mmrpp3f","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xclql276t53eeybyxmwf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xclql276t53eeybyxmwf","width":1024,"height":774}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"L-METtIdokI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wdkfm9k7tkzvhsnp2czg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdkfm9k7tkzvhsnp2czg","width":256,"height":365},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.ea.com\/the-sims-2-bon-voyage"}]}
