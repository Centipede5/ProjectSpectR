She's sent to the area after all communications are cut off and an entire company of Marines disappears without a trace. \nThe game is indeed a lot like Zelda II, with its overworld map and side-on battles. Except there are no dungeons as such, only a few interior locations such as a school and hospital to explore. The basic premise is that protagonist Lila has to wander the town, rounding up surviving townsfolk and marines, and leading them back to a church.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55289,59516,36608,25311,1221,23175,16468,37088,72412,37022],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}]}
