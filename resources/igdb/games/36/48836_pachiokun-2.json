It was published by Coconuts Japan. \n \nPachiokun 2 is the sequel to Pachiokun, and was also published by slot machine manufacturer Coconuts Japan as well as developed by contract developers Marionette and C Dream. As with the first game, the goal is to help a sentient pachinko ball named Pachio-kun bankrupt a series of pachinko parlors and liberate all his miniature brethren from their flashy mechanical gulags. \n \nThe game introduces Pachio-kun's wife, presumably named Pachio-chan. If she's upset about her husband's gambling addiction, she never shows it.","collection":3763,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[43130,27266,23175,28277,63734,38141,14605,17469,59516,72412],"tags":[268435487,536871641,536871710,536875074],"category":0,"keywords":[729,798,4162],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":602121600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":602121600000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Jan-30","y":1989,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":604800000000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Mar-02","y":1989,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qkrfljfyaxki1rywc1xe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qkrfljfyaxki1rywc1xe","width":300,"height":204}}
