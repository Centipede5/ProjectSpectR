Players punch, kick, and use special attacks (e.g., guns, fireball, ice blasts, lighting strikes) to drain opponents' life meters. Battles are accompanied by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and exaggerated impact sounds; large blood-splatter effects occur during fights, staining characters' bodies and the ground. Some additional attacks include X-ray views of opponents' bones, ligaments, and organs shattering\/bursting apart. After an opponent is defeated at the end of a match, players perform finishing moves called \"Fatalities\" that can result in characters' impalement, dismemberment, or decapitation. Many of these finishing moves depict over-the-top instances of violence: a character ripped in half; a character's face sliced off with a sword; a character mauled in half, leaving entrails exposed. The words \"f**k,\" \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mortal_Kombat_X"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/mortalkombat.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mortal_Kombat_X_(2015_video_game)"},{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/mortal-kombat-x\/id949701151?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/307780"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.mortalkombat.com"}],"external":{"steam":"307780"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
