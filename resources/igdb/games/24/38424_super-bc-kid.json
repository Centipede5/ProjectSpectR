Super Bonk allows Bonk to travel through time from his prehistoric levels, the insides of a dinosaur, a version of modern Chinatown, and even the moon! Along the way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a dinosaur form called \"Big Kronk\", find candies that change his size from tiny to huge, travel through transportation tubes, and find multiple bonus levels. \n \nBonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!","popularity":1,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}]}
