The game is based around an alien invasion during a festival, and the four heroes (Ultraman, Kamen Rider, Knight Gundam from Gundam and Fighter Roar, a character created for The Great Battle series). \n \nThe game has a mix of genres. The chief gameplay is a platformer where the player can leap up and down floors similar to Ninja-Kid or Mr. Goemon. If the player enters a flying gate, they are escorted to a shoot 'em up stage in which they control a flying lobster fighting samurai heads and Maneki Nekos. \n \nThe Great Battle Gaiden 2 follows the Game Boy game Tekkyu Fight! The Great Battle Gaiden, released the previous year. Like every The Great Battle game and its Japanese pop culture-specific heroes, the game was never localized into English.","collection":4376,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[55752,10039,36868,44177,56589,26848,48553,10209,11588,79786],"tags":[27,268435461,268435464,536871078,536871208,536871262,536872961],"category":0,"keywords":[166,296,350,2049],"themes":[27],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":762393600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":762393600000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-28","y":1994,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pvadcbcyza2ioufpzmx3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pvadcbcyza2ioufpzmx3","width":500,"height":885}}
