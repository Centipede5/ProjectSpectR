An enormous laser-eyed space serpent is coiled around the mountain, and you have to take it down single-handedly. Once See the videoyou\u2019ve baked the snake, you land your sled on the surface and have a shootout with Gryptogg, Raygoth and Arkus. Once you\u2019ve beaten them back, you can explore the underground caverns, collecting their instruments of evil and exchanging fire with them again. When you escape from their maze, you advance to the next level and begin the fight anew. (North American Philips \/ Probe 2000, 1983 \u2013 unreleased) \n \nThis Colecovision adaptation of the Odyssey2 game (now there\u2019s a phrase you\u2019re never going to see again), based on a less-than-blockbuster-successful series of comics and action figures, adds more depth to the game than the dear old Odyssey ever could\u2019ve managed. But it\u2019s hard to tell how much depth, as the game was never completed. \n \nThe \u201csnake\u201d screen, though it\u2019s much more impressive visually than its counterpart on the Odyssey2, is just plain boring. The O2 edition of Power Lords also forced you to dodge earthbound meteors and an \u201cartificial black hole\u201d within the volcano that could drag you to your doom if you got on a horizontal line of sight with it when it opened. On the Colecovision, all you have to contend with are enemy vehicles and a slow-moving snake. It takes more time than effort to clear this screen, and it\u2019s ultimately a bit boring. \n \nThe other screens, which aren\u2019t even hinted at in the Odyssey2 version of the game, are also a bit tedious \u2013 enemy A.I. and combat programming obviously weren\u2019t finished when the game was abandoned. You can exchange fire with your interestingly-animated opponents, but sometimes they just stop firing and disappear. Convenient, sure, but not terribly exciting. \n \n\u201cProbe 2000\u201d was an imprint \u2013 akin to Atari\u2019s \u201cAtarisoft\u201d division \u2013 opened by North American Philips to release games for hardware other than the Odyssey2, which was by now firmly into its twilight. The only game actually released by Probe 2000 was War Room, programmed by Bob \u201cRoSHa\u201d Harris (who created Killer Bees on the O2). Probe 2000\u2019s next release would\u2019ve been either Power Lords or the impressive RPG Lord Of The Dungeon (which was left in limbo because its battery-backed-up cartridge, capable of saving the player\u2019s position, was an idea that just wouldn\u2019t be practical until the NES era). The intellectual property rights to Pink Panther had been snagged by N.A.P. for the Odyssey2 and other systems, but the only version of that game that has ever surfaced has been an incredibly rare Atari 2600 prototype. N.A.P. ultimately got out of the game business, leaving both the Odyssey2 and Probe 2000 behind.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[68],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":68,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zr7tnv39z3ovc9gk6eod.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zr7tnv39z3ovc9gk6eod","width":1081,"height":791}}
