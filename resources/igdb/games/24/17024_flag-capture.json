It can best be compared to a very early and primitive Minesweeper. One or two players must attempt to discover which tile a flag is hidden under. Players are given clues such as directional arrows which indicate the flags location, or numeric tiles which indicate the flag's distance. Players must also watch out for bombs which explode if revealed.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76731,55036,25640,29173,19934,25646,25311,55590,23345,19376],"tags":[1,268435465,268435471,536874694,1073741827],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[3782],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":283910400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":283910400000,"region":2,"human":"1978","y":1978,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Capture"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/paie4icqz1u1zdznxuzd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"paie4icqz1u1zdznxuzd","width":600,"height":829}}
