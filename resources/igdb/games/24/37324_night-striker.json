It is a futuristic on-the-rails shooter which plays similarly to Sega's Space Harrier, though has you pilot a hover vehicle instead. \n \nThe game was brought to the Sega Mega-CD in 1993, where graphically it was downscaled for the weaker hardware. It was also brought to the Sega Saturn as Night Striker S (\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e9\u30a4\u30ab\u30fc\uff33) in 1996 - essentially the same game, but with an extra \"Saturn Mode\" and a few small enhancements. No versions have ever left Japan.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a3mrh3vgbkf50bkjeole.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a3mrh3vgbkf50bkjeole","width":1280,"height":720}}
