Welcome to the other side of Mother Nature. A disturbing side where survival surpasses cannibalism and ends up in solitude. The Huntress will never miss her mark, she will track you, capture you and kill you. Hopefully a former rugby star might bring her down...if he doesn\u2019t get lost in the Red Forest. \n \nForest of the damned \n \nSurvival is all. \nThere are no limits to what one abandoned child will do to make it through the day, year after year after year. Meat holds no face when it\u2019s placed above a fire to be cooked. All she seeks is shelter and a long-lost mother that nature took away. Her simple cottage is all that is left - a mad girl\u2019s paradise in a forsaken forest. Might Mr. King stand a chance against the forces of nature...once it unleashes The Huntress? \n \nA Lullaby for the Dark is a new Chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map.\"","popularity":1.666666666666667,"game":18866,"tags":[1073741826,1073741825],"developers":[1260],"publishers":[12898],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[541],"themes":[1,19,23],"first_release_date":1501113600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1501113600000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jul-27","y":2017,"m":7}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"9sXTC-uzjWM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wb2lm2yncuen2sja3bkl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wb2lm2yncuen2sja3bkl","width":720,"height":293},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/661770\/Dead_by_Daylight__A_Lullaby_for_the_Dark_Chapter"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.deadbydaylight.com\/chapter5\/"}]}
