The premise of the game is that V.E.N.O.M. have kidnapped Scott Trakker and are holding him on the moon. The player controls Matt Trakker (unrecognizable in a space suit with helmet) through a series of static screens featuring platform puzzles and obstacles which must be overcome using the powers of the various masks. The player can hold up to four masks at a time, but can only use the power of one at a time. The masks can also be exchanged at certain points in the game. This game received the best reviews of the trilogy, despite the deviation from the franchise's storyline and style.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,142,71455,27314,27523,25300,14364],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871882,536871937,536875054],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1025,4142],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5]}
