Using a top-down perspective, players position heroes on a grid-based map and perform sword slashes, arrow strikes, and magic spells to defeat enemies (e.g., goblins, orcs, and wolves). Enemies react to damage by crying out and staggering back; they disappear in a stream of smoke when defeated. During the course of the game, some characters are depicted with blood-stained bandages and bloody wounds on their chests.","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4},"external":{"steam":"33670"}}
