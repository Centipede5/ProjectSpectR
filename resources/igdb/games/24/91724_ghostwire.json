Some are shy. Some are evil. And some will only interact with you if you bring them something they want. \n \nWhat's more, factors like time of day and light levels will further challenge your ghost hunting abilities, but a wide range of upgradeable equipment is available to help you communicate with the other side.","storyline":"Ghostwire is a collection- and adventure game, where you use your handheld device to communicate with ghosts. \n \nYour portable device is used as a portal to the astral plane, and helps you find and collect ghosts that exist all around you. \nIn your quest you use real tools, such as the built-in camera and microphone, as well as abstract ones like an \"EMF tuner\" for tracking down the ghosts. \n \nOnce you find the spirits, you document them and find out why they haunt our world. They also give you riddles to solve. \nUltimately, you will help them find peace.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,11296,18011,26658,51524,25646,21641,56033,33822,18225],"tags":[19,268435487,536871047,536871363,536871939,536872032,536873850,1073741831],"developers":[15756],"publishers":[14586],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[7],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[135,451,1027,1120,2938],"themes":[19],"genres":[31],"platforms":[39,159],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":39,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":159,"human":"TBD"}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ghostwire: Link to the paranormal"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ze2ot2uovoanurhbf4wl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ze2ot2uovoanurhbf4wl","width":256,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wdbu93czkeaticbsk3xg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdbu93czkeaticbsk3xg","width":800,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"jIlxo-X5t5w"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rfayiuzryriced9g4c1k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rfayiuzryriced9g4c1k","width":333,"height":445},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ghostwiregame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/GhostwireGame"}]}
