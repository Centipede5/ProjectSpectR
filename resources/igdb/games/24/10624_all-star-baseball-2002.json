You may choose to play as one of the current teams, or you can go back to the past and play as people like Nolan Ryan or Reggie Jackson. You can also create your own player and\/or team. \n \nThe featured game modes are Quick Play, Exhibition, All-Star Game, Season, Series, Home Run Derby and Batting Practice. Batting is cursor based, and you can choose between a power or a contact swing - for the latter there are even more options available, e.g. trying to hit the opposite field. Batting is similar in as you choose your itching style (every athlete can have up to six in his repertoire) and then choose the location.","collection":1550,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11558,54662,10663,44242,18623,69229,22470,29173,22425,26145],"tags":[32,268435469,268435470,536870932,536872060,536872078,536875138,536875435,536875562,536875570,536876150,536876165,536876190,536876973,1073741826],"developers":[2005],"publishers":[287],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[20,1148,1166,4226,4523,4650,4658,5238,5253,5278,6061],"themes":[32],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":984787200000,"platforms":[21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1006041600000,"region":2,"human":"2001-Nov-18","y":2001,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":984787200000,"human":"2001-Mar-17","y":2001,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pepogahqfbrw7kuarns7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pepogahqfbrw7kuarns7","width":640,"height":818},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
