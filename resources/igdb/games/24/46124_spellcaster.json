The player explores temples and defeats enemies like ghosts, ninja, and feral beasts. There are also villages to explore and people to talk to as the player assembles clues on who desecrated his home town's temple and killed its guardians. The quest takes the player across medieval Japan and to the Underworld. Unlike most games, death does not lead to game over or even a loss of money or experience points. Instead, the player has to use a password in order to resurrect themselves from the dead.","collection":5088,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[47823,36926,11567,25300,7329,19561,44076,55092,7709,19333],"tags":[1,17,19,268435461,268435464,268435468,268435481,268435487,536870973,536871006,536871041,536871078,536871139,536871208,536871327,536871470,536871894,536871937,536871938,536871939,536871945,536871971,536872032,536872435,536872961,536873370,536873591,536875053,536875222,536875294,536875830,536876036,536876220,536876286,536876522,536876761,536877005,536877611,536878004,536878045,1073741828,1073741825],"developers":[11739],"publishers":[11739],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[61,94,129,166,227,296,415,558,982,1025,1026,1027,1033,1059,1120,1523,2049,2458,2679,4141,4310,4382,4918,5124,5308,5374,5610,5849,6093,6699,7092,7133],"themes":[1,17,19],"genres":[5,8,12,25,31],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[64],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":64,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Kujaku\u014d","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Kujaku Ou","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dg79jxnfxmohmrpmqsfr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dg79jxnfxmohmrpmqsfr","width":1436,"height":2000}}
