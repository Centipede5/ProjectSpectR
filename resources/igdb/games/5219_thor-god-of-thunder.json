In the game, Thor battles through the numerous worlds of Norse mythology that span realms ranging from primal worlds of fire and ice to extraordinary planets inhabited by Frost Giants and Trolls to save Asgard, the capital city of the Norse Gods. Thor must overcome monstrous foes lifted from the pages of the comics including Ulik, Ymir, and Surtur, as well as other monstrous denizens. Players will wield the iconic Mjolnir, Thor's legendary hammer, to fight enemies on an immense scale while controlling the elemental storm powers of lightning, thunder, and wind to vanquish enemies. As Thor earns Valor points through his exploits, players can acquire new abilities, powers, and weapon upgrades.","franchise":350,"franchises":[350],"rating":80,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":51.8333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":65.91666666666666,"total_rating_count":12,"rating_count":2,"games":[5181,14763,19565,501,55092,23733,5503,20329,475,11397],"tags":[1,268435487,536870926,536871213,536871580,536871706,536871931,536871945,536872205,536873299,536873810,536873863,536874398,536874452,536874745,536875046,536875054,536875106,536875131,536875157,536875199,536875257,536875271,536875293,536875294,536875419,536875437,536875488,536875621,536875717,536875736,536875753,536875803,536876029,536876069,536876171,536876220,536876325,536876606,536876648,536876694,536876819,536876980,536877063,536877443,536877532,536877791,536878223,536878281,536878513,536882289,536883454,536883921,536892621,536892622,1073741826],"developers":[474,391,1021],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,301,668,794,1019,1033,1293,2387,2898,2951,3486,3540,3833,4134,4142,4194,4219,4245,4287,4345,4359,4381,4382,4507,4525,4576,4709,4805,4824,4841,4891,5117,5157,5259,5308,5413,5694,5736,5782,5907,6068,6151,6531,6620,6879,7311,7369,7601,11377,12542,13009,21709,21710],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1304035200000,"platforms":[9,12,20,37,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1304035200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Apr-29","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1304380800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-May-03","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1304640000000,"region":1,"human":"2011-May-06","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1304380800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-May-03","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1315526400000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Sep-09","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1315872000000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Sep-13","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1304121600000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Apr-30","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1304380800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-May-03","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1304380800000,"human":"2011-May-03","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1304380800000,"human":"2011-May-03","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1304380800000,"human":"2011-May-03","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1304380800000,"human":"2011-May-03","y":2011,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1315872000000,"human":"2011-Sep-13","y":2011,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Thor: The Video Game","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k7i2jkom2nvp1lfffhwz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k7i2jkom2nvp1lfffhwz","width":256,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qxaojojvgqogpy9netam.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qxaojojvgqogpy9netam","width":256,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mzpiabso7rsloqfpomtj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mzpiabso7rsloqfpomtj","width":256,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o77qceuq1hhkfzsqd2dk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o77qceuq1hhkfzsqd2dk","width":256,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bxyw9aynkrpbojcaakgk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bxyw9aynkrpbojcaakgk","width":256,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/or6tluzzhtlkws7tcxuv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"or6tluzzhtlkws7tcxuv","width":256,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/behddd5ntfncvr91fadz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"behddd5ntfncvr91fadz","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/higo5t0bwgg6e32difcw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"higo5t0bwgg6e32difcw","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/boj1ivigcczgkaff18uu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"boj1ivigcczgkaff18uu","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zq0edekxivfgfsake38u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zq0edekxivfgfsake38u","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sdxw3nisrmzz6dlhs2nr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sdxw3nisrmzz6dlhs2nr","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mpamcq7uumaod1fvgzvh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mpamcq7uumaod1fvgzvh","width":650,"height":365}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wunrfz4lmkduuoyzclb4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wunrfz4lmkduuoyzclb4","width":256,"height":269},"esrb":{"synopsis":"3DS Version:\r\nThis is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Thor, a mythical god who battles evil forces.

Battles can become somewhat frenetic; loud explosions and punching sounds are heard during each attack, and defeated enemies disintegrate into the air. In one cutscene, a couple of characters are slashed in half and impaled with a sword, resulting in brief splashes of yellow liquid.","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.sega.com\/thor\/"}]}
