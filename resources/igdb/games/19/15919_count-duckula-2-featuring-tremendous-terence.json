Duckula hates cute things, and he soon realizes that if he and his pals stay on this planet for any length of time, they too will become... Cute... aagghh!\n\nAll the cuties dollies and teddybears want to give our pal a big wet kiss (Blah) to speed up the cuteness process.\n\nThere's only one thing for it. Duckula, Igor and Nanny have got to get off this planet and quick, but they have lost the lightning conductor in the crash landing and they will need this to escape. Can Tremendous Terence help? Will they get away? It's up to you.","collection":1763,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cbezi9n85nqlyihz0tap.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cbezi9n85nqlyihz0tap","width":617,"height":569}}
