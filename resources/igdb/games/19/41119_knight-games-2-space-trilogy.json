Set in the year 3002, it consists of three different futuristic games: \"Combat Robot\", \"In Orbit\" and \"Final Tournament\". \n \nCombat Robot: Based on Dropzone, the player controls Robby the Robot in a two-way horizontal scrolling game. The goal is to pick up friendly robots while blasting enemies. Once a robot is picked up he can be taken back to base and dropped. \n \nIn Orbit: Flying about Earth in another two-way horizontal scrolling game, the player has to blast enemy ships while trying to load supplies in orbit over the planet. The game then switches to a 3D view behind the player's ship as it heads for the loading bay. \n \nFinal Tournament: Reminiscent of the first game, this part is a competition in three events of armed combat: Jet Joust, Light Sabres and Photon Chains. Each event is viewed from the side on a single screen. The goal is to defeat one's opponent and get a high score. This part can be played by one or two players.","collection":2849,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75962,46815,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704],"tags":[268435460,1073741826,1073741828],"publishers":[11647],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[18],"genres":[4,5],"first_release_date":547257600000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":547257600000,"region":1,"human":"1987-May-06","y":1987,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v3ra7rrsdbj9f2exjjku.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v3ra7rrsdbj9f2exjjku","width":2384,"height":3069}}
