Your Interwand Starship is equipped to do battle with the enemy guard towers and spaceships of the planet Antiwand. \n \nYour mission is to destroy the guard towers that protect the underground enemy settlement and enter the secret tunnel that leads to Antiwand. You must constantly be on the alert and attack the guard towers before they collide with and destroy your Starship. When you have destroyed 10 towers, you will go to Level 2 where you can enter the underground world of the Antiwands. It is here that you will do battle with Antiwand spaceships and underground missile command towers which will try to destroy your Starship. \n \nThe more Antiwand towers you destroy, the more the attack speed of the towers increases and the tunnel itself grows more and more narrow making your journey more perilous than ever.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}]}
