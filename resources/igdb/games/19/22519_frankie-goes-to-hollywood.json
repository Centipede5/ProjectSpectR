After discovering a gruesome murder, your interest in something greater than the routine of 80s Liverpool is awoken. \n \nYou explore the streets and houses in the search of a way out. The main basis of the game involves picking up objects and using them in the correct way - most objects have more than one potential use, and misusing them is the only way the game can be lost. There are several sub-games along the way, including shoot 'em ups, a maze and a jigsaw puzzle.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[27314,29525,36950,28148,59516,23175,13189,28029,26192,28552],"tags":[1,43,268435461,268435487,536871186,536871939,536872179,536875054,536876292,536879691,1073741828],"developers":[3951],"publishers":[1271],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[274,1027,1267,4142,5380,8779],"themes":[1,43],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cg9zfrfrofgyyknrqvio.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cg9zfrfrofgyyknrqvio","width":1000,"height":1374},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frankie_Goes_to_Hollywood_(video_game)"}]}
