On the first, a simple platform arrangement, the bells are set into the floor and walking over them will collect them. Each level of the platform screen is connected by the bell ropes at either end which go up and down. Hazards include arrows and fireballs which must be ducked or jumped, while on subsequent screens there are bats, birds and axes. On the seventh screen, which is inside the castle belfry, the working mechanisms of the clock threaten him. On completing the seventh screen, the game returns to screen one with an increased level of difficulty.","collection":2536,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,55752,19289,26223,25646,37094,47823,37088,36926,51485],"tags":[1,22,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871063,536871208,536871939,536872961,536873787,1073741828],"developers":[1271],"publishers":[1271],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,296,1027,2049,2875],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[8,9,31],"first_release_date":468115200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":468115200000,"region":2,"human":"1984-Nov-01","y":1984,"m":11},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b2mrkpf2ubjsqgqzxzzm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b2mrkpf2ubjsqgqzxzzm","width":1000,"height":1453}}
