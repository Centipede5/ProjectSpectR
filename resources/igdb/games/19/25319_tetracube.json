This game has beautiful three-dimensional graphics and its black and green theme intended to give off a futuristic \"matrix\" vibe. \n\nThe game has a very simple concept, yet it is very challenging for players. This is what makes it addictive.  The concept of the game was inspired by Nokia's \"Rapid Roll\" game. \n\nThe objective of the game is to increase your score by making sure the keep lands on the green elevating platforms at all times. If the cube touches the walls or any of the red platforms - Game Over.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[54999,51485,41064,36794,76065,24199,22819,95667,75202,27964],"tags":[268435489,536871783,536873403],"developers":[11406],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[871,2491],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":1475107200000,"status":2,"platforms":[34],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1475107200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-29","y":2016,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vsqcdtnig5srxg9yqmvu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vsqcdtnig5srxg9yqmvu","width":512,"height":512},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.SamuraiCodex.TetraCube&hl=en"}]}
