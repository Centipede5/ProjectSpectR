The premise is that, as a street racer, the player must impress other drivers with quick but stylish driving in a series of challenges. These challenges are in sets of ten (called Chapters - there are 25 in total), with completion of all challenges opening the next chapter (assuming the player has enough Kudos, see below) and unlocking a new car. Each challenge is on a different track, and unlocking a challenge unlocks that track in the time-attack and multiplayer modes.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":90,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":90,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[40470,54789,44242,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,39755,55590],"tags":[268435466,268435469,536871313,536872060,536872695,536873364,536875069,536875154,536876698,536876973,536881349,536882304,536884031,536884431,536886043,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[1208],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[401,1148,1783,2452,4157,4242,5786,6061,10437,11392,13119,13519,15131],"genres":[10,13],"first_release_date":973209600000,"platforms":[23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":973209600000,"human":"2000-Nov-03","y":2000,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MSR ","comment":"Other"}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"p0OzDfR63d0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ort5onsb8acdkkoocobh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ort5onsb8acdkkoocobh","width":1418,"height":1393},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
