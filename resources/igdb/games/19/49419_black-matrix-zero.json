The game is set in the same fictional world as the original Black\/Matrix game, though hundreds of years prior. Three divisions of humankind share the same world - white-winged people who are called angels, black-winged people who are called devils, and wingless people. Those who have wings have great powers and pay little mind to the wingless ones. The angels rule the world via a religious organization called the Prodevon Church, which ensures both the cooperation and ignorance of the wingless people.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":1033344000000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1033344000000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Sep-30","y":2002,"m":9}]}
