Players engage in quests to gain experience and skills as well as quests that require killing various human soldiers, boars, orcs, giant rats, and zombies. Hand-to-hand combat with swords and magic often results in brief splashes of red blood. During the adventure, players can purchase alcohol (e.g., beer and ale) or encounter characters drinking alcoholic beverages and speaking with slurred speech. Quest objectives may also require players to engage in missions to find specific items, including a parcel of tobacco. Some female characters are depicted with exaggerated proportions, and all customizable characters can be stripped down to their underwear. Players can also encounter characters who make suggestive comments (e.g., '\u2026Danos really did sleep with that barnyard cow Firniane!' and 'Ms. Iriane offers certain... umm, services...').","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language.","rating":3}}
