As described on the box, it contains five of the poorest games submitted to Firebird.\nInstead of rejecting the submissions, they decided to mock the original developers by releasing them together and publicly brand it as \"unoriginal\" and \"awful\". Firebird even disowned all their copyright to the game and encouraged buyers to pirate it at will.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[65832,72373,28213,28113,40470,19934,54789,1905,44076,34919],"tags":[1,27,268435466,268435469,536871186,536871262,536871396,536871489,536871533,536871641,536871872,536872060,536872211,536872407,536872695,536872847,536873064,536874706,536875069,536875074,536875240,536875330,536875650,536876304,536880627],"publishers":[1375],"category":0,"keywords":[274,350,484,577,621,729,960,1148,1299,1495,1783,1935,2152,3794,4157,4162,4328,4418,4738,5392,9715],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[10,13],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":504835200000,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Don't Buy This: Five of the Worst Games Ever"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tdtjw12wvywlsmybqpue.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tdtjw12wvywlsmybqpue","width":271,"height":205},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dffldlocokmhbns6tnne.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dffldlocokmhbns6tnne","width":267,"height":203}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c9jtwpleh3dlzofqtxqd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c9jtwpleh3dlzofqtxqd","width":251,"height":395}}
