{"id":28768,"name":"Shoot The Rocks","slug":"shoot-the-rocks","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/shoot-the-rocks","created_at":1494780795250,"updated_at":1515756837237,"summary":"Anyone who has ever been into arcade, computer, or video games will have heard of Atari's 1980 arcade classic Asteroids. Dozens of versions and tributes to the game, both official and unofficial, have been created for virtually every computer, console, handheld, tablet, phone, and operating system in the decades since its original release. It is undoubtedly a classic from the golden era of arcade games. \n \nShoot The Rocks is a little different in that it runs cross-platform, on both desktop and laptop computers, as well as on iOS and Android phones and tablets. This is thanks to the fact that it runs in browser using HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, rather than Adobe's proprietary Flash platform. This means that no special plugins are required and, if you have a recent version of a mainstream browser, you should be good to go. \n \nIn Shoot The Rocks the aim of the game is to defend your ship from wave after wave of incoming asteroids and flying saucers. This sounds simple but quickly becomes very challenging, and you'll need to use every trick of fancy flying available to you - plus hyperspace, shield, and flip functions - to stay in the game. \n \nShoot The Rocks combines elements of both the original Asteroids, along with its follow-up, Asteroids Plus, with its own unique spin to create an engaging and addictive game. Two modes of play are offered. Classic mode aims to play as much like the original asteroids as possible, whilst the modern mode offers a slightly different take that should appeal to both fans of the original and newer players.","storyline":"The original Asteroids sees your lone spaceship pitted against endless waves of incoming asteroids and hostile flying saucers determined to blow you into smithereens. Shoot The Rocks is no different, although it does combine elements of the original Asteroids with its successor, Asteroids Deluxe. \n \nThe name of the game here is survival: how long will you last, and how many points can you score before you succumb? This is a game that rewards an attentive eye and quick reactions.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,10039,25311,27314,64204,68287,29525,25300,76229,36950],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435488,268435489,536871078,536871756,536871783,536872530,536872909,536875070,536875939,1073741827],"developers":[12673],"publishers":[12673],"game_engines":[462],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[166,844,871,1618,1997,4158,5027],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,32,33],"first_release_date":1483228800000,"status":3,"platforms":[34,39,82],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1483228800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jan-01","y":2017,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1483228800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jan-01","y":2017,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":82,"date":1483228800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jan-01","y":2017,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Asteroids"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yof9fu2sc2lhpch1cdmx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yof9fu2sc2lhpch1cdmx","width":2182,"height":1422},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dkunzgg4al9ze8wdiz9l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dkunzgg4al9ze8wdiz9l","width":1928,"height":1240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q0lyfvjgfnsaasuzmpny.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q0lyfvjgfnsaasuzmpny","width":1324,"height":1336}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"aWSLVZ1Uth0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pk4gnb0wmycg3umezsqb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pk4gnb0wmycg3umezsqb","width":2234,"height":746},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCIDnkDNZvnQcGD8QRAL-ABA"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/arcade_ly"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/arcadelygames"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/arcade.ly\/games\/asteroids\/"}]}
