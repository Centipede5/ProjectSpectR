See the classic action platformer the way it was meant to be seen, heard, and played... on a PC!\n\nKurt Hectic in his snazzy suit with ribbon chute is back to save the universe. This time he is teamed with the genius Dr. Hawkins and the 6-legged gun-toting robotic dog, Max. Together they must out-sneak, out-blast and out-think their enemies as they attempt to reclaim the Earth from a vile alien menace.\n\nAnd this time they're in HD.\n\nAll three characters - Kurt, Doctor Hawkins and Max are playable, each has his own levels, powers and items and a completely different gameplay focus. Kurt is about stealth and sniping, the Doctor has a few direct attacks but also has the ability to create items and effects out of simple household objects, while Max is a cigar smoking, quad gun toting demolition squad of a dog. Key Features 10 Levels\nOver 20 Enemies\nThree different player characters, Max, Dr Hawkins and Kurt\nUnique levels and items for each character\nBrand new HD graphics\nEnhanced audio from the original sources\nTweaked gameplay - now Easy really is Easy, while Hard is BONE CRUSHING!","rating":50,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"developers":[2501],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1343606400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1343606400000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jul-30","y":2012,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pe8pp3ngljtocdxo9cl6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pe8pp3ngljtocdxo9cl6","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z21urqlnejflz7qllfq4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z21urqlnejflz7qllfq4","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vqhme1jpba91iloout5n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vqhme1jpba91iloout5n","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ak1c27ht1gxjnxkskmy5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ak1c27ht1gxjnxkskmy5","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yt7hedb7q4tbzafcvmc6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yt7hedb7q4tbzafcvmc6","width":1920,"height":1080}],"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.overhaulgames.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/213350"}],"external":{"steam":"213350"}}
