Your general \nobjective is to keep everybody and everything safe from the \nvolcano and the periodical air strikes. And the submarine. \n \nStarting on the left hand side of the playing area, the first \nisland is your base. This is where you start from, and if your \nhelicopter gets damaged, landing here will repair it. You can \nalso refuel from here as well. Should you also rescue any \npeople, this is where you must drop them of to gain the points. \nRescuing is done by lowering the rope and flying the end of it \ninto the men. Depending on how much rope you lower, you can \ncarry up to 5 people at once. When dropping them off, be careful \nthat you just lower the bottom person on the rope to level with \nthe ground - they will automatically climb off. If you go down \ntoo low you will kill them.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76246,19341,28029,32902,24920,272,68287,10039,68142,36608],"tags":[1,268435461],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[5]}
