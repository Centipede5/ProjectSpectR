First you must get through the meadow and across the ledges without losing life and limb. \n \nYou start in a screen called The Mysterious Meadow. You must hop from the top to the river, landing on the turtle while avoiding snakes and choppers that will lose you a life and butterflies that will send you back to start. Do not dally as you are timed and if time runs out, you lose a life. Once you get to the turtle, he will take you to The Land of Ledges. Here you must hop from ledge to ledge and change their color, ala Q*Bert. Beware of the man at the top of the screen, as he will drop stones that will lose you a life. In later levels, he will change some ledges back to their original color, forcing you to retrace your steps. You are still timed so don't delay. After you finish The Land of Ledges, it is off to The Bunny Bushes. This is just a cinematic of you finding a mate and family. You can skip this if you press fire. Then the game starts back at the beginning, but more difficult this time!","collection":3417,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[51485,36794,36608,34919,24199,16468,22819,23175,40524,41828],"tags":[1,268435489,536875088,536875384,1073741826],"developers":[5908],"publishers":[5908],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[4176,4472],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/argbibrad8egyvqzq8wq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"argbibrad8egyvqzq8wq","width":1000,"height":1458}}
