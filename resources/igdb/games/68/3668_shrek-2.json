{"id":3668,"name":"Shrek 2","slug":"shrek-2","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/shrek-2","created_at":1389286238028,"updated_at":1547448944595,"summary":"Game based on the second movie, developed by the makers of Vigilante 8. Shrek is on a journey to meet his in-laws, so Shrek 2 follows his adventure to Far Away Land and the chaos that ensues once Fiona's parents learn that their precious daughter is an ogre -- and is married to the crudest of them all. Shrek 2 features a mixture of puzzle solving and enemy bashing. Players are able to control one of four characters at any given time -- swapping between them at will. Each character has a set of basic attack moves and a special ability. Donkey has a \"Burro Blast\" that can knock down large objects, Shrek can pick up and throw heavy objects, and Fiona -- in a nod to her fight scene in the first movie -- can slow down time, Matrix-style.","collection":3073,"franchise":84,"franchises":[84],"rating":50.2282673974904,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":63.75,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":56.9891336987452,"total_rating_count":25,"rating_count":20,"games":[29032,28070,103312,76747,37419,33269,24426,20342,3977,19150],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536872293,536873334,536874830,536875054,536875074,536875265,536875292,536875294,536876694,536877280,1073741826],"developers":[258,65,72],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":10800,"normally":16200,"completely":18000},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[1381,2422,3918,4142,4162,4353,4380,4382,5782,6368],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":1083542400000,"platforms":[6,14,11,24,21,55,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1087516800000,"human":"2004-Jun-18","y":2004,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1087516800000,"human":"2004-Jun-18","y":2004,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1087516800000,"human":"2004-Jun-18","y":2004,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1087516800000,"human":"2004-Jun-18","y":2004,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1083542400000,"human":"2004-May-03","y":2004,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1085961600000,"human":"2004-May-31","y":2004,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":55,"date":1085961600000,"human":"2004-May-31","y":2004,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Shrek 2: Team Action"}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vu0lZDrkVDo"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ridmpek2yuogwbcxcm9e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ridmpek2yuogwbcxcm9e","width":256,"height":359},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for all persons.","rating":1}}
