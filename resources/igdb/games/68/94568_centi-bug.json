A long slithering alien being gradually moves down a gridded playing area and must be shot out before it can reach the bottom, with the ability to move your ship in all 4 compass directions. Curiously, it doesn't seem to be possible to get a joystick to work in this, despite the chance to define keys.","popularity":1,"games":[87728,99460,100934,76253,104819,18288,15851,103298,91140,99307],"tags":[1,268435489,536874424,1073741827],"developers":[11700],"publishers":[11700],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3512],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":441676800000,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rs1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rs1","width":256,"height":192},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rs0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rs0","width":256,"height":192},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rrz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rrz","width":256,"height":192}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1i9v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1i9v","width":499,"height":794}}
