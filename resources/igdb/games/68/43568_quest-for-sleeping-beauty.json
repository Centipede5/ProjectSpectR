The version with which most modern audiences are familiar is based on a tale published in Germany by the Brothers Grimm in the early 1800s, popularized as a ballet in 1890 and later as a movie by Walt Disney. \nQuest For Sleeping Beauty is not the developer's first foray into the fantastical. Spiral House's past projects include Ghost Master and Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare. \nIn order to ensure an entirely child-friendly game, with a PEGI rating of 3+, the developer has created a \"combat system\" based entirely on immobilizing, scaring or avoiding enemies, with no blood or violence.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
