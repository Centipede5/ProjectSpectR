Exile's game physics engine qualifies it to be the first game to have a complete Newtonian motion model. At the time of its release it was considered to push the boundaries of what was possible on home computers, particularly on the 8-bit platforms. It remains probably the most complex game available for the BBC Micro. The game was designed and programmed by Peter Irvin (author of Starship Command, a space shoot-em-up with an innovative control system) and Jeremy Smith (author of Thrust, a game based on cave exploration with a simpler physics model).","collection":4596,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[113,6958,1128,127,2909,529,9655,359,3025,9927],"tags":[1,17,18,19,21,22,268435464,268435468,268435487,268435489,536870934,536870947,536870962,536870984,536870990,536871049,536871063,536871082,536871133,536871134,536871138,536871139,536871213,536871219,536871301,536871389,536871470,536871487,536871506,536871599,536871738,536871859,536871865,536871882,536871938,536871945,536871971,536872010,536872014,536872032,536872352,536872371,536872425,536872451,536872626,536872862,536872873,536872898,536872956,536872961,536873016,536873066,536873674,536873863,536873947,536874653,536874706,536874743,536875067,536875073,536875099,536875106,536875161,536875196,536875199,536875214,536875258,536875276,536875300,536875303,536875358,536875362,536875372,536875400,536875403,536875420,536875440,536875449,536875455,536875472,536875523,536875524,536875525,536875527,536875528,536875536,536875622,536875699,536875775,536875810,536875822,536875830,536875837,536875880,536875896,536875942,536876007,536876054,536876201,536876219,536876232,536876233,536876330,536876384,536876388,536876437,536876490,536876505,536876522,536876563,536876642,536876687,536876730,536877238,536877302,536877384,536877394,536877451,536877453,536877648,536878007,536878009,536878366,536878502,536878538,536878562,536879064,536879123,536879192,536879196,536880094,536880158,536880224,536880261,536880266,536880430,536880734,536880742,536880761,536881467,536882225,536884871,1073741828],"developers":[1292],"publishers":[1292],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[22,35,50,72,78,137,151,170,221,222,226,227,301,307,389,477,558,575,594,687,826,947,953,970,1026,1033,1059,1098,1102,1120,1440,1459,1513,1539,1714,1950,1961,1986,2044,2049,2104,2154,2762,2951,3035,3741,3794,3831,4155,4161,4187,4194,4249,4284,4287,4302,4346,4364,4388,4391,4446,4450,4460,4488,4491,4508,4528,4537,4543,4560,4611,4612,4613,4615,4616,4624,4710,4787,4863,4898,4910,4918,4925,4968,4984,5030,5095,5142,5289,5307,5320,5321,5418,5472,5476,5525,5578,5593,5610,5651,5730,5775,5818,6326,6390,6472,6482,6539,6541,6736,7095,7097,7454,7590,7626,7650,8152,8211,8280,8284,9182,9246,9312,9349,9354,9518,9822,9830,9849,10555,11313,13959],"themes":[1,17,18,19,21,22],"genres":[8,12,31,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[63,69,114,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":69,"date":599529600000,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":63,"human":"TBD"},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Exile: Toki no Hazama e","comment":"Other"},{"name":"XZR 2","comment":"Other"},{"name":"XZR II","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/syoho0k5hbcdqt81djng.jpg","cloudinary_id":"syoho0k5hbcdqt81djng","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r9v3qvybppccxcynow7h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r9v3qvybppccxcynow7h","width":640,"height":758}}
