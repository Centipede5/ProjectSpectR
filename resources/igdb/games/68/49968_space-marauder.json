Rather than sending out a fleet of space destroyers or loads of nuclear warheads, it is determined that Earth's best chance of wiping out these creatures is (drum roll, please) you! As Space Marauder, it is your job to avoid waves of space beings careening through the outer reaches of the galaxy. You are aiding only by a jet pack and a laser gun. Sound tough? It is. Assorted power-ups are strewn about to help you in your plight, but the best asset you'll have is your itchy trigger finger and taste for alien blood. Lots of powerful bosses wait at the end of each of the game's levels, and every stage presents new and increasingly difficult challenges for our hero. Boasting a cool soundtrack and smooth controls, there's plenty of gameplay to keep your fingers moving for hours on end.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":970099200000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":970099200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Sep-28","y":2000,"m":9}]}
