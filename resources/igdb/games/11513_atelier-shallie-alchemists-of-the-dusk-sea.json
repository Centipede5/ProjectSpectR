As part of the \"Atelier\" series of games, it is the third and final installment of the \"Dusk\" storyline. The game's story takes place about 10 years after the beginning of Atelier Ayesha: The Alchemist of Dusk and 6 years after the beginning of Atelier Escha & Logy: Alchemists of the Dusk Sky. The player is able to choose to play as one of two characters, each with a differing storyline and adventure; regardless of which character is chosen, the flow of the game remains the same. In comparison to previous Atelier games, fields are significantly larger, and the player is able to harvest a wider variety of items and raw materials to use for mixing.","collection":2501,"franchise":900,"franchises":[900],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":76.75,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":76.75,"total_rating_count":5,"games":[25921,55092,26765,13623,12511,18398,22387,27209,68441,28168],"tags":[17,268435468,536870990,536871139,536871208,536871422,536871433,536871938,536872010,536872211,536873302,536873311,536873580,536874398,536875157,536875556,536875792,536876286,536876712,536877510,536878078,536879734,536881376,536888127,1073741826],"developers":[3046],"publishers":[3046,6066,7445],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,227,296,510,521,1026,1098,1299,2390,2399,2668,3486,4245,4644,4880,5374,5800,6598,7166,8822,10464,17215],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1403740800000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1403740800000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Jun-26","y":2014,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1425945600000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Mar-10","y":2015,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1426204800000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Mar-13","y":2015,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30b7\u30e3\u30ea\u30fc\u306e\u30a2\u30c8\u30ea\u30a8\uff5e\u9ec4\u660f\u306e\u6d77\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u58eb\uff5e","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aluy17pgpwodrplt0nd9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aluy17pgpwodrplt0nd9","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vy8jq0hzpcz5hqe0dupx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vy8jq0hzpcz5hqe0dupx","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hsbfnesrrynwzbtyhp2h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hsbfnesrrynwzbtyhp2h","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p4ihwjunts3dkbs7vzdw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p4ihwjunts3dkbs7vzdw","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rkow9vzdpcyvymhprsoy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rkow9vzdpcyvymhprsoy","width":966,"height":300}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"LKfpYAWBGNQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fxks4iitbxbdtfy0un7i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fxks4iitbxbdtfy0un7i","width":1310,"height":1500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a role-playing game in which players assume the roles of Shallistera and Shallotte, two alchemists trying to solve problems in their respective towns.

Characters are briefly shown striking fantastical monsters (e.g., dragons, giant insects) with weapons, magic attacks, or explosive items. Damage is indicated by hit points, and characters occasionally crying out in pain. Female characters are sometimes depicted in swimsuits or outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage. One mission requires players to create pipe tobacco for a male character; the character is then shown smoking and commenting on the taste of the tobacco. The word \u201cdamn\u201d appears in the dialogue.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/atelier-ps3.jp\/shallie\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atelier_Shallie:_Alchemists_of_the_Dusk_Sea"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/atelier.wikia.com\/wiki\/Atelier_Shallie:_Alchemists_of_the_Dusk_Sea"}]}
