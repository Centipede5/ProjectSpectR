As they progress through the story, players engage in turn-based battles against robots, droids, and occasionally human enemies. Characters use pistols, machine guns, shotguns, swords, and psychic abilities (e.g., pyrokinesis, telekinesis) to deplete enemies' hit points. Robots and droids explode when defeated; human characters cry out in pain and collapse when defeated. Splashes of blood occasionally appear when sword-wielding characters flick their blades after a slashing attack. A handful of scenes contain suggestive dialogue: \u201cI've no intention of accepting your friendliness tinged in sexual desire\u201d; \u201c[I] wouldn't know in terms of physical pleasure. I've never had sex before;\u201d \u201c[I]'m sure the chance to debut is higher with a cute face and big boobs.\u201d The word \u201csh*t\u201d appears in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - ","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/626600"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lost_Dimension"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/lost-dimension.wikia.com\/wiki\/Lost_Dimension_Wikia"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.atlus.com\/lostdimension\/"}],"external":{"steam":"626600"}}
