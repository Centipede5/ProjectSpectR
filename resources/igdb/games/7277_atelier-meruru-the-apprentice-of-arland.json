It is the third and final game in the Arland series and a direct sequel to Atelier Totori: The Adventurer of Arland. The game features a turn-based battle system. Battles are based on the idea that the princess, Meruru, is the leader and those accompanying her are considered \"escorts.\" Meruru can use items in battle and depending on the conditions in battle, her escorts can chain attacks and the power of the items can be increased.","storyline":"Meruru is the princess of Arls, a little kingdom situated in the far north of the Arland republic. After her father and Gio, the leader of Arland, discussed the merging of the two lands, she met Totori, the now-graduated alchemist. Dazzled by the power of alchemy, and with a desire to help her country prosper, she forced herself on Totori as her first student. Her father initially disapproves of this decision, but agrees following a suggestion from Rufus. He gives Meruru a directive to use her alchemy to improve the kingdom, with several intermediate goals which must be met within specific time periods in order to be allowed to continue her alchemy work. Later, Rorona joins the two, but she has been turned into a child by Astrid after drinking an experimental potion of youth.","collection":2520,"franchise":900,"franchises":[900],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":90,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":90,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[25921,12632,36534,11214,13558,47158,11667,27209,13623,55092],"tags":[17,268435468,536870990,536871208,536871422,536871433,536871938,536872121,536873302,536873311,536873580,536875556,536876240,1073741826],"developers":[3046],"publishers":[3046,2262,7445,6066],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,296,510,521,1026,1209,2390,2399,2668,4644,5328],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1308787200000,"platforms":[46,9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1337904000000,"region":1,"human":"2012-May-25","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1338249600000,"region":2,"human":"2012-May-29","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1308787200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Jun-23","y":2011,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1338422400000,"region":3,"human":"2012-May-31","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1363737600000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Mar-20","y":2013,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1378166400000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Sep-03","y":2013,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1378252800000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Sep-04","y":2013,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30e1\u30eb\u30eb\u306e\u30a2\u30c8\u30ea\u30a8\uff5e\u30a2\u30fc\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u306e\u932c\u91d1\u8853\u58eb3","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Atelier Meruru: The Alchemist of Arland 3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ee0c6ijdjc8gfpvzgti1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ee0c6ijdjc8gfpvzgti1","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wq1t5lsu3x4hxrnhcb1v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wq1t5lsu3x4hxrnhcb1v","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oxrx89acphco7h36ek8b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oxrx89acphco7h36ek8b","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/njboaycgcg5tcdz1bgig.jpg","cloudinary_id":"njboaycgcg5tcdz1bgig","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jmdoz47lzbzvjtymskmx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jmdoz47lzbzvjtymskmx","width":670,"height":377}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oxk7iocqfmkkp2jwyypv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oxk7iocqfmkkp2jwyypv","width":850,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s53ypntbtq5vs5oofpp9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s53ypntbtq5vs5oofpp9","width":730,"height":1030},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sx3wqmcdvziodcb9dtyn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sx3wqmcdvziodcb9dtyn","width":600,"height":850},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cn1atvof5nfocp8q9ou6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cn1atvof5nfocp8q9ou6","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/brirxsxxvmdiowcc95s6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"brirxsxxvmdiowcc95s6","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vaelacsmcpwvlgtrodqj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vaelacsmcpwvlgtrodqj","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b8rog0yugdacubbooa3i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b8rog0yugdacubbooa3i","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jdllcxzwh4qm0forjhgr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jdllcxzwh4qm0forjhgr","width":1000,"height":630},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wocvypgmpg6l3knve36p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wocvypgmpg6l3knve36p","width":1000,"height":630}],"videos":[{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"LDjngttYkas"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Wb5O_xvUHm4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wjpohl4qzmve5esab4pz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wjpohl4qzmve5esab4pz","width":250,"height":290},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of Meruru, a young princess preparing to merge her kingdom with a larger republic. As players explore landscapes and collect treasure, they use staffs, swords, and magic attacks to battle human enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., lizard men, griffons, dragons). Players select attacks\/spells from a menu screen and watch characters engage in turn-based combat. Enemies usually blink and disappear when defeated. A few sequences include drunken characters with flushed faces and slurred speech (e.g., \u201cIt seems he's quite intoxicated. He's been drinking at a furious pace,\u201d \u201cI am not drunk. Absolutely,\u201d \u201cThat's what everyone says when they're drunk.\u201d). Some dialogue includes discussion of characters' breast sizes (e.g., \u201cWhy don't we see who's been . . . developing?\u201d and \u201cThat coy response, this supple texture . . . you get an A+!\u201d); one still-frame cutscene depicts a drunken woman making unwanted advances toward another female character (e.g., \u201cWhy are you acting like some creepy drunk guy!? Stoooop!\u201d \u201c[C]'mon, lemme have a little squeeze.\u201d). A hot springs sequence also depicts women's breasts\/buttocks that are partially obscured by mist, bubbles, and towels. The word \u201cdamn\u201d can be heard in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Sexual images and\/or sexual innuendo - Mild bad language","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/nisamerica.com\/games\/atelier-meruru\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atelier_Meruru:_The_Apprentice_of_Arland"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/atelier.wikia.com\/wiki\/Atelier_Meruru:_The_Apprentice_of_Arland"}]}
