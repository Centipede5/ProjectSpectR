As a tiny tentacled organism, you have one simple purpose: to grow. Swim through the primordial ooze, using your tentacles to absorb other organisms whose colour matches that of each tentacle. Match the colours correctly and the tentacle grows; mismatch and you lose a life \u2013 and some of your tentacle. Control your organism by simply spinning your way through the ooze; however keep a close eye on your flailing tentacles to avoid absorbing the wrong colour of organisms around you. Enjoy three different modes of play, and relaxing yet challenging gameplay with simple Wii Remote controls (or use the optional Classic Controller). It's a microscopic masterpiece!","collection":2726,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":86,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":86,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[60044,25222,25646,14047,20329,72143,60906,40100,36608,26223],"tags":[1,268435465,536872407,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[1495,2875],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1467072000000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1467072000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Jun-28","y":2016,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/op37djgufjbgekzcpzgg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"op37djgufjbgekzcpzgg","width":809,"height":960},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
