The player moves around a dungeon, issuing commands by means of typing \u2014 for example, typing \"GET LEFT SHIELD\" or \"USE RIGHT TORCH\" (or abbreviations such as \"G L SH\" and \"U R T\"), gathering strength and ever more powerful weapons as the game progresses. Various creatures appear, and can often be heard when they are nearby, even when not visible. The object of the game is to defeat the second of two wizards, who is on the fifth and last level of the dungeon.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36926,19333,47823,26766,25300,12632,36950,27209,36534,55092],"tags":[1,268435487,536871139,536871208,536871938,536873066,536875242,536875760,536876237],"category":0,"keywords":[227,296,1026,2154,4330,4848,5325],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":381715200000,"platforms":[126],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":126,"date":381715200000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Feb-05","y":1982,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xczvu2zdmkreoxh9nuvb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xczvu2zdmkreoxh9nuvb","width":448,"height":448}}
