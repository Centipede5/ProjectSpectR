Each level takes place on a single game screen, and you must get to the yellow doorman to continue to the next level. Note the signs; they hold words of truth and wisdom. They're also Chatty Cathys, so you could just ignore them if you wanted. \n \nYou play Maxalena, a warrior looking for a precious hidden jewel that is said to have been altered with a lost advanced technology from a race long extinct. The gem allows its user to displace themselves to another position instantly. \n \nBasically, the gem can teleport you after being thrown on the ground. You have to use that to traverse the different puzzles in the game world. Pretty simple.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1425859200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1425859200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Mar-09","y":2015,"m":3}]}
