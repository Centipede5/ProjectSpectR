In it, the player has a choice of six different Wacky Worlds in which they can place animated \"stickers\", creating a two-dimensional diorama, of sorts. Among the Worlds are an underwater scene, a scene inside a house, a jungle, and the Moon. This game is considered a Sonic the Hedgehog property, as he appears on the cover of the box. Sonic also pilots the flying saucer that is used to choose a Wacky World to play in. He also appears in a small portrait sticker for the default sticker book in the house scene. Miles \"Tails\" Prower and Ecco the Dolphin appear on the box of the game as well. This game was made to compete with Nintendo's Mario Paint.","franchise":1058,"franchises":[1058,814],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[44242,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,55590,55689,24436,22406],"tags":[34,268435469,536870928,536870992,536871446,536872060,536872638,536875232,536877141,536880542,536886756],"developers":[691],"category":0,"keywords":[16,80,534,1148,1726,4320,6229,9630,15844],"themes":[34],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[29,6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":14,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":760060800000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r6sxvha2n9wthn6jim2c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r6sxvha2n9wthn6jim2c","width":200,"height":278},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/sonic.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wacky_Worlds_Creativity_Studio"}]}
