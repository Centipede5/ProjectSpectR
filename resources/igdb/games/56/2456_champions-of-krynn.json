Rampaging through the lands surrounding the cities which are still used as bases of power by the forces of Evil, the characters will uncover a plot by the Aurak Draconian Myrtani to lure the good armies into a trap and wipe them out.","storyline":"The War of the Lance is over, but Evil is a BAD loser... With the Dragonarmies defeated and the lands to the east reconquered, the forces of good have withdrawn and settled down to a well-earned rest. Evil forces, however, never rest and have been quietly plotting a cataclysmic return to power! Their goal: nothing short of establishing the Dark Queen, Takhisis, as undisputed ruler of Krynn! Guide your party of characters through a dark web of intrigue and combat, where dragons, draconians and other unspeakable monstrosities dwell. Go with a brave heart - for you and your heroic adventurers are all that stand in the way of evil tyranny.","collection":483,"franchise":43,"franchises":[43],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1593,26766,23198,12041,6,18822,11214,12632,1907,36534],"tags":[17,268435468,536871059,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871237,536871254,536871504,536871648,536871938,536872425,536872978,536873066,536875042,536875075,536875160,536875161,536875184,536875196,536875265,536875304,536875306,536875311,536875361,536875380,536875455,536875738,536875791,536876301,536876706,536878072,536878358,536878375,536878494,536879070,536879693,536880562,536884533,536884867,536886005,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[528],"publishers":[3491,528],"game_engines":[165],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[147,226,227,296,325,342,592,736,1026,1513,2066,2154,4130,4163,4248,4249,4272,4284,4353,4392,4394,4399,4449,4468,4543,4826,4879,5389,5794,7160,7446,7463,7582,8158,8781,9650,13621,13955,15093],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[14,13,16,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1445904000000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-27","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1445904000000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-27","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wzqqlmmg0tq6tqtgykhy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wzqqlmmg0tq6tqtgykhy","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lhft2empgavzvbhx3yx5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lhft2empgavzvbhx3yx5","width":640,"height":965},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Champions_of_Krynn"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/gaming.wikia.com\/wiki\/Champions_of_Krynn"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.gog.com\/game\/dungeons_dragons_krynn_series"}]}
