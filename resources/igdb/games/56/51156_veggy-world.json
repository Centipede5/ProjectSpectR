Fire lasers and blue pellets at a steady wave of fruit and vegetable creatures, causing the personified food to explode in a bright burst. The depiction is mostly whimsical, though you do see their \"kill percentage\" tallied on menu screens at the end of each round. Game customized for each target platform.","popularity":1,"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1276819200000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1276819200000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Jun-18","y":2010,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vkcxfnewvbxonpfxdmkm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vkcxfnewvbxonpfxdmkm","width":1000,"height":1399}}
