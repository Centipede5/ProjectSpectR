When a player gets hit enough times to lose all their hit points, they are defeated. \n \nThe game features a Story Mode, which pits the player against a series of nine opponents that get progressively harder, and a versus mode, which is a single match against either an AI opponent or a human opponent(or, two AI opponents). With the netplay patch, multiplayer is also possible through LAN or over the Internet.","storyline":"PROLOGUE \nSpring has come once again in Gensokyo, and instead of the usual flowers blooming, flowers from every season are coming up at the same time. The heroines realize something ood is going on when they see this thick layer of flowers covering much of Gensokyo, and soon head out in search of answers, whether out of curiosity, duty, or boredom. \n \nGENERAL STORY \nStarting off somewhere near the Misty Lake next to the Scarlet Devil Mansion, the heroines set out and soon encounter the other characters. Battling them in succession, they eventually reach those who have the answers, Komachi Onozuka and Shikieiki Yamaxanadu.","collection":2093,"franchise":780,"franchises":[780],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27209,23733,22387,47823,68441,18869,45966,27162,27167,55092],"tags":[1,17,268435461,536870990,536871029,536871078,536871138,536871208,536871823,536872225,536873476,536874259,536874398,536875158,536875941,536876634,536878105,536879840,536881910,536881911,536881912,1073741827],"publishers":[12117],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[78,117,166,226,296,911,1313,2564,3347,3486,4246,5029,5722,7193,8928,10998,10999,11000],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1123977600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1123977600000,"region":5,"human":"2005-Aug-14","y":2005,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Touhou Kaeizuka\nTouhou 9","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Touhou Kaeitzuka - Phantasmagoria of Flower View","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"PoFV","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Th09","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hzaaymo3msyzbt11hi2n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hzaaymo3msyzbt11hi2n","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"hC27S5Xunxw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oejacufs88favuzagbok.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oejacufs88favuzagbok","width":250,"height":249},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/touhou.wikia.com\/wiki\/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www16.big.or.jp\/~zun\/html\/th09top.html"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.touhouwiki.net\/wiki\/Phantasmagoria_of_Flower_View"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2}]}
