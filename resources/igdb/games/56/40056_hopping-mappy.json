The rounds do not get any more confusing because the cats move in preset patterns - and the main strategy that is used to get past them, is comprised of a difficult way to more or less stand still. There are a total of thirty-one distinct rounds that the player can continue through even if he runs out of lives","collection":3225,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28154,19174,55752,18927,36868,76723,56543,56364,56338,63138],"tags":[268435464,536872961,536872983,536873064,536875046,536875434,536877330,536879184],"category":0,"keywords":[2049,2071,2152,4134,4522,6418,8272],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":512697600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":512697600000,"region":8,"human":"1986-Apr-01","y":1986,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xgj9opxsgjnzdbtmn0rx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xgj9opxsgjnzdbtmn0rx","width":400,"height":560}}
