The cartridge was the final release in the series of Mega Games compilations, and contains 6 of Sega's most successful games from the early days of the Genesis. It is the only volume of the Mega Games 6 series to introduce a new game to the Mega Games range, and the only Mega Games release to use the shortened Mega 6 title. The game came with individual instruction manuals for each game rather than integrating them all into a single manual. This compilation utilises the standard game selection screen seen in previous Sega compilation releases, including the Mega Games series, Classic Collection and Sonic Classics.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":820368000000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xpjbrdns7nt3rls1btdy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xpjbrdns7nt3rls1btdy","width":1344,"height":1882}}
