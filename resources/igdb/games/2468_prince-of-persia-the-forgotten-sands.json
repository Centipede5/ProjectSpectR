When the Prince arrives at Malik's kingdom, he finds it under attack by an army who are attempting to breach the treasure vaults for a great power known as \"Solomon's Army\". The Prince charges in to the city, and tracks Malik to the treasure vaults. Here, Malik says that he is fighting a losing battle and proposes to rely on a last resort or be forced to retreat. The Prince strongly objects, but Malik releases Solomon's Army using a magical seal. Solomon's Army is an assortment of different creatures, all made of sand. The Prince and Malik both manage to obtain halves of the seal used to keep the army contained, protecting them from being turned into sand statues, which is the fate of the rest of the kingdom.","collection":187,"franchise":495,"franchises":[495],"rating":67.5917157398228,"popularity":4.666666666666666,"aggregated_rating":80.8,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":74.1958578699114,"total_rating_count":93,"rating_count":87,"games":[837,2437,836,127,3025,6958,7346,26855,128,499],"tags":[1,17,22,268435464,268435481,268435487,536871082,536871088,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871247,536871302,536871738,536871865,536871945,536872010,536872205,536872232,536872352,536872983,536873053,536873067,536873192,536873455,536873674,536874190,536874209,536875046,536875047,536875050,536875052,536875067,536875073,536875081,536875090,536875157,536875178,536875257,536875259,536875271,536875301,536875437,536875453,536875455,536875492,536875645,536875701,536875744,536875760,536875778,536875792,536875802,536875805,536875808,536875830,536875840,536875912,536876031,536876069,536876220,536876315,536876377,536876476,536876569,536876606,536876695,536876704,536876711,536876726,536876735,536876751,536876762,536876813,536876816,536876821,536876852,536876934,536876952,536877161,536877164,536877275,536877294,536877405,536877571,536877576,536877586,536877658,536878132,536878147,536878264,536878281,536878523,536878600,536879092,536879798,536879895,536879992,536880112,536880274,536881080,536882386,536882448,536883308,536883320,536883322,536883660,536883898,536883899,536892278,536892279,1073741826],"developers":[822,898,38,896],"publishers":[104],"game_engines":[9,76],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[170,176,227,296,301,335,390,826,953,1033,1098,1293,1320,1440,2071,2141,2155,2280,2543,2762,3278,3297,4134,4135,4138,4140,4155,4161,4169,4178,4245,4266,4345,4347,4359,4389,4525,4541,4543,4580,4733,4789,4832,4848,4866,4880,4890,4893,4896,4918,4928,5000,5119,5157,5308,5403,5465,5564,5657,5694,5783,5792,5799,5814,5823,5839,5850,5901,5904,5909,5940,6022,6040,6249,6252,6363,6382,6493,6659,6664,6674,6746,7220,7235,7352,7369,7611,7688,8180,8886,8983,9080,9200,9362,10168,11474,11536,12396,12408,12410,12748,12986,12987,21366,21367],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[8,25,31],"first_release_date":1273708800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,92,9,38,12,20,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1273708800000,"region":1,"human":"2010-May-13","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1274140800000,"region":2,"human":"2010-May-18","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1276128000000,"human":"2010-Jun-10","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1276300800000,"human":"2010-Jun-12","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1274140800000,"human":"2010-May-18","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1274140800000,"human":"2010-May-18","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1274140800000,"human":"2010-May-18","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1274140800000,"human":"2010-May-18","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1274140800000,"human":"2010-May-18","y":2010,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"POPTFS","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"POP:

action game in which players assume the role of a prince on a quest to stop and seal a magical army made from the desert's sand. Players employ the prince's acrobatic skills and magical abilities (e.g., freezing water and rewinding time) to solve puzzles, traverse landscapes, and kill an assortment of fantasy creatures. The combat is frenetic as players frequently engage in close-up sword battle: stabbing attacks, screams of pain, fast-paced melee combat with multiple enemies. Cutscenes also depict soldiers punching, kicking, and slashing each other on the battlefield.","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Prince_of_Persia:_The_Forgotten_Sands"},{"category":2,"url":"https:\/\/princeofpersia.fandom.com\/wiki\/Prince_of_Persia:_The_Forgotten_Sands"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.princeofpersiagame.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/33320"}],"external":{"steam":"33320"}}
