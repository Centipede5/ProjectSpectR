This campaign comes as part of Total War\u2122: ROME II \u2013 Emperor Edition and is available as a free, automatic update to existing owners of Total War\u2122: ROME II.\nThe Imperator Augustus Campaign Pack is set in 42 BC during the chaotic aftermath of Caesar\u2019s grisly murder. The republic remains whole, but its soul is divided as three great men, the members of the Second Triumvirate, hold the future of Rome in the palms of their hands. \n\nOctavian, Caesar\u2019s adoptive son and the heir to his legacy.\n\nMarc Antony, Caesar\u2019s loyal friend and most trusted lieutenant.\n\nLepidus, Pontifex Maximus of Rome and the man who secured Caesar\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nWith the territories of The Republic divided between them and the military might of Rome at their beck-and-call, the members of The Second Triumvirate are each in a position to make a bid for leadership, and rule Rome as its first \u2013 and only \u2013 emperor. \n\nHowever, external forces are on the move, looking to exploit the instability of Rome and expand their own territories. Will you fight as a defender of Rome and defeat the other members of the Triumvirate? Or lead another faction on a campaign of conquest and expansion, and take advantage of the chaos as the Roman civil war rages?\n\nPlayable Factions\n\nPlayers may embark on a new Campaign as one of the following playable factions:\nMarc Antony\nLepidus\nOctavian\nPompey\nIceni\nMarcomanni\nDacia\nEgypt\nParthia\nArmenia (also now playable in the ROME II Grand Campaign).\n\nHow far will you go for Rome?\n\nThe award-winning Total War series returns to Rome, setting a brand new quality benchmark for Strategy gaming.
