As players traverse around a city, they can identify and interact with ghost-like creatures (Yo-Kai) and use them in turn-based combat against other creatures. Yo-Kai can use various attacks (e.g., punches, sword slashes, magic spells) to drain opponents' life meters; colorful light effects, smacking\/zapping sounds, and depleting hit points indicate damage during battles. A handful of sequences also depict violent acts: a cat hit by a truck; a child beaten up by bullies. The game includes several depictions and references to bodily functions: a Yo-Kai called Snotsolong with mucous dripping from its nose; Yo-Kai (Cuttincheez and Cheeksqueek) with buttocks for heads that use flatulence-like attacks; dialogue that states, \u201cIt smells a little like my farts. . .\u201d and \u201cI mean, if it were my farts that had made this smoke. . . You'd have been knocked out!\u201d","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yo-kai_Watch_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/yokaiwatch.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yo-kai_Watch_2"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/yo-kai.nintendo.com\/yw2\/"}]}
