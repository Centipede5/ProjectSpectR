Duenan and Bri join the Olympus' police, a force that seems hardly necessary in such a paradise. But, like in most pretty pictures, perfection is an illusion, and Olympus' peaceful facade hides a dark secret, a violent struggle between human and cyborg that could once again plunge the world into war... and genocide.","collection":4097,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,142,25300,71455,51464,10724],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870990,536871015,536871882,536871937,536872009,536872581,536875053,536875222],"category":0,"keywords":[78,103,970,1025,1097,1669,4141,4310],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":777859200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":777859200000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Aug-26","y":1994,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":780537600000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Sep-26","y":1994,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gwycjbx5nymszbbehix5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gwycjbx5nymszbbehix5","width":212,"height":380}}
