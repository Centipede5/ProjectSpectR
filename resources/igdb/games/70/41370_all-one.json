All One is a block-pushing puzzle game in which every die must have their \"one\" side facing upwards. \n \nAll One, or Famimaga Disk Vol. 3 All One, is a puzzle game in which the player controls a ladybug pushing over dice. The goal of each stage is to push all the dice onto their side so that their \"one\" side is facing upwards. The player is given a smaller first-person view window from the ladybug's perspective to allow them to see the sides of each die and plan out their strategy. \n \nAs with other block-pushing puzzle games, the game becomes similar to Sokoban or Adventures of Lolo in its complexity as it progresses: there is often only a few (or just one) paths to successfully solving a stage and the player will need to restart if they make a mistake.","collection":3320,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[34823,13200,13660,25311,17686,17130,55038,33726,11582,8714],"tags":[1,18,268435465,268435471,536870999,536871078,536871082,536871882,536872843,536873787,536874694,536875054,536875292,536875358,536876011,536877024,536877440],"category":0,"keywords":[87,166,170,970,1931,2875,3782,4142,4380,4446,5099,6112,6528],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":667180800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":667180800000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Feb-22","y":1991,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":669600000000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Mar-22","y":1991,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/evv1humlv9ndyc1lue5z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"evv1humlv9ndyc1lue5z","width":256,"height":224}}
