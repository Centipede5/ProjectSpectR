The young boy in your family likes to target you for his mischief. He sets up volleys of tennis balls and lets loose a vacuum cleaner on you which you must avoid. The cat and other obstacles await you in your house while you collect bones for power. \n \nAfter all the trouble you cause in the home, you are sent to Obedience School and you have to run a gauntlet of gung-ho instructors and ferocious Dobermans in the heavily-guarded compound. If successful at escaping, you reach a forest filled with wild animals. \n \nYou can use flips, spins and barks to make your way through the various obstacles. A special ball when found will trigger a bonus game that will also teach you how to fetch.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,35371,22425,27092,25311,65832,26145,55590,54996,19934],"tags":[1,27,268435464,268435466,268435469,268435471,268435487,536871262,536871939,536872060,536872847,536872961,536874694,536875053,536875054,536875069,536875088],"category":0,"keywords":[350,1027,1148,1935,2049,3782,4141,4142,4157,4176],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[8,10,13,15,31],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g0gbcfppkkq7yj6ofyt1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g0gbcfppkkq7yj6ofyt1","width":475,"height":347}}
