It was allegedly discovered by a prospector named Jacob Waltz, an old German immigrant who wandered the Superstitions during the early 1880's. He claimed the mine was so rich that the gold could be removed with only a knife.\n\nWaltz died on October 25, 1891, but he left behind many clues as to the location of his fabulous mine. One clue was to look for a pointed peek. Many people believe this peak is the landmark known today as Weaver's Needle. He also claimed his mine was located where no miner would ever look. Many old maps have A surfaced purporting to show the location of Waltz's treasure, but none have proven genuine.\n\nToday the Superstition Mountains continue to draw those who seek the fabled wealth of the King of precious metals. And Weaver's Needle still stands guard over Jacob Waltz's tantalizing secret... the Lost Dutchman Mine.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,22425,18623,26145,41895,44242,21793,29730,19290,27266],"tags":[22,268435465,268435469,268435487,536870921,536871939,536872060,536872850,536873787,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[9,1027,1148,1938,2875],"themes":[22],"genres":[9,13,31],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jokwda3rkgm1nd5jiz2u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jokwda3rkgm1nd5jiz2u","width":620,"height":805}}
