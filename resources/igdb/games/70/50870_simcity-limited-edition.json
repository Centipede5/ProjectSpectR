Released for Microsoft Windows in early March 2013, it's the first major installment in the SimCity series since the release of SimCity 4 a decade prior. An OS X version is scheduled for release during Q1\/Q2 2013. \n \nThe game is considered to be a reboot of the SimCity series.Players can create a settlement that can grow into a city by zoning land for commercial, industrial, or residential development, as well as building and maintaining public services, transport and utilities. SimCity utilizes a new engine called GlassBox, allowing for more detailed simulation than previous games. Throughout its development, SimCity received critical acclaim for its new engine and reimagined gameplay; however, publications cautioned the game's use of a persistent internet connection, with which it stores saved games and allows players to share resources.","collection":90,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"version_parent":1274,"version_title":"Limited Edition","games":[33603,36962,55888,65827,32283,18623,65829,55308,16125,29173],"tags":[28,33,268435469,268435471],"category":0,"themes":[28,33],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":1365120000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1365120000000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Apr-05","y":2013,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ob0ohy6z3em6w0ligd2c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ob0ohy6z3em6w0ligd2c","width":746,"height":1072},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
