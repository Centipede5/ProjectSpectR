The character will die if you touch them.  \n  \nHere is the link to the game : https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.heethpjain.heeth.flappygravity  \n  \nHope so you like my game!  \nPlease leave an honest rating!  \nI won't ask anyone for fake ratings!  \n  \nAnd suggestions are highly appreciated!","popularity":1,"games":[51485,36794,36608,34919,24199,16468,22819,23175,40524,41828],"tags":[1,268435489,536871049,536873605,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[137,2693],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":1488499200000,"platforms":[34],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1488499200000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Mar-03","y":2017,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kqre672fuqyauxnvx3ku.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kqre672fuqyauxnvx3ku","width":1080,"height":1920}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pwutygwkafieuccd85fj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pwutygwkafieuccd85fj","width":1024,"height":500},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
