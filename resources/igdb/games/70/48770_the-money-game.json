It was developed by SOFEL for the NES and released in Japan only. \n \nThe Money Game is a stock market simulation game where the goal is to raise money through the wise purchasing and selling of various types of stock. Coupled to this is a life-sim aspect where raising a sufficient amount of money at certain checkpoints allows the player to gain and keep a girlfriend, who later becomes their wife and provides children. As well, the player can upgrade from their initial studio apartment to a terraced house to a mansion with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool. \n \nThe game is densely packed with Japanese script and requires both literacy in that language and a fairly good understanding of dealing in the stock market itself (though the game does provide tutorials for the latter). It would be followed by a sequel, The Money Game 2: Kabutochou no Kiseki, which in turn would be the basis for SOFEL's Wall Street Kid.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[29173,55689,55590,18623,9199,44242,33603,11419,19847,36962],"tags":[268435469,268435471,536871758,536871906,536872060,536875356,536876991],"category":0,"keywords":[846,994,1148,4444,6079],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":587174400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":587174400000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Aug-10","y":1988,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":589852800000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Sep-10","y":1988,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xckdf9ruahnnp5spm5jg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xckdf9ruahnnp5spm5jg","width":168,"height":244}}
