You play Aaron Boone, the main character from both the book and the movie. Boone is attempting to get to a planet of bliss called Midian. His attempts at gaining acceptable go wrong when he is bitten by a cannibal, and the Police of Earth find Midian and set out to destroy it. Boone must stop them. \n \nThe game has several different sequences, most arcade based, trying to bring sequences from the movie to life on the computer screen.
