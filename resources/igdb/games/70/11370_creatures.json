You exist in this world only as a virtual presence, a sort of remote-control existence, which the computer portrays as a hand-shaped mouse cursor. In this world are a range of locations and strange creatures, related loosely (and with considerable poetic license) to Northern myth. You begin near to the long-abandoned home of a family of Norns (small furry creatures), where a few eggs, languishing in a broken-down incubator, are almost all that remains of the Nornir race.","collection":1526,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[44242,11679,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,11372,55590,55689],"tags":[268435469,536870984,536872060,536872352,536872626,536873096,536875531,536875809,536876571,536876629,536876718,536878505,536882216,536884831],"category":0,"keywords":[72,1148,1440,1714,2184,4619,4897,5659,5717,5806,7593,11304,13919],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":846806400000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":13,"date":846806400000,"human":"1996-Nov","y":1996,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bwo8wdjerxqvurwrwbwx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bwo8wdjerxqvurwrwbwx","width":800,"height":922}}
