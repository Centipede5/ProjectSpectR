{"id":29270,"name":"Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate","slug":"warhammer-40000-chaos-gate","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/warhammer-40000-chaos-gate","created_at":1495293673579,"updated_at":1527707707982,"summary":"Set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Chaos Gate tells the story of an Ultramarines army led by Captain Kruger, as he attempts to recover the Concordat Chaosium, a pre-Horus heresy artefact, from the hands of Chaos Lord Zymran\u2019s forces. With a mighty company under your command, you must engage in campaign scenarios and skirmishes, defeating the forces of Chaos and completing objectives to bring you closer to acquiring the artefact and defeating the heretics. \nAs a turn-based strategy with RPG elements, the game offers you the ability to fully customise your army between missions and augment your forces to ensure strategic superiority. With the might of a Space Marine company at your disposal, you can fully customise your squads down to the last marine, ensuring that only the Emperor\u2019s finest are entering the fray. But be warned, for any suffered losses are not recovered between missions, so you must carefully decide which missions are worthy of your efforts. \nAs SSI\u2019s second entry in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, Chaos Gate marries the lore of the 40,000 universe with the strategic depth of an SSI game and creates an engaging experience that further glorifies the Emperor and the Adeptus Astartes\u2019 Legacy.","franchise":6,"franchises":[6],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19099,19301,16513,11567,26766,848,25657,9789,11550,18310],"tags":[17,18,268435471,268435472,536870981,536871106,536871327,536871409,536871882,536872245,536872272,536872616,536872733,536873122,536873774,536874182,536874694,536875131,536875160,536875196,536875258,536875296,536875309,536875329,536875331,536875358,536875361,536875455,536875464,536875484,536875485,536875901,536876232,536876282,536876309,536876366,536876367,536876415,536876687,536876798,536877034,536877263,536877744,536880183,536880224,536880386,536882902,536882903,536883380,536883382,536883386,536883387,536884835,536885852,1073741827],"developers":[582],"publishers":[1486],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,194,415,497,970,1333,1360,1704,1821,2210,2862,3270,3782,4219,4248,4284,4346,4384,4397,4417,4419,4446,4449,4543,4552,4572,4573,4989,5320,5370,5397,5454,5455,5503,5775,5886,6122,6351,6832,9271,9312,9474,11990,11991,12468,12470,12474,12475,13923,14940],"themes":[17,18],"genres":[15,16],"first_release_date":909792000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":909792000000,"human":"1998-Oct-31","y":1998,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lxpkhgcmpj3iwxymfltz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lxpkhgcmpj3iwxymfltz","width":600,"height":411},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mjydtskzwt0y71ilbqbe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mjydtskzwt0y71ilbqbe","width":600,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jvaw6zmvzcunvqjzjx3z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jvaw6zmvzcunvqjzjx3z","width":600,"height":411},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e0odcwqmxdsxtttmcf0e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e0odcwqmxdsxtttmcf0e","width":600,"height":411},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v3qf1uctw589ob7jypky.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v3qf1uctw589ob7jypky","width":600,"height":411}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"kam4xMGseNU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nlhm1vuiuorehaufq4xt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nlhm1vuiuorehaufq4xt","width":300,"height":385},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Warhammer_40,000:_Chaos_Gate"}]}
