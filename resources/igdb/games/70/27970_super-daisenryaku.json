Sega ported it to the Sega Mega Drive in 1989, putting in a new soundtrack supposedly composed by Tokuhiko Uwabo. Not only was it never released outside Japan, but it does not fully implement TMSS, meaning it will only work on early Model 1 Mega Drives.","collection":2943,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,21642,23345,19376,55590,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827],"tags":[39,268435469,268435471,268435472,536870913,536874694,536875171,536875175,1073741827],"developers":[1798],"publishers":[4468,1798],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1,3782,4259,4263],"themes":[39],"genres":[13,15,16],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[29,86,125],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":641174400000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Apr-27","y":1990,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":609811200000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Apr-29","y":1989,"m":4},{"category":2,"platform":125,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Dai Senryaku","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u5927\u6226\u7565","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/chmrxisk3no2uamstimw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"chmrxisk3no2uamstimw","width":1437,"height":2015}}
