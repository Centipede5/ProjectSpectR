It all started 1993 with the smooth but simple Zen Nihon Pro Wrestling. Then the updated version \"Dash\" was released with new performers, tag team wrestling moves, and the 4 way elimination match. \n \n'Budoukan has the same basic look as the first 2 but everything has been re-drawn. The roster is bigger with 19 wrestlers! And the gameplay is deeper with more moves and a submission system. The music which was excellent in the previous games has been improved further. This is real wrestling, it's All Japan Pro Wrestling!","collection":2988,"popularity":1,"games":[6685,37486,6051,61303,26766,80715,64049,61302,58552,42589],"tags":[268435470,536871146,536872983,536875075,536875183],"category":0,"keywords":[234,2071,4163,4271],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":797212800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":797212800000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Apr-07","y":1995,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":799804800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-May-07","y":1995,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/feyytsotlxzta6csmtk7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"feyytsotlxzta6csmtk7","width":350,"height":627}}
