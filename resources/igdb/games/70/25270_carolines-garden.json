Trying to win the Alun Alun flower festival is a challenging side quest and it is vital to keep developing new types of flowers by doing research and gathering information down the pub (always a good place to come up with a great idea afterall). Unlock new gardens as you go along and keep an eye on your energy and nutrition values while you work hard to complete each mission.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"keywords":[101,2760],"themes":[35],"first_release_date":1269907200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1269907200000,"human":"2010-Mar-30","y":2010,"m":3}]}
