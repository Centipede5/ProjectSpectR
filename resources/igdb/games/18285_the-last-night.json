One where the fight for survival doesn\u2019t mean food and water, but a purpose for living. Human labour and creativity has been rendered obsolete by AI, so people are now defining themselves by what they consume, not what they create. \n \nCharlie is a lower-class citizen who can\u2019t interface with the systems and augmentations of the world around him, due to an accident during his childhood. He\u2019s a citizen of the thriving metropolis and yet he\u2019ll never be a part of it. Then, a chance encounter offers him the chance to be part of something else and take matters into his own hands.","hypes":37,"popularity":9.333333333333334,"games":[36950,25311,55173,105269,29032,37419,33269,28070,28277,26298],"tags":[18,268435464,268435487,268435488,536871015,536872617,536872970,536873159,536875136,536875269,1073741828],"developers":[9376],"publishers":[7079],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[103,1705,2058,2247,4224,4357],"themes":[18],"genres":[8,31,32],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"pulse_count":23,"platforms":[6,14,49],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1546214400000,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":49,"date":1546214400000,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dhyxqxe1plqic24uqmqi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dhyxqxe1plqic24uqmqi","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/paaln5r2kbddtpm6m6qt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"paaln5r2kbddtpm6m6qt","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iuftef411lebikx3zpaz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iuftef411lebikx3zpaz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rervzhv632ncltdjfkvp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rervzhv632ncltdjfkvp","width":1280,"height":534},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/siycxh8mov9ity26eztg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"siycxh8mov9ity26eztg","width":1275,"height":532}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"pupdeq1MoVw"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"vZw1WjnIN8M"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pthhjyke7ou64ufq9ok1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pthhjyke7ou64ufq9ok1","width":756,"height":1080},"external":{"steam":"612400"}}
