Your goal in each level is to climb up and reach a mystical bird with great plumage, while staying one step above the bonus timer which determines how long you may stay on each level. The mountain climber has only one ability; to shoot rope at 45 degree angles which he may then climb up to other platforms. His other action is a stun beam which will allow him to walk past enemies who get too close; but will only work horizontally from him. As for power-ups, on each level is (usually 2) a flashing diamond power-up which will make him invincible and allow him to defeat monsters. Also as a power-up are glowing treasures of some kind which are worth extra points.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,109460,103316,76253,10039,91140,1750,1071,26820],"tags":[1,268435464,1073741828],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129,2426],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[68,52,59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ckgj6af4f7i5qffixa5b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ckgj6af4f7i5qffixa5b","width":1000,"height":1364}}
