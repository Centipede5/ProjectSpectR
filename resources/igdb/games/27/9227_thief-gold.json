{"id":9227,"name":"Thief Gold","slug":"thief-gold","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/thief-gold","created_at":1425856516677,"updated_at":1548544685587,"summary":"Having received training from an enigmatic organization known as the Keepers, Garrett leaves the order and goes back to the life of a thief on the streets of the City. Once you enter the underworld you have to deal with all the consequences - you are not the only one out there looking for decent loot. Hide in the shadows of the dark, savage city. Sneak into old ruins, haunted cathedrals and mansions of the rich. Incapacitate your enemies quietly or in an open fight. This unique sneak-em-up game provides you with a range of means to achieve your goal. Remember though - secrecy is your best friend. \n \nThief Gold is a first-person perspective stealth game. It was the first game to use light and sound gameplay mechanics \u2013 different surfaces cause varying noise (for example carpets are quiet and ceramic tiles are very loud). You can use sound to your advantage - it\u2019s not only your main source of information on how close your enemies are but you can use it to distract them, for example by throwing objects. With unscripted levels, and objectives and paths altered based on difficulty settings, Thief Gold can give you hours of non-repetitive gameplay. \n \nThis extended edition includes all of the missions from the first release, as well as three new missions adapted to the original storyline, with full voice acting and new graphics. It can still be considered the first game in the Thief series.","collection":2,"rating":91.1898587856213,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":90,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":90.59492939281066,"total_rating_count":12,"rating_count":11,"version_parent":2,"version_title":"Gold","games":[19686,55038,44076,18020,102584,76747,28070,37419,37016,27316],"tags":[1,17,19,23,268435461,268435469,268435470,268435487,536870917,536870984,536871135,536871818,536872039,536872060,536872073,536872078,536872609,536873338,536875626,1073741825],"developers":[3],"publishers":[26],"game_engines":[43],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[5,72,223,906,1127,1148,1161,1166,1697,2426,4714],"themes":[1,17,19,23],"genres":[5,13,14,31],"first_release_date":940896000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":940896000000,"human":"1999-Oct-26","y":1999,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ur57iom2ssnmijqweffw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ur57iom2ssnmijqweffw","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lmgttw9y3qcnfonrya1c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lmgttw9y3qcnfonrya1c","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xgxybwer3y5ziehacmad.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xgxybwer3y5ziehacmad","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zvf53bldfoclbloefrab.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zvf53bldfoclbloefrab","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h0kkd3pmiyyqr7hxcskn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h0kkd3pmiyyqr7hxcskn","width":1680,"height":1050}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"hHWYCfuPQHM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wrt6jequxstq3ptwzxip.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wrt6jequxstq3ptwzxip","width":424,"height":500},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/na.square-enix.com\/us\/home"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/211600"}],"external":{"steam":"211600"}}
