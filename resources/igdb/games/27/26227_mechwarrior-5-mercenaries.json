{"id":26227,"name":"MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries","slug":"mechwarrior-5-mercenaries","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/mechwarrior-5-mercenaries","created_at":1480927675052,"updated_at":1547420154234,"summary":"In MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries you will adopt the role of a rookie MechWarrior pilot thrust into combat as the Third Succession War continues to fracture the Inner Sphere. Take contracts from the factions of your choosing and engage in tactical, first-person, PvE \u2018Mech combat through an immersive, career-based Mercenary campaign driven by player choice. Victory, prestige, and profit will not only require skill on the battlefield, but in the acquisition, maintenance, and enhancement of your BattleMechs. \nSet for release in 2018, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries is under development by a dedicated development team at Piranha Games. MechWarrior Online, Piranha\u2019s existing F2P multiplayer-focused tactical \u2018Mech combat game, will continue its ongoing live development by the MWO team at Piranha.","storyline":"The year is 3015. \nHumanity has expanded to the stars, colonizing a vast region of space known as the Inner Sphere. Where the Star League once ruled in relative stability, generations of countless wars, alliances, and betrayals have divided the Inner Sphere into five distinct Successor States. These states, also known as the Great Houses, have fought and quarreled for centuries over the remnants of the Star League and control of the Inner Sphere. They are now in the midst of a Third Succession War, one which has been raging for almost 150 years. \nWhile the battlefields of the Inner Sphere burn with an array of devastating weaponry, none is more formidable than the BattleMech. These immense fighting machines, piloted by elite fighters known as MechWarriors, dominate the wars of the future with enough firepower to annihilate entire cities.","collection":144,"hypes":6,"popularity":19.66666666666667,"games":[68287,55038,17130,36950,34823,57187,90099,13200,23852,10039],"tags":[1,18,268435460,268435461,268435469,268435480,536870930,536871761,536871762,536871882,536871937,536872060,536875043,1073741825],"developers":[233],"publishers":[233],"game_engines":[439],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[18,849,850,970,1025,1148,4131],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4,5,13,24],"first_release_date":1568073600000,"pulse_count":49,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1568073600000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Sep-10","y":2019,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zxpjycrznlpr8pj11ybw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zxpjycrznlpr8pj11ybw","width":2000,"height":1125},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g9lsk02zdjkrblrr6htn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g9lsk02zdjkrblrr6htn","width":2000,"height":1125},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mrhvsqnzmmasfhkjcj5r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mrhvsqnzmmasfhkjcj5r","width":2000,"height":1125},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vlovmsbdynejc8mdsucj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlovmsbdynejc8mdsucj","width":2000,"height":1125},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nnafra3tsv67tty7qnk5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nnafra3tsv67tty7qnk5","width":2000,"height":1125}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vCXcFJBb6BM"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"ztqhTjLVfgs"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Gz8Y1V8gy1A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1idu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1idu","width":900,"height":1200},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MW5Mercs"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/mw5mercs"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.mw5mercs.com\/"}]}
