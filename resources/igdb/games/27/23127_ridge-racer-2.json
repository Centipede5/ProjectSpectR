{"id":23127,"name":"Ridge Racer 2","slug":"ridge-racer-2","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/ridge-racer-2","created_at":1472042979799,"updated_at":1515728300091,"summary":"Ridge Racer 2 (\u30ea\u30c3\u30b8\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc2 Rijji R\u0113s\u0101 Tsu?) is a racing arcade game that had been released by Namco in 1994; it runs on their System 22 hardware, and as the name suggests, it is the sequel to Ridge Racer which had been released in the previous year. As with the four Final Lap games, Four Trax (which was only released in Japan) and Suzuka 8 Hours, up to eight players can play simultaneously when four two-player cabinets are linked together - and a player's number determines which of the eight cars he or she shall be driving, because in the original, only the red one affiliated with \"Team F\/A\" is available. The gameplay is very much like that of the original (except for the aforementioned fact that up to eight players can play simultaneously), there are six new songs that can be selected with the gear shifter at the start, the enormous television screen above the entrance to the first tunnel is now playing the game of Galaxian (as in the original, it was playing Mappy), all the billboards are now for earlier Namco games, and there is now a rear-view mirror at the top of the screen (so a player can see other players' or even the CPU-controlled cars coming from behind), as well as a change in daylight from day to night (for when a player drives his, or her, car into the track's tunnel during the day, it will come out of the other end in the night); the game was later followed by a true sequel, Rave Racer, in 1995.","collection":946,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[14363,20201,26709,65921,40470,58785,28856,19539,67625,70773],"tags":[268435466,536872590,536872695,536873064,536873390,536874337,536874907,536875069,536875117,536875194,536876787,536876818,536878438,536879068,536881349],"category":0,"keywords":[1678,1783,2152,2478,3425,3995,4157,4205,4282,5875,5906,7526,8156,10437],"genres":[10],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ridge Racers 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ff84umx6l59tsnoyhg8p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ff84umx6l59tsnoyhg8p","width":256,"height":440},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
