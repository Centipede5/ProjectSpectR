The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,33269,1073,71628,19150,1066,24426,10039,55173,29032],"tags":[1,268435464,536872961],"category":0,"keywords":[2049],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/swvwydybcmt2ykyfryx2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"swvwydybcmt2ykyfryx2","width":1440,"height":1350}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l6bljvrxpmfruipubswk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l6bljvrxpmfruipubswk","width":850,"height":1197}}
