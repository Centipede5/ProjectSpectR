{"id":10927,"name":"Steel & Steam: Episode 1","slug":"steel-and-steam-episode-1","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/steel-and-steam-episode-1","created_at":1433236488630,"updated_at":1523252352416,"summary":"The desert plague is spreading from the East: a reminder of a destructive past. Man has evolved since the wars of old, creating new ways to combat this deadly expanse. Using Steel and Steam, man fights this terror, as well as the monsters that spawn from its touch.\n\nNow covering half the continent of Terra Corpus, the desert\u00eds slow and steady hunger is threatening to consume and corrupt all life in the world. Some of the desperate seek out legends of the past: elemental guardians said to sleep inside the planet. Once resurrected, these powerful beings can be controlled, and guided to stop the desert.\n\nThe legends speak of a chosen few who have the ability to tame these elemental beings and reshape the world.\n\nOur story begins with one such person.\n\nSteel & Steam takes the best elements from the fantasy JRPGs of old, such as great stories, awesome characters, and classic monsters, and combines them with a touch of steampunk. It\u00eds like taking Lord of the Rings and mixing in the Wild West.\n\nIt's a game where you, the player, decide how to interact with the game. The classic games usually had a linear, player-focused story moving the game forward. Steel & Steam follows this model, but also gives you the option of moving the story forward through multiple, intertwined story lines. Any character you meet has the potential to affect the end. Will you or will you not save the world? Who you interact with, and how, will affect the way the ending is played out. Whatever happens in one city or town can affect another. These choices give additional life to the world of Steel & Steam.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"publishers":[5257],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1405468800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1405468800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jul-16","y":2014,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i6j6tmpgta29nqhqxjhf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i6j6tmpgta29nqhqxjhf","width":540,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vvgaskmxzfuegfyovi63.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vvgaskmxzfuegfyovi63","width":540,"height":410},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xauzouxgfpzron00gzng.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xauzouxgfpzron00gzng","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ps7b2ycekmdmkpnmsqqe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ps7b2ycekmdmkpnmsqqe","width":550,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zzednanlnzddmjrsltob.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zzednanlnzddmjrsltob","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l1hzdzqeuci6vky6o8lo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l1hzdzqeuci6vky6o8lo","width":460,"height":215},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.redmeatgames.ca"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/310450"}],"external":{"steam":"310450"}}
