A maze is displayed on the screen. The first player controls the Pursuer which is represented by a square and the second player controls the Pursued which is represented by a plus sign. As the Pursuer moves closer and closer to the Pursued, an electronic beep sound increases in frequency to a feverish pitch until the Pursuer catches the Pursued. Each time, the Pursuer catches the Pursued, a point is scored and the chase starts over again.","popularity":2,"games":[6361,27092,34269,25311,55036,29173,36553,55590,95340,32510],"tags":[1,268435471,268435486,268435489,536871599,536871846,536874694,536875411,536875412,536876292,536876642,536879153,536879173,536881123,1073741827],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[687,934,3782,4499,4500,5380,5730,8241,8261,10211],"themes":[1],"genres":[15,30,33],"first_release_date":119145600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":119145600000,"human":"1973-Oct-11","y":1973,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h9k1jsp7cdi4snfngbmw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h9k1jsp7cdi4snfngbmw","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wreb30n4p64kdigwxitl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wreb30n4p64kdigwxitl","width":850,"height":1103}}
