He then walks away in this mysterious place to find the essence of his sudden crysis. Will he make it? Or get worse?","storyline":"The name is Pandemonic Issues, and I'm designing it to be a Table-Top Turn-Based RPG, with its own mechanics. I'll be dividing info in sections with its own arts, so I hope you enjoy it.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt tells the story of a 9 year boy, named di0, who inconciously ends up appearing in a very dark and strange place. Only things he remembers is his own name and the very depressive sensation that comes from nowhere. When this time comes, that's nothing anyone can do, besides watch him starting crying while falling to the ground.\r\r\n\r\r\nHere's a strange note found:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Hi, that is di0. He's 9 years old, though he looks like younger due to his height.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhy does he have a purple hair, you ask me? I don't have that answer, but I believe time will be the only one to tell us about.\r\r\n\r\r\ndi0 knows nothing else about him, but knows how to write his own name with a 0. That seems important to him. Curiously, he refuses to talk and opening his eyes too, I just don't know what to do anymore.\r\r\n\r\r\nBut it's his sudden and severe crysis what worries me more, as if something have been completely taking him for 'good'\r\r\n\r\r\nI do remember seeing sometimes a black aurea surrounding him and... Hm? I... I......... NOOOO!\r\r\n\r\r\nNO!\r\r\n\r\r\nI need help!\" - Eaf.\r\r\n\r\r\n--\r\r\n\r\r\nAs if things couldn't get worse, I present you Unkn.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe's a extremely strange being and known for no one. Few were who did see him, and what they tell is they died the worst way possible, each of them being dismembered in 3 parts, each in 6 agonizing seconds. Even with their smashed hearts and brains, Unkn assured to make them concious, only to hear your satisfaction laugh. That said, he ended up becoming the most feared being of Hades.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"I'm going to eat your entrails, break your legs and arms and give them to the Devil, boy.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nHere's what they use to say:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Unkn is a monster who loves torture and got a tremendous hate if a human gets near him.\r\r\nIf you're unluck to meet him, stop, there's nothing more to do. Your miserable life is over\".\r\r\n\r\r\n--\r\r\n\r\r\nAs mentioned above, game is going to be in Hades, the Devil's precious home. Curiously enough, what do you think, di0 will get any better or worse ending up into such a place, filled with darkness, sadness and damned creatures? Where a second chance has been lost, forever. Is it still a path of light? Even in the shadowest place?\r\r\n\r\r\nIn such severe condition, why ending up just there?\r\r\n\r\r\nBut what about Pandemonic Issues' specific gameplay mechanics? Well, this is being worked on and added right now, so I'll be revealing this once I finish it. See ya!","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26710,44076,36608,49414,16468,27266,59516,13189,13196,19567],"tags":[19,268435468,536871135,536871390,536871963,536872460,536874115,536874116,536874117,1073741827],"developers":[11911],"publishers":[11911],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[223,478,1051,1548,3203,3204,3205],"themes":[19],"genres":[12],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g1ku8ds4cp8ohdacnytu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g1ku8ds4cp8ohdacnytu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sgsimhkj7oiwum2g6sco.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sgsimhkj7oiwum2g6sco","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uryvuudmisigl1zwonnc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uryvuudmisigl1zwonnc","width":1002,"height":1600},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/di0nizus"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/di0nizus"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/eerienous.blogspot.com.br"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/tinyurl.com\/eerieNousFB"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/eerienous.blogspot.com.br"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/di0nizus"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/di0nizus.deviantart.com"}]}
