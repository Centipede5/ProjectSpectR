The game carries the MLBPA license, but not an MLB license, so it only features all the players from the 1991 season playing for a team in a city that they really play for. Players get to play in either a dome, modern, or traditional stadium each with their own unique characteristics.","collection":3166,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[5332,37854,69398,67390,66208,66197,65284,64377,64044,62299],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536875175],"category":0,"keywords":[20,4263],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Family Stadium","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Super Famista","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tmawqixcifsav18t3dug.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tmawqixcifsav18t3dug","width":657,"height":457}}
