And in 1917 two of its descendants are summoned by fate into epic battle. Their enemy? The most evil incarnation of Castlevania legacy to ever rise from the grave, the vampiress Countess Bartley. This spine-tingling, 6-stage fear-fest overflows with graphic sights and sounds from your worst nightmares. As John Morris, the whip wielding vampire hunter, or Eric Lecarde, master lanceman, you'll pursue the demonic Countess all across Europe before she resurrects Dracula for a final reign of global terror. Alas, her trail of doom is laden with zombies, hideous mutants, grotesque giants, ghouls and ghastly creatures. Taste the sweat dripping into your mouth as you try rescuing yourself from diabolical traps. Feel the torturous strain on every muscle as you wield again and again sacred weapon power-ups such as Holy Water, the Battle Axe, the Crystal Blade Boomerang and the Mirror of Truth. But in the end, make sure you've saved enough strength to scream!","storyline":"In 1897, the long war between humanity and Dracula came to an end, as Dracula was laid to eternal rest by Quincey Morris, a distant descendant of the Belmont family. Peace was restored to Europe, until the outbreak of the First World War, which transformed the continent into a dark world filled with massacre and violence. At the beginning of the war, in June 1914 at Sarajevo, the Crown Prince of Austria was assassinated. It was said that a strange beautiful woman was involved, within the shadows. It was Elizabeth Bartley. In order to revive her uncle, Count Dracula, she conducted an unholy ceremony which caused the war, giving her possession of human souls from Europe. \n \nThe game itself takes place in 1917. The characters are John Morris, a distant descendant of the famed Belmont and Morris families who obeyed his fate to fight vampires day and night, and Eric Lecarde, whose girlfriend was transformed into a vampire when Elizabeth was revived. After Drolta Tzuentes resurrected Elizabeth Bartley, they traveled across Europe to conduct the resurrection of Count Dracula. John Morris and Eric Lecarde followed them. Even though the resurrection of Dracula was a success, the vampire hunters defeated him, and his allies.","collection":65,"franchise":895,"franchises":[895],"rating":77.343164341118,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"total_rating":77.343164341118,"total_rating_count":21,"rating_count":21,"games":[1114,2933,1128,24426,56033,1132,1134,20342,3222,19150],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536871041,536871123,536871208,536871213,536871470,536871535,536871610,536871939,536871971,536872098,536872225,536872232,536872961,536873017,536873023,536873064,536873327,536873473,536874398,536874743,536875073,536875077,536875201,536875265,536875317,536875319,536875671,536875689,536875745,536875758,536875767,536875778,536875830,536875837,536875871,536875941,536875942,536876007,536876058,536876087,536876120,536876220,536876270,536876302,536876353,536876437,536876443,536876499,536876764,536876967,536877383,536877689,536878009,536878192,536879024,536879794,536882212,536883904,1073741828],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[129,211,296,301,558,623,698,1027,1059,1186,1313,1320,2049,2105,2111,2152,2415,2561,3486,3831,4161,4165,4289,4353,4405,4407,4759,4777,4833,4846,4855,4866,4918,4925,4959,5029,5030,5095,5146,5175,5208,5308,5358,5390,5441,5525,5531,5587,5852,6055,6471,6777,7097,7280,8112,8882,11300,12992],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":763862400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":763862400000,"human":"1994-Mar-17","y":1994,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Castlevania: The New Generation","comment":"European title"},{"name":"Vampire Killer","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ddxj7g9s9t30m1zsg5vy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ddxj7g9s9t30m1zsg5vy","width":1157,"height":809},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/urzqrotc1nyeprhlmgkb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"urzqrotc1nyeprhlmgkb","width":1156,"height":808},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qpnglsybyx3zasf10wbo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qpnglsybyx3zasf10wbo","width":1159,"height":813},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hlecfl7rviux3hgqcgve.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hlecfl7rviux3hgqcgve","width":1157,"height":811},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f5vvbrogxlpfu8hov8no.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f5vvbrogxlpfu8hov8no","width":1163,"height":813}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hn4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hn4","width":800,"height":1132},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Castlevania:_Bloodlines"}]}
