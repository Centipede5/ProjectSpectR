Players mostly punch and kick opponents to drain their health meters; fighters also can use special moves that can include weapons (e.g., oversized guns, swords, lasers), energy blasts, or magic spells. Combat is highlighted by battle cries, impact sounds, and light effects. A gallery of still images sometimes depicts characters with smears of blood on their bodies or faces. The Gallery mode also includes images of female characters in provocative poses (e.g., arms covering bare breasts; characters bent over), or with partially exposed buttocks and breasts.
