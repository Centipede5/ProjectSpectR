Multitudes of characters to interact with, a plethora of monsters and lots of side-quests litter the landscape of Aveyond. Even though the fighting is turn-based when actually in combat, the player has the ability to avoid prowling enemies before getting into a situation. Your character will level up and can even buy a house to live in, form parties to take on quests as a group. The game was created using RPG Maker XP. The original version of the game ships with Midi music; however, players can replace these with a downloadable high-quality live version.","collection":1337,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1137628800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1137628800000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Jan-19","y":2006,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bx4tyy6iwmblylwykgwl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bx4tyy6iwmblylwykgwl","width":200,"height":171}}
