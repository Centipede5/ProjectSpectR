It is known outside Japan as \"JoJo's Venture\". \n \nYou choose one of the six heroes, or one of the four villains, to go kill the vampire Dio Brando. Each character has a seperate, ongoing storyline. You control your character like in any other Street Fighter-type game, but special moves are done by using the \"stand\" button to call upon your \"Stand\" -- your psychic persona. Each \"Stand\" has a different power, from speed, to fire control, to stopping time.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75962,46815,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704],"tags":[268435460],"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":912470400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":912470400000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Dec-01","y":1998,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i9ilpgfk9ho4tu5zpguc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i9ilpgfk9ho4tu5zpguc","width":850,"height":1196}}
