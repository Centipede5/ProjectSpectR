There are eight playable characters, each having different abilities. In one-player mode, the player is forced to choose Hebereke and must play against Oh-Chan. After defeating Oh-Chan, the player is allowed to choose between Hebereke and Oh-Chan in the next match against Sukezaemon, and so on, until the player has \"unlocked\" all the characters. Each match consists of a single-round. A defeated player may elect to resume play by using a continue. In two-player mode, all characters are immediately available to either player and each match is the best of three rounds. Players can also select a handicap level (from 1 - 5) to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game.","collection":3905,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[25222,60044,8197,18167,26223,11588,14047,60,76098,28113],"tags":[27,268435465,536871262,536873787,536875122,536875155,536875379,536880042],"category":0,"keywords":[350,2875,4210,4243,4467,9130],"themes":[27],"genres":[9],"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":19,"region":8,"human":"TBD"}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u3078\u3079\u308c\u3051\u306e\u307d\u3077\u30fc\u3093","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Hebereke no Popuun","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/in4uqaecrckhwxehloc9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"in4uqaecrckhwxehloc9","width":3508,"height":4961}}
