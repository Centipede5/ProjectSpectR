The worker cells are indestructible but the bricks dropped by them can be temporarily destroyed using the ship's weapon. The goal of the game is to collect enough star cells contained inside the cities to get to the next level. \n \nBy collecting enough star cells within a strict time limit (displayed in the lower score table) it is possible to skip the remaining levels in current star system and pass on to the next, allowing skilled players to advance the game quicker. \n \nThe game was well received, gaining a score of 92% in the well-known computer games magazine Zzap!64.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,71455,27314,25300,142,76246,76722],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871882,1073741827],"publishers":[7146],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[970],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":555984000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":555984000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Aug-15","y":1987,"m":8}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"SB8pdkmJEjY"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jvwmwcxuoad7tslfgfeu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jvwmwcxuoad7tslfgfeu","width":1000,"height":951}}
