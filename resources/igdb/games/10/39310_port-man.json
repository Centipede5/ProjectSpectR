The second level, you throw a rock up at some crates of dynamite, knocking one down. You need to catch it before it hits bottom. When a crate reaches bottom it explodes, removing the lowest level of your playing area. If you are hit by a rock thrown by the man on the conveyer belt or if you are on the same level with the exploding crate, you lose a life. You get points for every crate you catch.
