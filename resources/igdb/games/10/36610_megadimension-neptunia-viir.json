As players explore dungeon-like dimensions, they engage in turn-based battles against monsters (e.g., robots, demons) and other goddesses. Characters use swords, axes, lances, firearms, and energy blasts to deplete enemies' hit points. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, cries of pain, and occasional gunfire. Some characters wear outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage and buttocks; some scenes depict characters partially nude with drops of water, steam, or strands of hair barely covering their nipples and genitalia. Dialogue also includes some suggestive material: \u201cI wish to obtain every last figure and magazine of busty blondes, ever!\u201d; \"All you did was throw around a bunch of dirty magazines!\"; \"[H]er chest hasn't developed...She's flat as a board...\" The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/774511"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/neptunia.wikia.com\/wiki\/Megadimension_Neptunia_VIIR"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/ideafintl.com\/nep-v2r\/"}],"external":{"steam":"774511"}}
