A coalition of Milky Way races \u2014 which includes humans, asari, turians, salarians and the krogan \u2014 participates in this 600-year expedition and placed in cryostasis to ensure that they do not age during the trip. Prior to the journey, the Initiative had identified 'golden worlds' in Andromeda's Heleus cluster, locations that are deemed highly viable for habitation. Each ark consists of a team that are led by a Pathfinder who is tasked to explore and ensure these worlds or any other potential locations are hospitable before settlement can begin.","collection":25,"franchise":1048,"franchises":[1048],"hypes":177,"rating":74.9833579664569,"popularity":27,"aggregated_rating":73.2173913043478,"aggregated_rating_count":30,"total_rating":74.10037463540235,"total_rating_count":159,"rating_count":129,"games":[25076,36950,55038,11156,25300,18290,55092,17447,36198,19560],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435468,268435487,536870915,536871882,536871886,536871938,536871945,536871957,536872205,536873156,536873455,536875046,536875157,536875239,536875265,536875270,536875432,536875453,536875766,536875795,536875802,536875819,536876227,536877300,536878000,536879076,536881483,536882614,536884963,536884964,536885008,536885986,536889111,536889112,536889113,536889114,536889115,536889116,1073741826],"developers":[3903],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[491],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":169200,"completely":288000},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[3,970,974,1026,1033,1045,1293,2244,2543,4134,4245,4327,4353,4358,4520,4541,4854,4883,4890,4907,5315,6388,7088,8164,10571,11702,14051,14052,14096,15074,18199,18200,18201,18202,18203,18204],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,12,31],"first_release_date":1490054400000,"pulse_count":610,"platforms":[6,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1490140800000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Mar-22","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1490054400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Mar-21","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1490227200000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Mar-23","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1490054400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Mar-21","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1490054400000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Mar-21","y":2017,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1490227200000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Mar-23","y":2017,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Mass Effect 4","comment":"Previous name"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fq8e0gyyv4kupamkawyu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fq8e0gyyv4kupamkawyu","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/og2vhbqftsdljfhornu1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"og2vhbqftsdljfhornu1","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zxhpemg4tyhgrce1lgne.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zxhpemg4tyhgrce1lgne","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vnkudolgmkdmv0edwqqj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vnkudolgmkdmv0edwqqj","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mdi22rsmhd0eaepita2w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mdi22rsmhd0eaepita2w","width":1920,"height":1080}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/abudtw3hgnpmzzfgq4ke.jpg","cloudinary_id":"abudtw3hgnpmzzfgq4ke","width":1260,"height":710},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iurlue6l3vscj9nz4kz4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iurlue6l3vscj9nz4kz4","width":1100,"height":1045},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qccmadt4vvqnxkgwwthp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qccmadt4vvqnxkgwwthp","width":1260,"height":710},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lkvpidqvvnajoykvxi1q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lkvpidqvvnajoykvxi1q","width":1260,"height":710},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n7baii7wk0xoh1n5ynjd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n7baii7wk0xoh1n5ynjd","width":1260,"height":670},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vuc7o8ailxf6xpjwbev5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vuc7o8ailxf6xpjwbev5","width":1260,"height":710},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mixwjddyjhgfimx4ych0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mixwjddyjhgfimx4ych0","width":1260,"height":735}],"videos":[{"name":"Natalie Dormer Voice Over Trailer","video_id":"A42U-QERIcw"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"uG8V9dRqSsw"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"JsUG00sKyT4"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"y2vgHOXeps0"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"pyZw_oqk7Q8"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"SPkv7DmeM1A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xnvhxhknmx6qjaxbip0j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xnvhxhknmx6qjaxbip0j","width":341,"height":480},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action role-playing game in which players lead humanity to a new home across the galaxy.
