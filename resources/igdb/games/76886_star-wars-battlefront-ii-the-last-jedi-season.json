On December 5, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to align with the First Order or choose to fight for the Resistance. Your choice is important, as it will allow you to take part in special challenges that will grant your faction specific rewards. \n \nThings kick into high gear on December 13. Your favorite stormtrooper-turned-hero Finn joins the fight for the Resistance and Captain Phasma steps on to the Battlefront for the First Order. They can be purchased with in-game Credits from that week. Whichever faction is victorious in completing the most challenges that week will net a reward as well: a special Crate of high-power upgrades for Finn or Captain Phasma. \n \nNew locations and vehicles will also arrive. On December 13, the cinematic content from Star Wars\u2122: The Last Jedi continues with a new planetary map: Crait. The Starfighter Assault map of D'Qar will join as well, plus a new hero ship \u2013 Tallie Lintra's RZ-2 A-wing. Poe Dameron\u2019s T-70 X-wing is also upgraded with a new ability inspired by Star Wars\u2122: The Last Jedi . \n \nIden Versio returns. In Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II Resurrection, you\u2019ll join Commander Iden Versio during the days of the First Order\u2019s rise to power. These new chapters of Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II\u2019s single-player story mode will be available December 13. \n \nYour choice of faction will continue to matter. Throughout December, you'll see your chosen faction's progress reflected in-game, as you fight alongside allies from around the world to swing the tide of battle.","storyline":"In Star Wars\u2122 Battlefront\u2122 II Resurrection, you\u2019ll join Commander Iden Versio during the days of the First Order\u2019s rise to power.","collection":4191,"franchise":1,"franchises":[1],"popularity":3,"game":26401,"games":[],"tags":[536874009],"developers":[94],"publishers":[1],"category":1,"keywords":[3097],"first_release_date":1512432000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1512432000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-05","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1512432000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-05","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1512432000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-05","y":2017,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Star Wars Battlefront II - Season 1"},{"name":"Star Wars Battlefront II - The Last Jedi"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nmidusmmktweytduzvjt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nmidusmmktweytduzvjt","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jylijmq4zzury9kikvmu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jylijmq4zzury9kikvmu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ivvkjxtbja75dgb9ev4l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ivvkjxtbja75dgb9ev4l","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p4lb1f9969nrrtt6ztjw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p4lb1f9969nrrtt6ztjw","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mbriw5muumpv4g5schl0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mbriw5muumpv4g5schl0","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"n0-ye4LXWts"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jjeixwptyrnaawl2fayk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jjeixwptyrnaawl2fayk","width":573,"height":818},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.ea.com\/en-gb\/games\/starwars\/battlefront\/battlefront-2\/news\/the-last-jedi-season-is-coming"}]}
