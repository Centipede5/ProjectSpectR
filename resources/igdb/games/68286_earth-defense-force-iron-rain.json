It flew over United States to Russia, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe only in three days. \nHuman beings established a ground defense force (called the EDF) ahead of the national fence and fought back against the invaders. However, the war situation was in bad condition and the beautiful cities began to turn into mountain of rubbles. \nAs a result, the important military bases of the world that could possibly be opposed to the invaders were all already destroyed. \nThere were nothing left for the human beings to do and all they could do was to wait for the world to end\u2026.","collection":818,"popularity":5.333333333333333,"games":[68287,55038,28751,90099,18088,36950,28029,57187,78770,23852],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870913,536871882,536871937,536875171,1073741826],"developers":[1059],"publishers":[449],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[1,970,1025,4259],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1554940800000,"pulse_count":45,"platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1554940800000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Apr-11","y":2019,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"EDF: Iron Rain","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rzi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rzi","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rzh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rzh","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rzg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rzg","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rzf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rzf","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rze.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rze","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rzd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rzd","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rzc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rzc","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rzb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rzb","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rza.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rza","width":3840,"height":2160}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar4xg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar4xg","width":7680,"height":4320},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar4xh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar4xh","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"wvSAFOMr-DA"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"X_HTPRN8ynw"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"D6vsm4XNx1A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1iyx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1iyx","width":1296,"height":1728},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.d3p.co.jp\/edfir\/en\/"}]}
