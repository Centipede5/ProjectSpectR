Players attend class to learn magic skills that can be used in battle against giant insects, lizard men, griffins, and slime monsters. Players attack the monsters in turn-based combat with a variety of weapons (e.g., swords, giant hammers, rocket gloves) and alchemy spells. One of the enemies is a half-human, half-plant creature that is depicted with exposed breasts during part of the battle. During the course of the game, characters sometimes make provocative or suggestive comments (e.g., \"I'm going to...put you in the downward dog of love position\" and \"\u2026I'll use my body to clean every last part of your tight little bod\"). Some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t,\" \"a*s,\" and \"hell\") and references to alcohol (e.g., \"what are your plans after getting me drunk?\" and \"He can't hold his liquor too well\") can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/nisamerica.com\/games\/mk2\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mana_Khemia_2:_Fall_of_Alchemy"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/atelier.wikia.com\/wiki\/Mana_Khemia_2:_Fall_of_Alchemy"}]}
