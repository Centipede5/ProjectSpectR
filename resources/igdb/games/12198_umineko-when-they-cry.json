The story focuses on a group of eighteen people on a secluded island for a period of two days, and the mysterious murders that befall most of the people. The goal of the game is to discern whether the murderer is human or of some other supernatural source. The original releases contain no voice acting for the characters. While during gameplay, the Tips Mode can be viewed via the game's internal menu, which also includes save and load functions. These tips allow the player to read various supplementary information on the characters and story that may or may not be useful in solving the mystery. The ultimate goals of the gameplay involve reaching the truth behind the multi-cased mystery, determining where the gold is hidden, figuring out a solution in which ultimately everyone survives, and to solve the whole case by determining who the true murderer is in each chapter and whether it is due to supernatural events or human actions.","collection":1622,"rating":99.8502271348822,"popularity":10.66666666666667,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":89.9251135674411,"total_rating_count":11,"rating_count":10,"games":[13189,51524,59218,15830,11296,56033,18011,17906,54678,26658],"tags":[19,20,31,268435487,536870990,536871006,536871046,536871109,536871138,536871208,536871249,536871939,536872017,536872032,536872350,1073741829,1073741826],"developers":[5187],"publishers":[5187,817,2997,5188],"game_engines":[219],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,94,134,197,226,296,337,1027,1105,1120,1438],"themes":[19,20,31],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1187308800000,"platforms":[6,39,9,38,55],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1467936000000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Jul-08","y":2016,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1187308800000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Aug-17","y":2007,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1292457600000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Dec-16","y":2010,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1319068800000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Oct-20","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1363132800000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Mar-13","y":2013,"m":3},{"category":7,"platform":6,"region":8,"human":"TBD"},{"category":0,"platform":55,"date":1238457600000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Mar-31","y":2009,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u3046\u307f\u306d\u3053\u306e\u306a\u304f\u9803\u306b","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Umineko no Naku Koro ni"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jzzfikulhint3xn2pp8x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jzzfikulhint3xn2pp8x","width":625,"height":352},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uvpoouetcirahlxmhikh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uvpoouetcirahlxmhikh","width":625,"height":352},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qwftl9fmvmozsstcrebl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qwftl9fmvmozsstcrebl","width":625,"height":352},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oznjrw4v4wwryzj2t7cv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oznjrw4v4wwryzj2t7cv","width":625,"height":352},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/acixzjqaxvm91r1ywnv4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"acixzjqaxvm91r1ywnv4","width":625,"height":352}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"YiJ4WVtoptY"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"1RsPxWqvygg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j7dtbfzpyfueji2ilqq1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j7dtbfzpyfueji2ilqq1","width":1000,"height":1161},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/406550"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/07th-expansion.net\/"}],"external":{"steam":"406550"}}
