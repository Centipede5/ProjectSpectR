The game mixes traditional platforming and role-playing elements, as Tails is using different items and abilities, as well piloting his creations Remote Robot and Sea Fox, to travel across Cocoa Island to liberate it from the Battle Kukku Empire. Like many Sonic games for the Game Gear, Tails Adventure has been ported onto numerous compilation titles and other games as an unlockable game. It later received a re-release on the Nintendo 3DS in 2013.","collection":2156,"franchise":814,"franchises":[814],"rating":70,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":1,"games":[28070,1039,25646,37419,20342,27880,24426,78632,89074,29032],"tags":[1,268435464,268435465,268435487,1073741828],"developers":[787],"publishers":[4981],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,9,31],"first_release_date":811728000000,"platforms":[35,47,37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1364947200000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Apr-03","y":2013,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1371686400000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Jun-20","y":2013,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1371686400000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Jun-20","y":2013,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":47,"date":1371686400000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Jun-20","y":2013,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":47,"date":1364947200000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Apr-03","y":2013,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":816048000000,"region":2,"human":"1995-Nov-11","y":1995,"m":11},{"category":2,"platform":35,"date":820368000000,"region":1,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":811728000000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Sep-22","y":1995,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30c6\u30a4\u30eb\u30b9\u30a2\u30c9\u30d9\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u30fc","comment":"Japanese spelling"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ikidazk0oppdmwclshtx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ikidazk0oppdmwclshtx","width":320,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lypwh2qivo3tr3n2hgbv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lypwh2qivo3tr3n2hgbv","width":320,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r1woo96fysstp3uopvgu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r1woo96fysstp3uopvgu","width":320,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nqh5eiqrvxb5hu0inkoe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nqh5eiqrvxb5hu0inkoe","width":640,"height":576},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mn2gpc0badb0nrydcyzi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mn2gpc0badb0nrydcyzi","width":400,"height":308},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fkylxhwp9obt2lp8k5gs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fkylxhwp9obt2lp8k5gs","width":401,"height":309},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/szcp8q1tpbo4o33mbejr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"szcp8q1tpbo4o33mbejr","width":401,"height":308}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qn2c8t4hvmbgomdz0duj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qn2c8t4hvmbgomdz0duj","width":1000,"height":1380},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tails_Adventure"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/sonic.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tails_Adventure"}]}
