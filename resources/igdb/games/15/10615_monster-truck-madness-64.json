However, the game engine is essentially the same as that utilized in the original game. A testament to their similarity is the fact that most custom trucks and tracks are compatible with both games. \n \nThe \"Summit Rumble\" king of the hill tracks could only be played if one intended to compete online. \n \nAgain, \"Army\" Armstrong provides commentary for the game.
