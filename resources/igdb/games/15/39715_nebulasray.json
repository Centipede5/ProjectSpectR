Nebulas Ray has many 3-D elements and very detailed graphics.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76246,19341,28029,32902,24920,272,68287,10039,68142,36608],"tags":[1,268435461],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":760233600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":760233600000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-03","y":1994,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c8ninwdny8yisjcytzvi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c8ninwdny8yisjcytzvi","width":1192,"height":850}}
