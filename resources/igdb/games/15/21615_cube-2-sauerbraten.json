The game features single-player and multiplayer gameplay and contains an in-game level editor. The game engine is free and open-source software, under the zlib License, with commercial support available from the developer's own business counterpart, Dot3 Labs. The game media is released under various non-free licenses. The aim of the project is not to produce the most features and highest-quality graphics possible, but rather to allow map-editing to be done in real-time within the game, while keeping the engine source code small and elegant.","collection":2322,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[7329,29525,26192,37016,44076,25646,7291,68287,7350,6036],"tags":[1,19,268435461,536870981,536871213,536871365,536871456,536871516,536871937,536872032,536872287,536874743,536874947,536875046,536875073,536875265,536875464,536875478,536875483,536875572,536876221,536877047,536877938,536877955,536880737,536880768,536883035,1073741825],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"keywords":[69,301,453,544,604,1025,1120,1375,3831,4035,4134,4161,4353,4552,4566,4571,4660,5309,6135,7026,7043,9825,9856,12123],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1104451200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1104451200000,"human":"2004","y":2004,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sy2vnhjc3mbgraeavp1e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sy2vnhjc3mbgraeavp1e","width":694,"height":295},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/sauerbraten.org\/"}]}
