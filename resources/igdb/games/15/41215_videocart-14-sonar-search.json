Instead of trying to randomly guess what grid an opponent's battleship is on, after the player takes a shot, the player will hear a sonar ping noise. The shorter the noise, the closer the player is to hitting a target. \n \nIn the 1 player game, the player has a limited number of chances to sink the enemy fleet of ships, while in the 2 player game, players take turns trying to sink their opponents ships before having their own ships sunk.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471,1073741827],"developers":[9372],"publishers":[9372],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":257558400000,"platforms":[127],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":127,"date":257558400000,"region":8,"human":"1978-Mar-01","y":1978,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Videocart 12 - Sonar-Peilung"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jwjohxrsjxg3e0r3r59v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jwjohxrsjxg3e0r3r59v","width":612,"height":464}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"j89fCrgyC0A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qh08b3zpvsnbx7ryhyh2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qh08b3zpvsnbx7ryhyh2","width":341,"height":462}}
