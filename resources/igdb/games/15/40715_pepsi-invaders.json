Coco-Cola commissioned a game from Atari to give to their Atlanta employees. In this case, Atari redesigned Space Invaders so that you shoot the letters \"P E P S I\" instead of space creatures. There were 125 copies of this game made. There is no real box for this one, just a flimsy Styrofoam shell. So it isn\u2019t really a prototype, but it wasn\u2019t a commercially available game either. And no, Coca-Cola does not have any copies left.","popularity":1,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}]}
