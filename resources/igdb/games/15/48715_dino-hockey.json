One of the things that makes this game unique, is that there is an extremely limited amount of information about the game. All that is really known about the game, is that there was a mention of the game in the September, 1991 issue of Gamepro magazine, during their writeup of the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. With that in mind, it was more than likely presented at the show. However, there had never been any screenshots of the game in any publication or public medium up to this point. So it\u2019s quite a rare title already, with very little documentation noted.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14]}
