But before you can get them out, you have to get yourself out. That means sneaking through each room. Checking out each floor. Exploring every corner. There's gotta be an escape route somewhere. And as Patches, you have to find it. \n \nCruella's two henchmen, Horace and Jasper, are on your tail. So you better get moving. Because if they catch you, they'll lock you up. And if that happens, you can kiss your spots goodbye!","franchise":162,"franchises":[162],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76397,103232,27266,236,106859,89560,25311,25222,107226,25646],"tags":[268435465,268435471,268435487],"developers":[606],"publishers":[95],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"genres":[9,15,31],"first_release_date":864345600000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":864345600000,"human":"1997-May-23","y":1997,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":864345600000,"human":"1997-May-23","y":1997,"m":5}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/owu2ui6hckk31jx0uodu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"owu2ui6hckk31jx0uodu","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j13yqlyyywgv98mnducp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j13yqlyyywgv98mnducp","width":256,"height":256},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/101_Dalmatians:_Escape_from_DeVil_Manor"}]}
