From a 3\/4\u2013overhead perspective, players control animal- and human-like warriors who use swords, arrows, guns, and magic attacks to kill opponents' minions in melee-style combat. Higher kill counts result in additional achievements (e.g., \u201cleveling up\u201d). Battles are accompanied by slashing sounds, colorful projectiles, and red blood splashes; one vampire warrior's attacks cause larger blood-pooling effects. A variety of female characters are depicted in form-fitting outfits that expose mild cleavage; suggestive jokes can occasionally be heard in the dialogue (e.g., \u201cSorry boys, I keep the fuzzy cuffs at home,\u201d\u201cIs that a rocket in your pocket?\u201d and \u201cFor only $2.95 a minute, I'll leave you breathless.\u201d). One playable character drinks frequently from an oversized cask, slurring phrases such as \u201cThe only time I have a drinking problem is when I spill it\u201d; his Drunken Rage ability can be used to reduce inflicted damage. A few sequences also include warriors with lit cigarettes\/smoking pipes.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for people aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence towards non human looking characters - Non realistic looking violence towards human characters\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/leagueoflegends"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.leagueoflegends.com"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/LeagueOfLegends"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/leagueoflegends"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":5,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
