The gameplay is a mixture of a vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up and Breakout. The player can collect money, which unlocks various bonuses, as well as Arkanoid-style power-ups that include a fireball that will go straight through blocks instead of being deflected. They can also send the bat forward a short distance, which helps to collect items, defeat enemies and hit the ball. \n \nThe game was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom in 1994.","popularity":1,"games":[26223,68324,25222,25646,76098,51464,60044,47823,12632,36926],"tags":[1,27,268435465,536871208,536871262,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[296,350,2875],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":775008000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":775008000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Jul-24","y":1994,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xpupcb9dukzhizfr33zc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xpupcb9dukzhizfr33zc","width":405,"height":741}}
