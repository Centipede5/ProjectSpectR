It is based on Taito's popular 1986 arcade game Bubble Bobble, featuring characters and themes from that game. Its characteristically cute Japanese animation and music, along with its play mechanics and level designs, made it successful as an arcade title and spawned several sequels and ports to home gaming systems.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[60044,25222,14047,26223,19222,27266,41348,10225,78032,72839],"tags":[268435465,536873064,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[2152,2875],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1102032000000,"platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1102032000000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Dec-03","y":2004,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wge9bpa7ysa1unyezutf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wge9bpa7ysa1unyezutf","width":564,"height":682},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
