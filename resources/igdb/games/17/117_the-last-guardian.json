Players can command Trico to zap blocked passages or strike enemies with a lightning attack that shoots from its tail. Enemies in suits of armor generally break into pieces when defeated; though soldiers sometimes emit blood-like flashes or red symbols when injured. In some levels, the player's character can rip the helmets off enemy characters, though no gore is shown. Cutscenes also depict acts of violence and occasional blood: Trico attacked by spears or swords; Trico bleeding from wounds.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence towards non human looking characters - Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Violence causing minor injury only","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Last_Guardian"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/teamico.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Last_Guardian"}]}
