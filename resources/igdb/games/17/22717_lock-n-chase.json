Lock 'n' Chase was Data East's response to Pac-Man. The game's main character is a thief. The object of the game is to enter a maze and collect all the coins and, if possible, any other treasure that may appear. The thief must then exit the maze (a vault) without being apprehended by the Super D (policemen). The thief can close doorways within the maze in order to temporarily trap the Super D and allow him to keep his distance from them. Only two doors can be closed at a time. The Super D policemen are named Stiffy, Scaredy, Smarty, and Silly.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36950,55216,68287,55038,25300,27011,10039,57187,17130,14364],"tags":[1,18,268435464,268435489,536871044,536871599,536871882,536872911,536875108,536875258,536875325,536875347,536875434,536875667,536875690,536876179,536876429,536876505,536876716,536878072,536879184,536879788,1073741827],"developers":[2678],"publishers":[2521],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[132,687,970,1999,4196,4346,4413,4435,4522,4755,4778,5267,5517,5593,5804,7160,8272,8876],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8,33],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[52,67,59,75,37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1320192000000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Nov-02","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1322697600000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Dec-01","y":2011,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1326931200000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jan-19","y":2012,"m":1},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":67,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rbwefw4eccucgiynyb1g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rbwefw4eccucgiynyb1g","width":322,"height":290},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n0rpqrsskvhtgpaybyzw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n0rpqrsskvhtgpaybyzw","width":320,"height":288},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qfaqgvwbzalgwn1tbr9a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qfaqgvwbzalgwn1tbr9a","width":324,"height":288},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pwackjds4zfl1h3sdkub.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pwackjds4zfl1h3sdkub","width":321,"height":288}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y8nx51vildlr4xbhr6fm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y8nx51vildlr4xbhr6fm","width":1000,"height":1358},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
