At the time, it was a highly acclaimed Acornsoft release, with its high resolution graphics, addictive gameplay and fluid animation. \n \nLabyrinth is a scrolling 2D shoot 'em up, consisting of a complex labyrinth made up of multiple levels. Each level is made up of a number of rooms, with the player only able to see a single room at any one time. Doorways are provided allowing the player to move between rooms. \n \nEach level contains two special rooms, the 'Gate Room', and the 'Key Room'. The Gate Room contains an impenetrable gate, beyond which lies the next level. The Key Room contains a jewel which will open the gate, and is generally the most well-guarded and dangerous room in the level.","popularity":2.666666666666667,"games":[62151,236,13189,55038,25222,24426,18398,47823,15537,54775],"tags":[17,268435458,268435461,268435487,536871208,536871939,536871991,536872198,1073741828],"developers":[9,1766],"publishers":[66,1766],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,1027,1079,1286],"themes":[17],"genres":[2,5,31],"first_release_date":536371200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[75,53,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":53,"date":567907200000,"region":5,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hv7xrkcrqrsmd6vmkvte.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hv7xrkcrqrsmd6vmkvte","width":256,"height":327},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/labyrinth.wikia.com\/"}]}
