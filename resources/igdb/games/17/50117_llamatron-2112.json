The llama constantly fires a stream of white energy bolts in the direction it is moving. The player can 'hold' the fire direction, so that the llama can move freely whilst firing in a direction; alternatively the player can control the game with two joysticks, choosing the move and fire directions independently.","popularity":1,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"keywords":[1025,1405,1495,2152,2227,3486,4144,4289,4304,4650,4754,5116,5311,9167],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l92rqhbcoenvpigfvnzt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l92rqhbcoenvpigfvnzt","width":320,"height":200}}
