The power-up system in Spriggan relies on different coloured globes - you can have three of these in stock at any one time and the order they are in will vary what style of weapon you have. This allows for a certain degree of mix-and-match until you find your preferred combination. You can also eject these orbs, which act as a smart bomb in times of need.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[113111,103301,103298,41595,91793,103281,105049,42935,27270,76747],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1ibw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1ibw","width":1410,"height":1394}}
