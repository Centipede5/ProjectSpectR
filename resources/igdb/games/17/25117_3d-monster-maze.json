The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \"graphics\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and the first game incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror.\n\n3D Monster Maze puts the player in a maze with one exit and a hostile monster, the Tyrannosaurus rex. There, the player must traverse the maze, from the first-person perspective, and escape through the exit without being eaten.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,25646,26914,11296,12579,29525,28289,44076,28148,27266],"tags":[1,19,268435487,536871599,536871939,536872032,536872748,536875643,1073741825],"publishers":[11343],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"keywords":[687,1027,1120,1836,4731],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[112],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":112,"date":378604800000,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/te4hhftqmo521q6sad4y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"te4hhftqmo521q6sad4y","width":254,"height":388}}
