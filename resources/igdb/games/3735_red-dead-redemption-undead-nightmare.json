Players roam Wild West environments and use shotguns, pistols, rifles, torches, and dynamite to kill attacking zombies. Players can engage in melee-style hand-to-hand combat and trigger slow-motion effects by shooting enemies at close-range or by targeted shooting (e.g., head shots). Blood often spurts out of characters when shot; close-range assaults cause much larger sprays. Some weapons cause zombies to explode into body parts, and one sequence depicts body parts lying on the ground (e.g., zombies eating a corpse). The game contains zombie characters in revealing outfits and sexual references in the dialogue (e.g, \"I'll give you a quickie later,\"\". . . filthy whore-mongering wretch,\"\"Oh my God, you're a voyeur! You're peeping in on our love.\"). Language such as \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\" can also be heard in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Glamorisation of drugs - Strong language - Content that teaches or encourages gambling\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.rockstargames.com\/reddeadredemption\/dlc\/undead"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/reddead.wikia.com\/wiki\/Undead_Nightmare"}]}
