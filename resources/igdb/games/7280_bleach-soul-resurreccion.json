Players use swords and magic attacks to slash at waves of enemies (e.g., humans, demons) in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by crashing sounds and loud cries of pain; enemies disappear amid bursts of light when defeated. The combat is sometimes underscored by aggressive dialogue such as \u201cI will cut you down right here,\u201d \u201cI'm not done killing yet!\u201d and \u201cI could kill a thousand of these pests.\" Some female characters are depicted in outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; in one cutscene, the camera lingers on a woman's breasts before panning up. The words \u201ca*s\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d can be heard in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bleach:_Soul_Resurrecci%C3%B3n"}]}
