{"id":7103,"name":"NASCAR 08","slug":"nascar-08","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/nascar-08","created_at":1401332806080,"updated_at":1516078311449,"summary":"NASCAR 08 is the eleventh installment of the EA Sports NASCAR series. It was developed by EA Tiburon and released for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This is the earliest that EA has released a NASCAR game. It also marks the first time the original Xbox has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup since NASCAR 2001. \n \nTony Stewart is on the cover marking his third appearance on the cover of an EA Sports NASCAR game. The cover in the PAL region features Juan Pablo Montoya. NASCAR's new Car of Tomorrow as well as the current car are present in the game, although the Car of Tomorrow is generic (no separate manufacturers). ESPN's NASCAR coverage is also integrated into the game. Crew chief dialogue for the PS3 and 360 versions of the game was recorded by Chad Knaus. The Whelen Modified Tour is not included in the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, but is still present in the PS2 version.","collection":147,"franchise":15,"franchises":[15],"rating":70,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":55,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":62.5,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":0,"games":[7104,5943,5946,5944,97,801,1050,4027,5947,14363],"tags":[268435466,268435470,536871313,536871590,536872205,536872245,536872695,536873390,536875061,536875069,536875138,536875562,536875955,536876108,536876419,536876666,536876701,536876786,536877077,536878319,536880839,536880840,536881241,536881348,536882159,536882168,536883028,536883995],"developers":[555,348],"publishers":[454],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[401,678,1293,1333,1783,2478,4149,4157,4226,4650,5043,5196,5507,5754,5789,5874,6165,7407,9927,9928,10329,10436,11247,11256,12116,13083],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":1185148800000,"platforms":[9,12,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1185148800000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Jul-23","y":2007,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1186704000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Aug-10","y":2007,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1185148800000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Jul-23","y":2007,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1185148800000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Jul-23","y":2007,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1185408000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Jul-26","y":2007,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1185408000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Jul-26","y":2007,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1195084800000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Nov-15","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1195084800000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Nov-15","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1195084800000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Nov-15","y":2007,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p2ukctterbqn2cgy1kqr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p2ukctterbqn2cgy1kqr","width":480,"height":270}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/njsbiunnm24mc6teh6b7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"njsbiunnm24mc6teh6b7","width":256,"height":358},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
