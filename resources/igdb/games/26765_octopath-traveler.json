As players explore villages and caves, they interact with locals and battle brigands, monsters, demons, and other fantastical creatures. Combat is turn-based, with players selecting attack moves from a menu. Characters use swords, spears, and magic attacks (e.g., ice spikes, fireballs) to defeat enemies; battles are highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and light effects. One boss character is depicted with a bloody sickle and a bottle of blood; a pool of blood also appears in a cutscene. A handful of female characters wear outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; the dialogue also contains suggestive material (e.g., \u201cThat naughty mouth of yours belongs to me. Put it where it belongs...\u201d and \"Master...go pleasure yourself.\"). One sequence requires players to spike a barrel of wine and give it to others; another scene depicts a slurring, hiccupping man called \u201cCrest-bearing drunk.\u201d The word \u201cbastard\u201d appears in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game was rated PEGI 12 for frequent scenes of offensive and sexual language.
