Players travel across various lands, interact with characters, and engage in battle against humans and fantasy creatures (e.g., hyena-\/jackal-like animals, demons, skeletons). Players use swords, spears, and magic spells to kill several opponents. Combat can be frenetic at times, accompanied by clashing sounds and brief yells. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence: an extended off-screen sequence in which a character is stabbed; a man shot off-screen while crawling away.  Dark blood stains appear on the floors of one level. The game includes some suggestive\/sexual material: female characters dressed in revealing outfits; camera angles that pan suggestively on bodies; women offering companionship to men in a coastal city; dialogue that states \u201c[s]tay clear from them two. Gave me the crotch rot, they did!\u201d Players occasionally encounter characters who consume alcohol (e.g., \u201cJussone more cup, littlemann! Hic!\u201d).
