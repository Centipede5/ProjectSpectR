Its story reveals a poetic world. The graphics and atmosphere are enhanced using contrasts, and bewitching sound effects and music. \n \nYou play Kora who embarks on a quest to find her missing sister. You will need to find the courage to overcome obstacles and face strange creatures to guide her through dangerous levels full of mystery. \nJump, perform wall jumps, toggle switches, request fireflies' assistance to open doors. Control water to find new ways through the levels. Discover many new and interesting gameplay features as you make your way throughout the four worlds of the game. \n \nNOT A CLASSIC PLATFORMER \n \nIn Koloro you can't choose the way of your character. The only way to turn back is to wall jump. So, you will have to face the dangers and to solve puzzles to reach the portal with only the jumping button! \n \nPLAY WITH A FRIEND \n \nYou will also be able to face danger and solve the riddles with a friend as an alternative two-player shared-screen story mode is available.
