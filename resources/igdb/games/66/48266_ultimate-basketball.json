All of the traditional rules of basketball apply as you take control of a fictional team from one of seven American locales. Each team has its own full roster of players as well as unique strengths and weaknesses. For example, Houston has a tight defense and can shoot the three, while Dallas excels at the passing game. \n \nThe point of view is horizontal for the most part. Occasionally, you will get a close-up action scene on plays such as slam dunks and free throws. There are also two different play modes, \"Tournament\" and \"One Game.\" You can play by yourself, against a friend, or with a friend against the computer.","popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[12114,22690,57936,48203,3356,2376,80135,80049,73125,64085],"tags":[268435470,536870970,536872078,536875073],"category":0,"keywords":[58,1166,4161],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":654739200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":654739200000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Oct-01","y":1990,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gjtm8sjd7zb0gmg6dt6t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gjtm8sjd7zb0gmg6dt6t","width":1521,"height":2100}}
