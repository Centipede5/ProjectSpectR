The game is presented in isometric 3D. The player must guide the gyroscope from the top of the course to the bottom within an allotted time limit. If the gyroscope topples off the edge, a life is lost. Hazards on the course include potholes, aliens and glass slopes which cause the gyroscope to spin in random directions. There are five courses comprising four screens each. The gyroscope had to land on a marked square to complete each level.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[51485,55752,10039,1070,24199,1073,19174,26848,42611,66314],"tags":[1,268435464,268435489,536872961,536873064,536875361,536876120,1073741826],"developers":[11738],"publishers":[1985],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2049,2152,4449,5208],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,33],"first_release_date":504835200000,"platforms":[134,69,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":134,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":69,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wo8z5ckomtnoee1qjcmp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wo8z5ckomtnoee1qjcmp","width":762,"height":1203}}
