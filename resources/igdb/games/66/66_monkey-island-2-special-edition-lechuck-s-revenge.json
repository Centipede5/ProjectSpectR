Instead of actually engaging in combat, Guybrush attacks some characters by poking and prodding \"cartoony\" voodoo dolls. In one scene he rips off the leg of a voodoo doll, causing a zombie pirate to lose his arm and leg and spew out splashes of green blood. To solve one of the puzzles, players must compete in a drinking contest during which a character is depicted drinking a mug of grog. The grog is described as having \"twice the alcohol, twice the calories,\" and causes the character to pass out. There is also a scene that depicts a man spitting out green mucus, and players can compete in a spitting contest. The word \"hell\" can be heard once in the dialogue (\"What the hell?\").","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language - Violence causing minor injury only.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Monkey_Island_2:_LeChuck%27s_Revenge#Special_Edition"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/monkeyisland.wikia.com\/wiki\/Monkey_Island_2:_LeChuck%27s_Revenge"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/lol.disney.com\/monkey-island-2-special-edition-lechuck-s-revenge"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/32460"}],"external":{"steam":"32460"}}
