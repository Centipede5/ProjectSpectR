It utilizes the same fully 3D graphical engine, role-playing system, and turn-based battles with visible regular enemies, an indicator that shows the speed of your and the enemies' actions (allowing additional strategies), and two kinds of energy bars for special techniques.","storyline":"For an unknown reason, the sacred goddess shrine on the Shu mountain was destroyed. The head of a kung-fu school, Xu Changqing, ordered a young disciple named Nangong Huang to look for Qinleng, a Chinese deity who has the knowledge of Wu Ling, \"five spiritual wheels\". Only with the help of this knowledge is it possible to restore peace in China. Nangong Huang accepts the mission, willing to prove he is worthy to be the disciple of Shu mountain school, the most highly esteemed school of kung-fu. The young man is not afraid of the dangers that he will have to face, since he is well trained in acrobatics and powerful sword magic. However, he is quite inexperience in love - and among other dangers, that is precisely what awaits him in his adventure!","collection":69,"franchise":1176,"franchises":[1176],"popularity":1,"developers":[14085],"publishers":[14085],"category":0,"themes":[17],"genres":[12,16],"first_release_date":1098921600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1098921600000,"region":6,"human":"2004-Oct-28","y":2004,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Xianjian Qixia Zhuan 3 Waizhuan: Wenqing Pian","comment":"Chinese title"},{"name":"\u4ed9\u528d\u5947\u4fe0\u50b3\u4e09\u5916\u50b3\u00b7\u554f\u60c5\u7bc7","comment":"Chinese title"},{"name":"\u4ed9\u5251\u5947\u4fa0\u4f20\u4e09\u5916\u4f20\u00b7\u95ee\u60c5\u7bc7","comment":"Chinese title"},{"name":"Chinese Paladin 3 Gaiden: Wenqing Pian","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dkwhhmrtbxxulucsbhni.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dkwhhmrtbxxulucsbhni","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kijeffa4bl3zgs89cvfh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kijeffa4bl3zgs89cvfh","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rzxoy2eorijjirhaf6n9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rzxoy2eorijjirhaf6n9","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qacrs6mdeuxflfvkq2rf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qacrs6mdeuxflfvkq2rf","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m6e0yiivh0wcc9sjzjls.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m6e0yiivh0wcc9sjzjls","width":800,"height":600}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hdiojphcvwh8fi5t23jz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hdiojphcvwh8fi5t23jz","width":800,"height":1129}}
