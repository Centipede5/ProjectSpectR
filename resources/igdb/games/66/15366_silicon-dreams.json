{"id":15366,"name":"Silicon Dreams","slug":"silicon-dreams","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/silicon-dreams","created_at":1450039261077,"updated_at":1515675730843,"summary":"Silicon Dreams is a trilogy of interactive fiction games developed by Level 9 Computing during the 1980s. The first game was Snowball, released during 1983, followed a year later by Return to Eden, and then by The Worm in Paradise during 1985. The next year they were vended together as the first, second and last of the Silicon Dreams. Early advertisements gave it the title of Silicon Dream, but it was pluralised later. \n \nAs most Level 9 games, the trilogy used an interpreted language termed A-code and was usable in all major types of home computer of the time, on either diskette or cassette. Level 9 self-published each game separately, but the combination was published by Telecomsoft, which sold it in the United States with the tradename Firebird and in Europe with the tradename Rainbird. \n \nThe trilogy is set in a not too-distant future when humans have started colonising space. For the first two instalments the player has the role of Kim Kimberly, an undercover agent, whose goal in Snowball is to save the colonist's spacecraft from crashing into a star, and in Return to Eden to stop the defence system at the destination planet of Eden from destroying the craft. In The Worm in Paradise, the player, with the role of an unnamed citizen of Eden, must travel around the city of Enoch, learn its secrets, earn money and save the planet.","collection":2769,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[17469,13189,25222,27314,41895,25311,55803,22425,19448,51978],"tags":[18,268435487,536871130,536871939,536881499,1073741825,1073741829],"developers":[7784],"publishers":[7172],"category":3,"player_perspectives":[1,5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[218,1027,10587],"themes":[18],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[63,14,13,65,16,75,15,26,25,27],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":567907200000,"region":2,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vhn3rupriblugonrpkft.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vhn3rupriblugonrpkft","width":640,"height":892}}
