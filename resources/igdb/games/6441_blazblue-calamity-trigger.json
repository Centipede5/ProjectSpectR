The game was originally developed for Japanese arcades and later received console and PC ports. The game is a traditional 2D fighter where two characters participate in a duel.

attacks.","collection":828,"rating":80.88307048369289,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":73.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":77.1082019085131,"total_rating_count":17,"rating_count":11,"games":[6750,7364,9927,2933,14593,1244,36911,1223,27421,475],"tags":[1,17,18,268435460,268435489,536870973,536870990,536871019,536871082,536871123,536871138,536871208,536871213,536872009,536872070,536872205,536872211,536872406,536872477,536873021,536873455,536874398,536874745,536874810,536875046,536875062,536875073,536875157,536875178,536875196,536875198,536875199,536875214,536875274,536875281,536875298,536875358,536875406,536875420,536875453,536875491,536875523,536875531,536875590,536875695,536875767,536875781,536875798,536875802,536875870,536875895,536875902,536875934,536875941,536875944,536876266,536876306,536876352,536876471,536876487,536876695,536876703,536876762,536876819,536876820,536876823,536876833,536876834,536876842,536876850,536877007,536877012,536877375,536877394,536877405,536877416,536877419,536877453,536877620,536877628,536877780,536877987,536878192,536878269,536878299,536878393,536878609,536879812,536880272,536880327,536880777,536880809,536880865,536880924,536881364,536881581,536881831,536882390,536882449,536882461,536883458,1073741828],"developers":[1218],"publishers":[8944,2437,2103,1218,4091,4092],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[61,78,107,170,211,226,296,301,1097,1158,1293,1299,1494,1565,2109,2543,3486,3833,3898,4134,4150,4161,4245,4266,4284,4286,4287,4302,4362,4369,4386,4446,4494,4508,4541,4579,4611,4619,4678,4783,4855,4869,4886,4890,4958,4983,4990,5022,5029,5032,5354,5394,5440,5559,5575,5783,5791,5850,5907,5908,5911,5921,5922,5930,5938,6095,6100,6463,6482,6493,6504,6507,6541,6708,6716,6868,7075,7280,7357,7387,7481,7697,8900,9360,9415,9865,9897,9953,10012,10452,10669,10919,11478,11537,11549,12546],"themes":[1,17,18],"genres":[4,33],"first_release_date":1227052800000,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[52,6,9,38,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1270166400000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Apr-02","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1246320000000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Jun-30","y":2009,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1245888000000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Jun-25","y":2009,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1282780800000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Aug-26","y":2010,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1267056000000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Feb-25","y":2010,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1245888000000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Jun-25","y":2009,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1227052800000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Nov-19","y":2008,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1227139200000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Nov-20","y":2008,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1246320000000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Jun-30","y":2009,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1270166400000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Apr-02","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1268092800000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Mar-09","y":2010,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1283990400000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Sep-09","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1282262400000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Aug-20","y":2010,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1283385600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Sep-02","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1267660800000,"region":7,"human":"2010-Mar-04","y":2010,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1269561600000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Mar-26","y":2010,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1269561600000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Mar-26","y":2010,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1269475200000,"region":7,"human":"2010-Mar-25","y":2010,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"BlazBlue:

is a fighting game in which players control one of several 13th century characters from the City of Katugsuchi in one-on-one fight matches. Players punch, kick, and use special attacks against opponents until the other character's health meter is depleted. Each character has individualized special attacks, including sword swipes, gunfire, magic, and electrocution. Characters often react to injury by staggering back with a moan, groan, or strained breath. During fight sequences, some female characters' breasts jiggle, while other characters make sexually suggestive remarks (e.g., \"You're as bouncy as always, booby lady.\"). Suggestive moaning and slurping sounds can be heard briefly during one cutscene. A \"Gallery Mode\" includes still images of female characters\u2014in provocative poses\u2014wearing outfits that expose deep cleavage or barely cover their breasts. There are some silhouetted images of a character getting stabbed by a sword as black blood shoots from his body. The game also contains some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"a*s\") in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Violence in a sporting context - Mild bad language - Violence causing minor injury only\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/BlazBlue:_Calamity_Trigger"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/blazblue.wikia.com\/wiki\/BlazBlue:_Calamity_Trigger"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/263300"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/h2games.co.kr\/eng\/"}],"external":{"steam":"263300"}}
