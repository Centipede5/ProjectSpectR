It is a text-based game written in BASIC.\n\nThe user enters a pair of single-digit co-ordinates in the range from 0 to 9 which are the x,y coordinates to scan. If a mugwump is at that location then the user is alerted. Otherwise the user is told the distance from the scanned coordinates to each of the mugwumps that are yet to be found. The game ends after ten turns or when all of the mugwumps have been found.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471,1073741829],"game_engines":[257],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":102470400000,"platforms":[112],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":112,"date":102470400000,"human":"1973-Apr","y":1973,"m":4}]}
