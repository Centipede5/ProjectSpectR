{"id":9907,"name":"Omega Quintet","slug":"omega-quintet","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/omega-quintet","created_at":1429911213096,"updated_at":1534370266448,"summary":"Omega Quintet is a hybrid between an idol simulation game and a Japanese role-playing game for the PlayStation 4. The player plays as Takuto, the manager of the Verse Maidens, an idol group that use the power of song and dance to fight off a phenomenon called the \"Beep\" and save the world.","storyline":"Omega Quintet takes place in a world that is being damaged by a phenomenon known as the \u201cBeep,\u201d which has been degenerating the life of humankind by affecting their minds. The game's prominent characters are the \"Verse Maidens\", an idol group with the power to fight off the Beep. These powers are used to fight the Beep and save mankind, by giving them hope and dreams. The members of the Verse Maidens are Otoha, Kyoka, Kanadeko, Nene, and Aria. Otoha is new member of the Verse Maidens, who is hard worker who is always positive, but is also still growing and can be prone to making clumsy mistakes. Kyoka has a strong sense of responsibility who does her job as a Verse Maiden while caring for others, and also has a hard time expressing feelings. Kanadeko has an explosive personality and often makes decisions without thinking clearly, Nene is very timid and often nervous and weak-willed, whom often shies away and hides behind Kanadeko, and Aria, whom is the eldest member of the Verse Maidens, whom is mysterious and tends to distance herself with her speech and behavior. Other characters include Takuto, protagonist of Omega Quintet, described as a positive guy whom acts as the Verse Maidens' manager and bodyguard, Momoka, a veteran Verse Maiden, Ayumi, Momoka's manager, Shiori, Kyoka's coach, Godou, the leader of the neighbourhood watch, and Tomekichi, a fan of the Verse Maidens, and is the leader of one of the supporting fan groups.\n\nThe game features \"costume destruction\" in a manner similar to Senran Kagura, which happens when the girls get parts of their clothing torn off as a result of taking repeated damage from enemies. Another feature in the game is the \"PVS (Promotion Video System)\", which allows players to make their own dance video and custom live performances to their liking. This is done choosing over 150 dances for the characters. Omega Quintet lets players make light waves and effects using the PlayStation Move controller, and they can feature in the music video itself by using the PlayStation 4 camera. During the game's fights, its Voltage Gauge fills up when Takuto protects the idols when the player attacks the enemies. When it rises to a certain point, the player can activate Live Mode, which gives the idols bonuses. The player must also adjust the turn order successfully, as team attacks are formed if characters act one after each other.","collection":3019,"rating":60,"popularity":7.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":66.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":63.33333333333335,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":0,"games":[27092,55092,26765,25921,18398,76397,29348,36926,26951,80916],"tags":[268435468,268435471,268435487,536871208,536871433,536871529,536871938,536872070,536872452,536874916,536875695,536876940,1073741826],"developers":[5322],"publishers":[2932,2252,1956],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,521,617,1026,1158,1540,4004,4783,6028],"genres":[12,15,31],"first_release_date":1410998400000,"pulse_count":17,"platforms":[6,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1410998400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Sep-18","y":2014,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1513296000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-15","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1430179200000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Apr-28","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1430438400000,"region":1,"human":"2015-May-01","y":2015,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30aa\u30e1\u30ac\u30af\u30a4\u30f3\u30c6\u30c3\u30c8","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iibymxqj4kqhhdfsdygt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iibymxqj4kqhhdfsdygt","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lf2alabqw85x2kzl3yep.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lf2alabqw85x2kzl3yep","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qd9jns28ycwqztcs2ugo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qd9jns28ycwqztcs2ugo","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n0igv8yw8kz7zqfb2fqr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n0igv8yw8kz7zqfb2fqr","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lxm6bhsrpp4b6boaf0pc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lxm6bhsrpp4b6boaf0pc","width":960,"height":540}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"w24oBymO_A8"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"ZhvwlCDQ_m8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gdzcnmcyza8z2k2docfd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gdzcnmcyza8z2k2docfd","width":1199,"height":1500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a role-playing game in which players assume the roles of warriors battling an evil force.
