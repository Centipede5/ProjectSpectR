It was just the second video game based on World Championship Wrestling, and the first of two released to a handheld console. \n \nGameplay \n \nThere are two types of matches available: a set number of falls (best of one, three, or five) and a set time limit (five, ten, or fifteen minutes). Each wrestler has his unique special move along with punch, clothesline, bodyslam, suplex, dropkick, and cross body block. One can choose between a single match and an elimination match which runs the gauntlet of the remaining wrestlers. \nThrowing one's opponent out of the ring is possible, as is fighting outside of the ring. There is no ten-count while both wrestlers are outside of the ring, but one will start after one enters. \n[edit]Wrestlers \n \nThese wrestlers used in the game were considered to be the top-ranked superstars of the WCW as of 1993. They were Rick Rude, Ron Simmons, Steve Austin, Sting, Dustin Rhodes, Johnny B. Badd, Big Van Vader and former tag team duo The Steiner Brothers (who had left for the WWF but still appeared in the game anyway).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[4,14],"first_release_date":763084800000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":763084800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Mar-08","y":1994,"m":3}]}
