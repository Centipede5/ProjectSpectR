Like many other scrolling shooters, the game is set in outer space, where the player takes control of a small spaceship across several planets. The game is played with an eight-way joystick and two buttons (a shot and a bomb button) through five large levels and their bosses (which then loop forever, at higher difficulties).","storyline":"Taking place somewhere in space: an armada of Gidans, led by the evil Dogurava, is invading the planet Borogo aboard five gargantuan asteroids. After surviving an attack on an orbiting Borogo cargo barge, a pilot enters one remaining fighter and challenges the Gidans in a desperate attempt to quell the alien invasion and divert their asteroid fortresses in the process.","collection":3589,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[55038,68287,28029,36950,90099,10209,105269,103020,109627,306],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871882,536875158,536878036,536885414,1073741827],"developers":[2073],"publishers":[11739,817],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[166,970,4246,7124,14502],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[29,52,86],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":711936000000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jul-24","y":1992,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":629164800000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Dec-09","y":1989,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Tatsujin","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30bf\u30c4\u30b8\u30f3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xrgwh5oov82hhibzidaw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xrgwh5oov82hhibzidaw","width":1446,"height":2000}}
