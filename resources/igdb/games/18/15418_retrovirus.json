Retrovirus is being created by Cadenza Interactive, the indie studio behind the popular tower defense game  Sol Survivor. \n \nPlayers take command of an antivirus program, armed with the tools necessary to erase the virus\u2019 very existence from the system. Movement and exploration are core to the gameplay, and players are encouraged to adapt to the demands of a world where free flight is the norm. Of course, the virus is armed to fight back, and first person shooter combat features heavily as players test their level of comfort with movement within the machine environment. Each player is able to customize their antivirus program with different plugins, allowing for a variety of approaches to a given situation. \n \nThe Retrovirus single player campaign focuses on the core story of the game, with the player\u2019s goal being the eradication of the virus and the discovery of its origins. To defeat the virus, the player must solve puzzles, engage in dogfight-style combat, and explore the depths of the virtual world. \n \nRetrovirus also features multi-player modes, designed to engage players\u2019 social and competitive sides. Co-operative multi-player allows players to complete the campaign of the game with a friend, teaming up to restore the system to working order. Competitive multi-player will focus on the core of the six degrees of freedom shooter, hearkening back to the action-oriented shooters of the late 90\u2019s and early 00\u2019s.","rating":60,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[27314,29525,28029,10039,25311,64204,68287,7350,25300,17446],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435488,536871015,536871365,536871378,536872070,536872406,536875187,536875593,536876245,536879155,536881402,1073741825,1073741831],"developers":[7510],"publishers":[7510],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,7],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[103,453,466,1158,1494,4275,4681,5333,8243,10490],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,32],"first_release_date":1359590400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1359590400000,"human":"2013-Jan-31","y":2013,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gtcju5sw6voxwixtijnn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gtcju5sw6voxwixtijnn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vadoxbiyrmvi8yqcsoqs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vadoxbiyrmvi8yqcsoqs","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/thxstnrzivpntxlkz3ws.jpg","cloudinary_id":"thxstnrzivpntxlkz3ws","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cheoxoee8q1nvcequxj8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cheoxoee8q1nvcequxj8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/txg3gklbi8fty2t25une.jpg","cloudinary_id":"txg3gklbi8fty2t25une","width":570,"height":356}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"yOIAhQhBswo"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ye9ijfloq3hhhd3jebh4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ye9ijfloq3hhhd3jebh4","width":268,"height":268},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/cadenzainteractive.com\/games\/retrovirus\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/227800"}],"external":{"steam":"227800"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
