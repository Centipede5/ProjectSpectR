Your task is to revive Frankie, the monster who wants you at the top of the tower while you hunt around for the vital organs that will make his life complete. You need to find a pair of lungs, a pair of kidneys, a liver, a heart and of course a brain if you want to make a man of him. But make sure you use only quality spare parts, as some of the older items may cause a breakdown. \n \nIt won't be easy. The castle has many rooms, dungeons, dark corridors, crypts, graveyards and laboratories to explore (sixty screens in all). And who knows what may lurk behind those locked doors?","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,13189,76098,26914,12579,29525,44076,11296,28148,27266],"tags":[1,19,27,268435487,536871262,536872032,536875057,536875209,1073741826,1073741827],"publishers":[6537],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[350,1120,4145,4297],"themes":[1,19,27],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/igkrhxqusca9uyj0tq7f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"igkrhxqusca9uyj0tq7f","width":905,"height":1024}}
