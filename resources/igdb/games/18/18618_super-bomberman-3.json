It is the third game in the Bomberman series for the system. The game was released in Japan and the PAL region, but not in North America.","storyline":"This game scales back a lot of gameplay additions made in Bomberman '94 and Super Bomberman 2 and returns to the classic formula. As for multiplayer, the game adds a lot over the previous game by adding more characters, each representing a country of Earth (including one of the villains, Pretty Bomber, as France, which marks her first appearance as a non-enemy character). There are also new cutscenes for the Story mode, which centers around the resurrection of the Five Dastardly Bombers who were previously defeated in Super Bomberman 2, as White Bomber and Black Bomber adventure across various element themed stars in which the Five are causing havoc, under the rule of their creator, Bagular.\nThe overall animation graphics changed with the third installment; unlike Super Bomberman 1 and 2, the third sequel's graphics were simplified, which look similar to the graphics of the Bomberman games for the PC Engine, and most of the music in the game are remixed versions of previous older Bomberman soundtracks.","collection":549,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[75848,95340,25311,76731,27088,28794,78550,35994,79392,103210],"tags":[1,268435471,268435480,536875181,536875262,536875305,536875610,536876270,536876449,1073741827],"developers":[864],"publishers":[864],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[4269,4350,4393,4698,5358,5537],"themes":[1],"genres":[15,24],"first_release_date":799027200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":799027200000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Apr-28","y":1995,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":813715200000,"region":1,"human":"1995-Oct-15","y":1995,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iqmqp6bzyhlwdlq6mbsy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iqmqp6bzyhlwdlq6mbsy","width":640,"height":432},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d7smrmyxlqf1vtamjlxn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d7smrmyxlqf1vtamjlxn","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"sGHVCTLTk7U"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jcehyyujsaz3whh6mae8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jcehyyujsaz3whh6mae8","width":475,"height":347},"esrb":{"rating":1},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Bomberman_3"}]}
