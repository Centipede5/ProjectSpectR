It was never released in North America. Stick Hunter was the first actual ice hockey game created for a Nintendo gaming system. \n \nThe game was designed so that 1 player could play against the computer, or 2 players could play simultaneously against each other. The length of the periods and difficulty level could both be adjusted. \n \nPlaying as a character who has possession of the puck, the character could not only skate faster, but could only shoot the puck forward. So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate. \n \nAs in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[70576,36847,57656,45560,4395,48220,27407,71553,51069,12326],"tags":[268435470,536870956,536871745,536872219,536875234,536875473,536875475],"category":0,"keywords":[44,833,1307,4322,4561,4563],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":569462400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":569462400000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jan-18","y":1988,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kfwkbjqlm2y8d2kep2ek.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kfwkbjqlm2y8d2kep2ek","width":342,"height":484}}
