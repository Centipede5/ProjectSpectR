It supports up to four human players who can compete with each other in top-down arenas. Alternatively, one or two players can take on the story mode in its single-player or two-player cooperative modes. \n \nThe game has a comedic edge, true to its name, and concerns a quartet of kunoichi as they locate a stolen scroll. Each maze involves finding a way to the enemies, destroying them with shuriken bombs and then progressing to the next. The player(s) can also find power-up icons, which increase the strength and number of their shuriken bombs, or perform other useful feats like freezing all the enemies on-screen.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76098,51464,26848,18387,72373,36608,34919,65832,11588,16468],"tags":[1,27,536870973,536871262,536879786],"category":0,"keywords":[61,350,8874],"themes":[1,27],"first_release_date":796089600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":796089600000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Mar-25","y":1995,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lc1vvzewf8jfjnmrmvtk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lc1vvzewf8jfjnmrmvtk","width":638,"height":1154}}
