Despite being first-party software, it was never released outside of Japan. \n \nA two-disk adventure game, Shin Onigashima (or to give it its full title \"Famicom Mukashi Banashi: Shin Onigashima\", or \"Famicom Fairy Tales: New Oni Island\" thereabouts) was released in two parts: The first on September 4th 1987 and the second on September 20 1987. \n \nThe game is depicted like other adventure games for the system, such as Portopia or Hokkaido Serial Murders, though with a far gentler fairy tale presentation rather than a gritty crime thriller. The game's story is based on popular centuries-old Japanese folklore, such as the story of Momotaro and tales depicting the demonic Oni and their mischief. \n \nThe original characters created for this game would be later referenced by future Nintendo products with retrospective elements, such as Captain Rainbow or the Super Smash Bros series (SSB Brawl even had a remixed version of Shin Onigashima's music for the Ice Climbers stage).","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":562550400000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":562550400000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Oct-30","y":1987,"m":10}]}
