Sadly, the publisher (now defunct) pulled out towards the end of development and the game remained unreleased along with its plans for an Amstrad CPC conversion. Now on its 30th anniversary I'm making it available for anyone interested. \n \nWhile I don't have access to the original source code, I do have many of my original notes and have been working with the disassembly to prepare the game for release with a few tweaks and bug fixes. \n \nAs part of the downloads I've also made available scans of the basic and detailed instruction printouts from 1987, complete with the original spelling \/ grammatical errors!\"","popularity":1,"games":[28029,306,103298,90099,105269,68287,55038,109595,103281,103020],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,1073741827],"developers":[17056],"publishers":[17056],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":1543968000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[26],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":1543968000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Dec-05","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbw","width":794,"height":595},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbv","width":794,"height":596},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbu","width":794,"height":596}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"-04LrBsPOUQ"}],"websites":[{"category":15,"url":"https:\/\/cosmium.itch.io\/quadron"}]}
