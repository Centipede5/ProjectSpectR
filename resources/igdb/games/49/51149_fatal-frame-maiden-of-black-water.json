Zero: Black-Haired Shrine Maiden) in Japan and Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water in PAL regions, is a survival horror video game developed by Koei Tecmo and published by Nintendo for the Wii U. The fifth main entry in the Fatal Frame series, it was released in Japan in September 2014 and worldwide in October 2015. As with previous games in the series, players navigate areas filled with hostile ghosts which must be fought by taking photographs using the Camera Obscura, which is directly controlled using the Wii U gamepad. A post-endgame story featuring Ayane, a character from the company's Dead or Alive series, is also available featuring altered gameplay mechanics. The story, which is set on the fictional Hikami Mountain, focuses on three protagonists who are drawn into supernatural events revolving the area, including an ancient ritual to seal away Yomi, a malevolent force corrupting the surrounding spirits that is tied to the fate of the titular shrine maiden Ouse Kurosawa. \n \nPlanning for the game began in 2011, during the projection of the Wii remake of Crimson Butterfly. The game was first proposed by series co-creator Keisuke Kikuchi when he saw the Wii U hardware and the possibilities of the gamepad becoming the Camera Obscura. The game was a joint production effort between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo Software Planning & Development, with Kikuchi and fellow co-creator Makoto Shibata returning as to their respective posts of producer and director, together with staff from the previous series entry Mask of the Lunar Eclipse and developers new to the series. The cast went through several revisions during development, while the staff experimented with the capacities of the new hardware. As with previous games, it features a theme song by Tsuki Amano. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim for its use of the gamepad and dark atmosphere, while opinions were mixed on its story, portrayal of its female characters, and other aspects such as its pacing and controls.","rating":81,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":81,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[103312,78632,76747,37419,107926,86477,106987,87622,81249,76253],"tags":[1,268435487],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1445472000000,"platforms":[41],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1446163200000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Oct-30","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1445472000000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Oct-22","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1448150400000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Nov-22","y":2015,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water (Europe)","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vlpe149l2ywgapmwsa8o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlpe149l2ywgapmwsa8o","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xqstceuwodwgdv35n2xu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xqstceuwodwgdv35n2xu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vf3iojifs2crohwqbdjk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vf3iojifs2crohwqbdjk","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g0mpblhypfew6im61txz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g0mpblhypfew6im61txz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xymx8yrmikuvlp01hgrf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xymx8yrmikuvlp01hgrf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gs9hozp9gyo54npdaya5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gs9hozp9gyo54npdaya5","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fmrqpgjpysnhdoqkbmme.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fmrqpgjpysnhdoqkbmme","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qroylxm0hqkpjfc6wjuw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qroylxm0hqkpjfc6wjuw","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vlf6sx5xmni6kgxf4eif.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlf6sx5xmni6kgxf4eif","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q95psgu29xpvvxyjnmmg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q95psgu29xpvvxyjnmmg","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yfhg4ewrsiq6y7sgf4k1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yfhg4ewrsiq6y7sgf4k1","width":1200,"height":1628},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.nintendo.com\/games\/detail\/4qsfAA8PLHOmOdSgVaRPtG6GMX3OlhCr"}]}
