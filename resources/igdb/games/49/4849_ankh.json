The mummy punishes Assil by placing a death curse on him, and now he has 24 hours to remove the curse and save himself. Later in the game Assil meets the Arabian ambassador's daughter Thara, who is also a playable character. \n \nRequires a game patch which consists of an updated audio .dll file made for Vista to run on Windows Vista or Windows 7.","collection":4211,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":76,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":76,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[22425,65832,18623,6732,18167,25311,44076,26145,25222,25646],"tags":[1,22,27,268435465,268435469,268435487,536870962,536871262,536871277,536871333,536871939,536872010,536872060,536872205,536873863,536875054,536875140,536875232,536875291,536875637,536876694,536876898,536877874,536879692,536880840,536882190,536883137],"developers":[2172],"publishers":[12357],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[50,350,365,421,1027,1098,1148,1293,2951,4142,4228,4320,4379,4725,5782,5986,6962,8780,9928,11278,12225],"themes":[1,22,27],"genres":[9,13,31],"first_release_date":1138924800000,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1177977600000,"human":"2007-May-01","y":2007,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1166313600000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Dec-17","y":2006,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1156982400000,"region":2,"human":"2006-Aug-31","y":2006,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1138924800000,"region":1,"human":"2006-Feb-03","y":2006,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b8hw5hvvz4zru91usywz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b8hw5hvvz4zru91usywz","width":640,"height":921},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ankh_(video_game)"}]}
