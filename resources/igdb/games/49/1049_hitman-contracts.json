From first- and third-person perspectives, players use machine guns, shotguns, rifles, and explosives to complete mission objectives and kill human adversaries. Players can also employ stealth tactics (e.g., poisoning a character's food; strangling them with fiber wire) to eliminate adversaries at close range. Violent encounters are accompanied by realistic gunfire\/explosions and large blood-splatter\/pooling effects. Dead bodies incur additional damage if shot, and one sequence depicts a severed arm nearby a torture victim. Non-adversary characters can be injured\/killed at will, though this may negatively affect players' score. During one mission, players have the ability to electrocute a restrained character who screams in pain. Some scenes feature strippers\/prostitutes in revealing outfits (e.g., skimpy lingerie, pasties covering their nipples); other sequences portray women performing lap dances, caressing their chests and crotch areas, or gyrating against male characters. In some missions, characters can be observed smoking from opium pipes or snorting cocaine off nearby tables. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language - Glamorisation of crime","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.hitman.com"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hitman:_Contracts"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/hitman.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hitman:_Contracts"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/247430"}],"external":{"steam":"247430"}}
