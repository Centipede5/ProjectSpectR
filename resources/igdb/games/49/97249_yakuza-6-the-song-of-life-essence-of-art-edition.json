Fresh out of a three-year prison sentence, an older and weathered Kiryu comes to find out that his surrogate daughter, Haruka, has gone missing from the orphanage he looks after. The trail leads him to his old stomping grounds in Kamurocho, where he discovers that she has been struck by a car and now lies in a coma. To make matters worse, Kiryu learns that Haruka now has a son that he must look after. With baby in hand, Kiryu journeys to the seaside town of Onomichi, Hiroshima to unravel the truth about Haruka, her son, and a sinister secret that the Hiroshima yakuza are harboring.","collection":380,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":12527,"version_title":"Essence of Art Edition","games":[81249,76253,103312,31712,65445,76747,102584,37419,18225,103016],"tags":[1,38,268435470,268435481,268435487,536874146,536888206,1073741826],"developers":[14150],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3234,17294],"themes":[1,38],"genres":[14,25,31],"first_release_date":1481155200000,"platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1481155200000,"region":5,"human":"2016-Dec-08","y":2016,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1523923200000,"region":1,"human":"2018-Apr-17","y":2018,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1523923200000,"region":2,"human":"2018-Apr-17","y":2018,"m":4}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/et0jq0tz3ylkdn4thk3e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"et0jq0tz3ylkdn4thk3e","width":6000,"height":4000},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hutgjzl2ik2jq9w3s9vk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hutgjzl2ik2jq9w3s9vk","width":6000,"height":4000},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x2xjubczi75ptpwjj7zk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x2xjubczi75ptpwjj7zk","width":6000,"height":4000}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"VkMVQRijvd8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tckdxy6xvpud4h20s10n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tckdxy6xvpud4h20s10n","width":1355,"height":1895},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/ryugagotokuofficial"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ryugagotoku"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RyuStudio"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/ryu-ga-gotoku.com\/"}]}
