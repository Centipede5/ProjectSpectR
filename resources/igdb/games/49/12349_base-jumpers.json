In a 2D platform gaming style, players run up to the top of towers, trying to combine 3 letter pickups to collect plain daft bonuses (there were something like 500 different 3 letter combinations) and then jump off the building and base jump down the outside. The last player to avoid the sticky out bits of the building and successfully open their parachute before becoming pavement art wins the round.","popularity":1,"games":[55752,51485,1070,10039,24199,36868,1073,26848,19174,42611],"tags":[1,268435464,268435489,536872961,536875073,536875244,1073741828],"publishers":[7165],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[2049,4161,4332],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,33],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[114,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bolredn5dpefmo7tbg2e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bolredn5dpefmo7tbg2e","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/itd2y8dw0ct48stug4qn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"itd2y8dw0ct48stug4qn","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ivsx42n7kzpzi3gar58a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ivsx42n7kzpzi3gar58a","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/taqayngtmwb9b5vmsvnd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"taqayngtmwb9b5vmsvnd","width":630,"height":803}}
