{"id":8149,"name":"Kim Possible 3: Team Possible","slug":"kim-possible-3-team-possible","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/kim-possible-3-team-possible","created_at":1415318385788,"updated_at":1531208717188,"summary":"Kim and Ron team up to defeat Dr. Drakken, Shego, and other super villains from the series. The game places the player in the role of Kim or Ron. Throughout the game, both characters must work together to advance through the game, as Kim may not be able to reach an area that Ron can (and vice versa). The game can be played with two players over a link cable connection. If this is not available, the player can toggle each character. The other character has no AI and will not move when the player is not controlling him or her.","collection":2986,"franchise":489,"franchises":[489],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,21062,28856,9611,16326,3222,18182,57187,7344,2933],"tags":[1,268435464,268435466,536871200,536871213,536871557,536871878,536872010,536872064,536872098,536872617,536872961,536873192,536874706,536875054,536875057,536875069,536875073,536875075,536875081,536875082,536875151,536875419,536875480,536875701,536875761,536875822,536876522,536876630,536876852,536884021,1073741828],"developers":[1241],"publishers":[789],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[288,301,645,966,1098,1152,1186,1705,2049,2280,3794,4142,4145,4157,4161,4163,4169,4170,4239,4507,4568,4789,4849,4910,5610,5718,5940,13109],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,10],"first_release_date":1124582400000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1124582400000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Aug-21","y":2005,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zm1piile143wxpmdabgj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zm1piile143wxpmdabgj","width":960,"height":640},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k3mz5i9j3hdqftb42xpt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k3mz5i9j3hdqftb42xpt","width":275,"height":183},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cuetmkujtopdrh3ocmob.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cuetmkujtopdrh3ocmob","width":480,"height":320},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n6xzde4xrz2czdkhk6dz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n6xzde4xrz2czdkhk6dz","width":350,"height":233}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d7jzuzjlrhw6xnzhmsiw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d7jzuzjlrhw6xnzhmsiw","width":225,"height":225},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/kimpossible.wikia.com\/wiki\/Kim_Possible_3:_Team_Possible"}]}
