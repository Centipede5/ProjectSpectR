{"id":55149,"name":"Rune","slug":"rune--1","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/rune--1","created_at":1503952804175,"updated_at":1534301591460,"summary":"Rune is an open-world sandbox game set in a dangerous Norse universe where gods, beasts, and the last remaining humans struggle to survive. It was foretold that during Ragnarok, the gods would fall and the Nine Realms would be consumed by frost and fire. This was foretold\u2026but this is not what happened. The Nine Realms are frozen and crumbling under the weight of war while the gods live on. \n \nRune blends intense Action-RPG survival gameplay with savage PvP and PvE battles. As you journey to end Ragnarok, you\u2019ll fight gruesome undead Vikings in brutal melee combat, raid enemy structures, collect resources, and craft the most powerful weapons the realms have ever seen. You\u2019ll explore vast lands, build ships, sail through dangerous waters, and make sacrifices to your god in exchange for blessings to help you end Ragnarok. \n \nCooperative PvE multiplayer allows you to form clans with your friends to raid, loot, and end Ragnarok together. Or, engage in brutal PvP combat and destroy your enemy\u2019s base. Regardless of your chosen path, it is up to you to defeat giants, dragons, beasts, and the undead to end Ragnarok. It is only through the complete and utter destruction of Loki and his minions that the world will be reborn. \n \nAre you ready to take down a god?","storyline":"From birth, the children of the North hear tales of the end of the world. A battle so great the gods fall and the Nine Worlds are consumed by frost and fire. But these tales are false. The gods did not perish. \n \nFor seven years, the worlds have been devoured by death and destruction. Beasts, giants, and the undead wage war on all living creatures while the gods fail to end Ragnarok. Thor, with his mighty hammer, was powerless as ice and fire spread across the fields of Midgard. \n \nFreya, and her falcon suit, were unable to prevent the giants from destroying innocent villages. Hel\u2019s army was no match for the terrible beasts that crossed their path, and Asgard\u2019s most cunning god, Loki, couldn\u2019t outwit the onslaught of venomous beasts. \n \nNot even Odin, one of the wisest and most powerful gods, could stop Ragnarok from spreading like a plague through these once-fruitful lands. Soon, humanity will perish under the weight of the war. \n \nNow, mankind must rise and do what the gods could not. Ragnarok must end.","collection":2890,"hypes":3,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[81249,55038,54775,103282,90099,47823,36929,106987,103303,26879],"tags":[1,17,33,38,268435468,536871938,536872007,1073741826],"developers":[413],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1026,1095],"themes":[1,17,33,38],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1535760000000,"status":4,"pulse_count":21,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":1535760000000,"human":"2018-Sep","y":2018,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Rune: Ragnarok","comment":"original title"}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ZmyTqnThdOQ"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"XcEeDVc2jTo"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"1bViPhnt9Rk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mpcljpdrs1qhcjs4kwuc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mpcljpdrs1qhcjs4kwuc","width":1485,"height":534},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/821290\/Rune"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/playrune"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/play_rune"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/PlayRuneRagnarok"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/runeragnarok.com\/"}]}
