It's a hardcore atmospheric puzzle platformer, not just another Limbo. Nevertheless, this game will grab the attention of both hardcore gamers, as much as those who prefer casual gaming. The goal of the main character, a small pale-eyed kid, is to find her way out of dangerous grounds by mastering treacherous obstacles arising from the rigorous laws of physics. \n \nThe character is called Stephanie. She is just an ordinary girl from an ordinary town and the most ordinary family, with whom the most peculiar story happened. \nStephanie was crossing the bridge when a strong blast of wind threw her off the bridge to the dark waters of the river. The maelstrom carried her to a dreamlike world, from where she is to find her way home. \n \nThis changeable and enchanting fairy world captivates the character. Everything is strange and so different from the grey days of her hometown daily life. Changing constantly, the otherworld is teasing her, but she better be aware because it is as dangerous as it is beautiful. \n \nCharmed grounds bemuse the girl. It is a fairy tale to stay forever. But don\u2019t lose your mind and don\u2019t forget who you are and get lost in this mystical land forever, as home awaits. \n \nMain Features: \n- immersive, intense experience \n- unique physics-based puzzling design \n- superb ambient sound \n- simple yet dazzling visuals \n- simplistic style yet engaging content through it's simplicity \n- gorgeous worlds, forests, caves, lakes \n- relaxing ambience \n- beautiful art & vizualization \n- great immersion into atmosphere \n- smooth, fluid puzzle-based gameplay mechanics and unique visuals \n \nDreamlike Worlds's atmospheric environment will have you facing dangers around every corner and almost every step could lead Stephanie into a perfectly laid trap.
