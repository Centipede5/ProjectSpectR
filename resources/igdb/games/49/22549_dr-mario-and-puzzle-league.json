Though Dr. Mario has already been released on the GBA as a Classic NES Series title, the version included in the dual-pack is enhanced specifically for the Game Boy Advance hardware instead of a straight emulation of the original NES title. Puzzle League was originally brought to life as Tetris Attack, but then rebranded on the Game Boy Color as Pokemon Puzzle Challenge a few years back. The GBA version is also enhanced for the GBA's much more capable graphics hardware.","collection":603,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[25222,8197,47847,26223,60044,21910,14047,45638,3475,18167],"tags":[268435465,536871140,536871701,536871872,536872307,536873064,536873787,536875379,536876083,536876258,536880105],"category":0,"keywords":[228,789,960,1395,2152,2875,4467,5171,5346,9193],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1135728000000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1135728000000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Dec-28","y":2005,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jatf93yrzfkbcoarfz2u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jatf93yrzfkbcoarfz2u","width":640,"height":639},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
