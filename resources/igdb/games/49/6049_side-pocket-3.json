Like its predecessor, Side Pocket 2, it features the in-game likeness of a real-life professional pool player. In this case, it's JPBA member, Kyoko Sone.[4] \n \nUnlike the prior installments in the Side Pocket series, Side Pocket 3 renders the pool room environment with 3D polygons. In spite of this, the table can still be viewed in a traditional, top-down fashion. \n \nPlay modes consist of: story mode,[4] training mode, trick game mode,[4] and versus mode. Game variants include: eight ball, nine ball, rotation, 14.1 continuous, bowlliards, cutthroat, three ball, poker, pocket game, mitsudama, and yotsudama.","collection":865,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[79833,63218,63217,102805,63219,48635,48469,39507,46261,57868],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536870965,536872928,536875290,536875570,536875580,536876165,1073741827],"developers":[2678,2679],"publishers":[2678],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[20,53,2016,4378,4658,4668,5253],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":869184000000,"platforms":[32,7,24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1015027200000,"region":5,"human":"2002-Mar-02","y":2002,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":892684800000,"human":"1998-Apr-16","y":1998,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":869184000000,"human":"1997-Jul-18","y":1997,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8\uff13"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/icdwzsfumjnefl22kyn7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"icdwzsfumjnefl22kyn7","width":939,"height":941},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.kojimaproductions.jp\/"}]}
