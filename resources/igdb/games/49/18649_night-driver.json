The game is controlled with a single pedal for gas, a wheel for steering and a four-selection lever for gear shifting. The coin operated game had a choice of three difficulties, novice, pro, and expert, from which the player could choose at game start. The turns were sharper and more frequent on the more difficult tracks. As play progresses, the road gets narrower and more winding.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27378,76566,55192,87728,40470,15851,103020,103316,27553,86041],"tags":[1,268435466,268435489,536874115,536875069,536875242,536875564,536875870,536876596,536876718,536879193,1073741826],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3203,4157,4330,4652,4958,5684,5806,8281],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,33],"first_release_date":212976000000,"platforms":[52,59,15],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":52,"date":212976000000,"region":2,"human":"1976-Oct","y":1976,"m":10},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":283910400000,"region":2,"human":"1978","y":1978,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":220838400000,"region":2,"human":"1976","y":1976,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5s1c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5s1c","width":679,"height":473}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"aBFTzC2AEjw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sxomsdwz4xzwhh7rfort.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sxomsdwz4xzwhh7rfort","width":1000,"height":1370},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Night_Driver_(video_game)"}]}
