{"id":10949,"name":"Ys Origin","slug":"ys-origin","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/ys-origin","created_at":1433280773243,"updated_at":1544264311454,"summary":"700 years before the events of Ys I & II, the land of Ys was on the brink of destruction. Demons came in droves and forced the twin Goddesses who ruled the land to whisk their subjects away from the surface, into the safe embrace of the clouds. The demons were persistent, however, erecting a massive tower in pursuit. The battle that raged upon the ground had begun ascending for a second round up above. \nOne day, amidst this turmoil, the Goddesses stole away into the night, vanishing from Ys altogether. And there's only one place they could have gone: the Devil's Tower. \n \nA search party of knights and sorcerers was hastily formed and dispatched to the surface in hopes of retrieving these runaway deities. Among its members were apprentice knight Yunica Tovah and troubled sorcerer Hugo Fact. \n \nThis is their story. Or at least, it's how each of them remembers it. \n \nExpanding upon the gameplay elements introduced in Ys: The Ark of Napishtim and further developed in Ys: The Oath in Felghana, Ys Origin perfects the formula by adding different styles of play and new features never before seen in the Ys universe. Best described as an arcade-like platformer RPG with Metroidvania elements and a complex, multi-faceted narrative, Ys Origin is the perfect mix of action, exploration and story. Screen-filling bosses with complex AI, unique platforming elements, innovative puzzles and a deeply involving mystery await within the wildly varied confines of this classic Ys dungeon. \n \nCome see how long you can last in the Devil's Tower...","storyline":"\"Following a devastating demonic invasion, the twin Goddesses use their magic to bring the inhabitants of legendary Ys safely into the sky. While the demons work to construct Devil\u2019s Tower and reach the humans\u2019 new abode, the Goddesses disappear. As a mighty warrior or a cunning mage, you must seek the Goddesses in Devil\u2019s Tower. With your swordsmanship and spells, can you banish evil from the land of your ancestors?\"","collection":1126,"rating":80.7422750482261,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":79.625,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":80.18363752411305,"total_rating_count":16,"rating_count":7,"games":[15451,55092,68441,28168,22387,80916,47823,28309,25921,55038],"tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871139,536871208,536871257,536871433,536871938,536871945,536872070,536872406,536873065,536873066,536874916,536875062,536875063,536875300,536875329,536875331,536875449,536875453,536875472,536875523,536875680,536875822,536875830,536876199,536876286,536876475,536877238,536877303,536877380,536880243,536880316,536886252,536887613,536888666,536888933,536888934,1073741826],"developers":[2751],"publishers":[4501,2187,2751],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,227,296,345,521,1026,1033,1158,1494,2153,2154,4004,4150,4151,4388,4417,4419,4537,4541,4560,4611,4768,4910,4918,5287,5374,5563,6326,6391,6468,9331,9404,15340,16701,17754,18021,18022],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1166659200000,"pulse_count":18,"platforms":[45,6,46,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1523404800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Apr-11","y":2018,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1487635200000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Feb-21","y":2017,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1166659200000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Dec-21","y":2006,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1338422400000,"region":8,"human":"2012-May-31","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1487635200000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Feb-21","y":2017,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1487635200000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Feb-21","y":2017,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30a4\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30aa\u30ea\u30b8\u30f3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ve0h4v8zfjmt9swpfrxz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ve0h4v8zfjmt9swpfrxz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pqmjlrkseo5sartmzohn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pqmjlrkseo5sartmzohn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e2nakp0l0uudupmqry1g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e2nakp0l0uudupmqry1g","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q3cmcxslefv1ejtkjrbq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q3cmcxslefv1ejtkjrbq","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kfq9ooxzzyimbwfs8g1w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kfq9ooxzzyimbwfs8g1w","width":670,"height":352}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"RD1OVjHELTQ"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"iz3WLIoBTMQ"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"IXF_h_LcbPY"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"kRFATYk07N4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gw1z6bi7iypd4vfcphoz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gw1z6bi7iypd4vfcphoz","width":640,"height":907},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The game was rated PEGI 12 for the use of offensive language and mild violence towards human-like characters.
