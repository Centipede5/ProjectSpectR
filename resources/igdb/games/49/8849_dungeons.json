As players engage in frenetic hack-and-slash combat, injured heroes cry out in pain and emit large splashes of blood that stain the ground and surrounding walls. Some dungeon environments also contain large pools of blood.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/dungeons-game.com\/"}]}
