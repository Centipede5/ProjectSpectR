{"id":40549,"name":"Wit's","slug":"wits","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/wits","created_at":1498481110982,"updated_at":1512758608682,"summary":"The core gameplay of Wit's is very similar to the Light Cycles portion of the 1982 arcade game Tron by Bally Midway. The objective is to move your character around a rectangular play area and create a line behind you that the other player(s) will crash into. In addition to being able to move your character in the four cardinal directions, the player also has the ability to speed up and the chance to jump once per life, allowing you to potentially escape a dead end. The game can be played either solo against the computer or against up to three other human opponents. The goal is to achieve the most points, gained by surviving, or to make it through the game's increasingly difficult 99 rounds.","collection":4076,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23175,72331,47823,25300,36856,76098,28154,80377,65698,19931],"tags":[536871744,536871945,536875054,536876208],"category":0,"keywords":[832,1033,4142,5296],"first_release_date":612748800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":612748800000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Jun-02","y":1989,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hbansqnb6b0faohhqyga.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hbansqnb6b0faohhqyga","width":225,"height":161}}
