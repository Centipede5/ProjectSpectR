Left with no choice but to repel the attack, the Assassin defeated many of them, even killing a low-ranking captain before the attack was halted. \n \nAfterwards, tasked by Rashid ad-Din Sinan, the Mentor of the Levantine Assassins, Alta\u00efr was sent to find and retrieve a sacred object known as the Chalice, which was said to have the power to unite all the factions under one flag of whichever side possessed it, ending the Third Crusade in victory for either the Crusaders or the Saracens.
