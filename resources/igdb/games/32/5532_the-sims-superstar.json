It allows players to guide Sims to fame. It is one of the few expansion packs for the original game not to lend its theme to a later re-make for The Sims 2; however, its basic premise of accompanying a playable Sim to their workplace and guiding their actions throughout the working day was revisited in The Sims 2: Open for Business and The Sims 3: Ambitions, and the mechanics surrounding celebrities were reintroduced in The Sims 3: Late Night and The Sims 3: Showtime.","collection":61,"rating":77.2177039843618,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":73.6088519921809,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":6,"game":223,"games":[29173,55590,35463,31515,34823,9789,18425,55689,13200,26553],"tags":[31,268435469,268435471,536870955,536871441,536871470,536871906,536872060,536872074,536872626,536872860,536873186,536873187,536873188,536873189,536873190,536874694,536875264,536875361,536875464,536875525,536875832,536879696,536880673,536880847,536886180,1073741827],"developers":[284],"publishers":[1],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[43,529,558,994,1148,1162,1714,1948,2274,2275,2276,2277,2278,3782,4352,4449,4552,4613,4920,8784,9761,9935,15268],"themes":[31],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":1047686400000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1047686400000,"region":2,"human":"2003-Mar-15","y":2003,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1047686400000,"region":2,"human":"2003-Mar-15","y":2003,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bxfa1hifd83c62yjvoby.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bxfa1hifd83c62yjvoby","width":250,"height":355},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
