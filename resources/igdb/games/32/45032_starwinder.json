This isn't an ordinary race, however -- an unknown alien race built magnificent rails\/tracks throughout the confines of space. Spanning thousands of miles in length, rails act in such a way that when pilots navigate toward one, it increases the speed of the ship. \n \nAs Conner, your overall objective is to bring home the ultimate reward -- the globe-like Starsphere. While your mission sounds fairly basic, it won't be easy; there are seven other pilots vying for the same prize. Residing in the far reaches of the Milky Way, competition includes a half man\/half machine humanoid named Ko-Axe, the vengeful Tianna Stone, and an overconfident egomaniac that goes by the name of Dextor -- The Terrible. There are also drone pilots that fill in the rest of the playing field. \n \nBroken into quadrants, there are 44 different rails\/tracks in which to race on; there are ten races per quadrant. While the bulk of the game is played against computer-controlled opposition, there are times when you'll race against the clock in a true test of speed and accuracy. Prove yourself worthy and you'll race against an elite group of pilots through Epsilon Indi -- the final railway. If you manage to win this final race, the Starsphere is as good as yours!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,18699,28029,45482,40164,22018,20250,76246,19341,32902],"tags":[268435461,268435466],"category":0,"genres":[5,10],"first_release_date":849398400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":849398400000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Dec-01","y":1996,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cwptukn08u47smmlryac.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cwptukn08u47smmlryac","width":1000,"height":996}}
