Skunny apparently found a map on one of his recent adventures and now must seek out treasure in six locations around the world. In addition to the health bar, Skunny now has a time meter, though how much time is actually left is unclear. Skunny must collect 100 keys in each level in order to go through the exit, and also gets an extra life when he collects 100 coins. Skunny can still jump on bad guys and be killed instantly by spikes, but most of the gameplay seems to revolve around jumping into cannon-like barrels and timing when to shoot out of them. There are 6 worlds in this game, with only the first world playable in the shareware version.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":815184000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":815184000000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Nov-01","y":1995,"m":11}]}
