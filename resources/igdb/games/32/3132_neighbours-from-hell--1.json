{"id":3132,"name":"Neighbours from Hell","slug":"neighbours-from-hell--1","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/neighbours-from-hell--1","created_at":1383833807364,"updated_at":1547502402414,"summary":"Each level's goal is to play some crude tricks on your neighbor by using every item near your character. Each stage has 4 or 5 zones (Not including the training stages). You must move Woody from zone to zone, The Neighbor moves with them as time goes by. Sometimes you can distract him with different ways (such as call him to make him go downstairs) or he gets distracted automatically (For example, painting, washing clothes, and so on.) He has pets watching over him, such as a parrot named Chilli. The game starts with only few rooms (the hall,bathroom,kitchen and the living room), but as the game progresses, more rooms are unlocked (in Season 2 is the balcony and bedroom, and in Season 3 is the basement and study),making the game more difficult","storyline":"Woody is an average man who has a happy life, until his neighbor Mr. Rottweiler, makes his life miserable. Woody decides to take full revenge on Mr. Rottweiler. In the game Neighbors from Hell, the player creeps around the neighbour\u2019s house performing tricks upon the unsuspecting resident. The player is the star of a new TV show with the same name, with cameras that track every move as the player sets traps such as sawing the chair, banana peels\/soap on the floor, smeared paintings and messing with home equipment. The game's objectives are to create disarray, increase ratings, and win awards. Obstacles in the game include the watchful neighbour himself, also - his guard dog, and a parrot called Chilli, both of whom will try to alert the Neighbour of Woody's presence.","collection":1410,"rating":76.7704881371784,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":72,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":74.3852440685892,"total_rating_count":38,"rating_count":36,"games":[76397,35994,26553,27092,7615,55036,103232,25311,29173,32510],"tags":[268435471,268435487,536871939,536874694,536875257,536875531,536876237,536880294,536882498,1073741828],"developers":[270],"publishers":[338,270],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1027,3782,4345,4619,5325,9382,11586],"genres":[15,31],"first_release_date":1056067200000,"platforms":[6,11,21],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1056067200000,"human":"2003-Jun-20","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1109894400000,"human":"2005-Mar-04","y":2005,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1109894400000,"human":"2005-Mar-04","y":2005,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Neighbours from Hell","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/srt1mzsznqq1xvurrecu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"srt1mzsznqq1xvurrecu","width":2067,"height":1615},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xom8s1n3zntckas6z05z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xom8s1n3zntckas6z05z","width":1887,"height":979},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dsfmwpohquswdgyepz9c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dsfmwpohquswdgyepz9c","width":450,"height":338},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/htrbxcgnmd0ok1c306hf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"htrbxcgnmd0ok1c306hf","width":450,"height":338},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vyfppp6wuetdryjlwj8i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vyfppp6wuetdryjlwj8i","width":450,"height":338}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ia3a4ub-W_4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xt4tp3cybwvwwakuhqyl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xt4tp3cybwvwwakuhqyl","width":256,"height":341},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/260750"}],"external":{"steam":"260750"}}
