The car comes complete with a speedometer (in kilometres), a lap counter, and a lap time counter. There are a pre-determined number of chances to complete the game, like in Super Mario Kart and F-Zero. If the player is unable to defeat the game in those number of tries, then the player gets an automatic game over. A yellow smiley face shows up to track the performance of the driver. If it's smiling, then the player is winning. Otherwise, the player is losing the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[58785,40470,28856,67625,80441,73154,72624,71804,69092,68306],"tags":[268435466,536874337,536874650,536875069,536875117,536875271],"category":0,"keywords":[3425,3738,4157,4205,4359],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":801878400000,"region":5,"human":"1995-May-31","y":1995,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ziewcu2r39q9ryph0fo9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ziewcu2r39q9ryph0fo9","width":640,"height":446}}
