Tomorrow \u2013 no more. \nShaman said: \"Flaming Dew scorches the earth, wipes the life \u2013 soon.\" \nShaman said: \"Death remains here. Life awaits \u2013 somewhere.\" The tribe sets off. For the Big Pass. \n\nThe Tribe is a tactical hardcore runner comprised of resource management and environment interactions \u2013 all on the run. \n\nTribesmen make their way through the unfriendly wilds encountering a quick river, a herb, a human and a beast of various danger. You play around encounters, splitting and uniting the tribe, arming it properly, making sure your people are alive and your food is in stock. \n\nPlease mind the fact that this really is a RUNNER (of no sort you've ever seen, though) \u2013 there's no stopping till the sun drops and the run ends. \n\nThe runs are procedurally built and ruthless to new players, but eventually it all depends on the player's skill.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"tags":[1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[726,1780],"themes":[1],"genres":[31,32],"first_release_date":1472169600000,"platforms":[6,92,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1472169600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-26","y":2016,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1472169600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-26","y":2016,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1472169600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-26","y":2016,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1472169600000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Aug-26","y":2016,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g5isurcc7vchi8ofo0xp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g5isurcc7vchi8ofo0xp","width":1365,"height":767},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mwqqwgc1vrdhsowdydb0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mwqqwgc1vrdhsowdydb0","width":1365,"height":767},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vaqevmyciqksgmt6fwvo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vaqevmyciqksgmt6fwvo","width":1365,"height":767},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ukjevpjfzqkduiuceeng.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ukjevpjfzqkduiuceeng","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ywv5dys9rfg2vh7mcklg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ywv5dys9rfg2vh7mcklg","width":1365,"height":767}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"BV65vXU_ia0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/guclsnu3gx0knvntizxb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"guclsnu3gx0knvntizxb","width":1600,"height":900},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.thetribegame.com\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheTribeGame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheTribeGame"}]}
