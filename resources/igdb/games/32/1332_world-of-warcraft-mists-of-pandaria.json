Players can explore open-world environments, form alliances, and complete quests to \u201clevel up\u201d their character, gaining additional powers and improved weaponry along the way. Quest objectives sometimes involve using magic and\/or hand-to-hand combat to kill various creatures (e.g., giant monsters, ogres, trolls, woodland animals). Players are sometimes tasked with killing non-adversary characters, including human-like villagers. Damage is indicated by slashing sounds, gunfire, explosions, and depleted life meters; some attacks result in splashes of blood and\/or creatures bursting into small red chunks. During the course of the game, players' character can consume wine, mead, and other alcoholic beverages; drinking too much results in erratic movements and blurred screen effects. Some of the dialogue includes suggestive remarks\/innuendo (e.g., a \u201cflirt\u201d command prompting the response, \u201cIs that a mana wyrm in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\u201d from a female character). A handful of quests depict animal droppings or involve searching for lost items in a creature's excrement. The words \u201ca*s,\u201d\u201cb*tch,\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d occasionally appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/us.battle.net\/wow\/en\/game\/mists-of-pandaria\/"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_of_Warcraft:_Mists_of_Pandaria"}]}
