The player maneuvers with 360 degrees of flight control through 6 unique levels. \n \nTake to the skies over desert and volcanic planets, through ancient castles and towers, and against massive airships in WarHawk. As a member of the Strikeforce Omicron, your goal is to wipe out the aggressive forces of Kreel.
