{"id":9532,"name":"Urban Terror","slug":"urban-terror","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/urban-terror","created_at":1428757682422,"updated_at":1526545964907,"summary":"Urban Terror, commonly abbreviated as UrT, is a freeware multi-player first person shooter game developed by FrozenSand. Originally a total conversion of id Software's Quake III Arena, FrozenSand released Urban Terror as a free standalone game in 2007 utilizing ioquake3 as an engine. Although the ioquake3 project uses id Software's id Tech 3 engine under GPL license, Urban Terror's assets and code are closed source.\n\nUrban Terror is billed by FrozenSand as a \"Hollywood tactical shooter.\" It blends elements from games such as Quake III Arena, Unreal Tournament and Counter-Strike. The realism in the mod is introduced through a number of changes:\n\nThe number of weapons and other gear that can be carried is limited. Damage is also more realistic than in Quake III Arena, based on dividing the player target into discrete areas. Depending on the map being played, external environments are realistic and can include weather effects such as rain or snow. Weather effects can also be controlled by game variables via administrator privileges.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103301,103298,103281,105049,27270,76747,32902,28029,95308,76253],"tags":[1,268435461,1073741825],"developers":[5108],"game_engines":[202],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[2],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":965433600000,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":965433600000,"human":"2000-Aug-05","y":2000,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":965433600000,"human":"2000-Aug-05","y":2000,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":965433600000,"human":"2000-Aug-05","y":2000,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"UrT","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w7pfeufahvovanoi5edm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w7pfeufahvovanoi5edm","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gopsf07ewvmxx6tbk6wq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gopsf07ewvmxx6tbk6wq","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/htpuafftyv0nboijw7cq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"htpuafftyv0nboijw7cq","width":1024,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"I-1m35C2zzQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bfdawohrfiddss8ufl52.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bfdawohrfiddss8ufl52","width":200,"height":200},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.urbanterror.info\/home\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Urban_Terror"}]}
