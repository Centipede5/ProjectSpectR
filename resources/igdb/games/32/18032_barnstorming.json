{"id":18032,"name":"Barnstorming","slug":"barnstorming","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/barnstorming","created_at":1455744803317,"updated_at":1546470079519,"summary":"The player must pilot a biplane through a series of barns in the shortest time possible while dodging windmills, weather vanes, and geese. Bumping into anything slows down the plane for a couple of seconds, increasing the overall time. There are four levels of play determined by the game select switch. Game 1 is Hedge Hopper (10 barns), game 2 is Crop Duster (15 barns), game 3 is Stunt Pilot (15 barns), and game 4 is Flying Ace (25 barns). In the first three games, the course layout of barns, windmills, and even geese do not change, making it easy to memorize the layout. Game 4 is the only game with a random course.","popularity":2,"games":[27378,14758,76566,55192,57187,87728,15851,76253,103316,44178],"tags":[1,268435466,268435489,536871904,536873540,536873753,536875069,536876282,536881812,1073741828],"developers":[66],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[992,2628,2841,4157,5370,10900],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vM9D_hNQNj8"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"1omwJegOAH8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l1q1v9ofrinqmzh9bjau.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l1q1v9ofrinqmzh9bjau","width":800,"height":1099},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UChsnFvwoAiVKTXXGf7O3hBQ"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barnstorming_(video_game)"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/videogamehistory.wikia.com\/wiki\/Barnstorming"}]}
