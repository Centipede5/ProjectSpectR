Using the keypad, players enter the number of the panels they wish to reveal. If the images behind the two panels match, the panels are removed and the player scores 1 or 2 points, depending on what difficulty the switch is set to, along with an extra turn. \n \nThe game has a total of eight variations, four each for each matrix size and four have wild cards. Each matrix can be played by either a single player or by two players taking turns; in single-player games, the player attempts to clear the matrix with as few incorrect matches as possible. Also, players can enable wild cards that will match any image on the board.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[82],"publishers":[82],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":283910400000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":283910400000,"human":"1978","y":1978,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"j7zgLP-A4lc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gjdnmnguio2umao9fmxo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gjdnmnguio2umao9fmxo","width":256,"height":351}}
