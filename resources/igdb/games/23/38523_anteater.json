{"id":38523,"name":"Anteater","slug":"anteater","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/anteater","created_at":1497974680036,"updated_at":1536761972873,"summary":"The player controls an anteater that elongates his proboscis through maze-like anthills eating ants. The player can only eat ants with the tip of the anteater's proboscis. If an ant bites your proboscis at any other location you lose a life. Pressing the second button will quickly retract the anteater's proboscis. Worms will not harm you unless eaten head first, in which case you lose a life. Worms can be safely eaten from behind. Eating queen ants at the very bottom of the nest will temporarily clear all ants and worms from the screen. Once the sun has travelled across the screen and night falls, a spider will appear. The spider climbs down the anteater's proboscis, taking a life if it touches the tip. The object is to eat all of the larvae before time runs out, clearing the screen. Each larva is worth 10 points. Each ant is worth 100 points, while eating a worm is worth 200 and multiplies the score you receive from eating ants by 1x (Ex. eating 5 ants +2 worms = 500 x 2 = 1000). Queen ants are worth 1,000.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[60044,90108,95340,106859,24426,25222,20329,25646,55173,25311],"tags":[1,268435465,268435471,536873787],"category":0,"keywords":[2875],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":381369600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":381369600000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Feb-01","y":1982,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/brbpszx5mrnsvfyudnoh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"brbpszx5mrnsvfyudnoh","width":148,"height":222}}
