Post statuses, create something, anything!\nSometimes enough, a post or some what is made and connects with a story that just doesn't rely on It's main cover.\n\nTHREAD Is a story game you must uncover yourself. It has a small purpose, and that's for you to own. The game is about ready for release, and waiting for beta testing. If you are interested, let me know here.\n\nTHREAD was developed in less than a week, but has a short game experience, and also has a piece of mind to POV. I've always wanted to create a game about peoples reactions, and just to see people reacting to a story I wrote just makes me think.","storyline":"In the game, you discover a storyline by using the programs discovered! Easily enough, these stories rely on you're search.","popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[13189,25222,25646,236,27725,18011,26710,26239,11261,11296],"tags":[268435458,536871169,536872032,536873850,1073741825],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[257,1120,2938],"genres":[2],"status":2,"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ctct2j0jjvgkp562f2wl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctct2j0jjvgkp562f2wl","width":1260,"height":712}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o60bnfr870dk5utsk0a5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o60bnfr870dk5utsk0a5","width":1228,"height":612},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/gamejolt.com\/games\/t-h-r-e-a-d-a-game-about-online-post\/201837"}]}
