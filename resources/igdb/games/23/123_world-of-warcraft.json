Meanwhile, dwarves, gnomes and the ancient night elves pledged their loyalties to a reinvigorated Alliance, guided by the human kingdom of Stormwind. After Stormwind's king, Varian Wrynn, mysteriously disappeared, Highlord Bolvar Fordragon served as Regent but his service was marred by the manipulations and mind control of the black dragon Onyxia, who ruled in disguise as a human noblewoman.

Players complete quests in order to \"level up\" their characters, while gaining powers and better weapons\/armor\/accessories along the way. Quest objectives sometimes involve using magic and hand-to-hand combat to defeat various creatures, enemy soldiers, and occasionally other characters such as innocent villagers. Some attacks can result in splashes of red blood or small bursts of flesh and bone falling to the ground. Certain quests require the player to drink alcohol, resulting in the character's impaired vision (blurry screen, pink elephants) and movement. Players can interact with scantily clad characters, listen to provocative dialogue (e.g., \"Is that a mana wyrm in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?\"), or view sexually suggestive dance routines performed by elves and other player-characters. One quest requires players to search for specific creatures among a landscape covered with piles of brown feces. The words \"a*s,\"\"bastard,\" and \"b*tch\" can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/WorldofWarcraft"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/warcraft"},{"category":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/warcraft"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/warcraft"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/WorldofWarcraft.eu"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_of_Warcraft"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/wowwiki.wikia.com\/wiki\/World_of_Warcraft"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/worldofwarcraft.com"}]}
