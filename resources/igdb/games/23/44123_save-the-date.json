And so begins one of my weirder games. Save the Date is a game about a lot of things. Friendship. Stories. Hope. Destiny. And above all else, dinner. This is actually kind of hard. I know what I think the game is about, but the game is kind of weird and experimental, even by my standards, and I don\u2019t really want to say too much in advance. Probably best for people to play it without knowing what they\u2019re getting into. Featuring music from the fantastic Francisco Cerda, Save the Date is probably the single thing I have worked on that I am most proud of. But don\u2019t just take my word for it \u2013 sit down, clear about an hour from your schedule, and play it for yourself.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[12328,15830,11655,37092,11741,61771,7364,34124,25375,54443],"tags":[536872225,536876982,536878563,536880327,536881320],"category":0,"keywords":[1313,6070,7651,9415,10408],"first_release_date":1369612800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1379030400000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Sep-13","y":2013,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1369612800000,"region":8,"human":"2013-May-27","y":2013,"m":5}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"_l48mTOowfE"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gmrhe4zbn81f8i3ax0jp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gmrhe4zbn81f8i3ax0jp","width":256,"height":256},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/paperdino.com\/save-the-date\/"}]}
