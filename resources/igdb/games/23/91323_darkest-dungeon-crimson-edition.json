These slavering enemies and epic encounters will introduce new combat mechanics, testing the limits of your favorite strategies.\n\nAs the infestation grows and your roster begins to sicken, the Fanatic will emerge to roam the hallways, confusing friend and foe alike in his zealous quest to exterminate the Curse.\n\nThe odds are not completely stacked against you, however! A new playable hero class will be added alongside powerful new trinkets, town events, and a fresh way to expand and upgrade your Hamlet.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":8965,"version_title":"Crimson Edition","category":0,"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bmk3ittxxgrx4mzzbuxi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bmk3ittxxgrx4mzzbuxi","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ig9zdocvvcky9ansxmkw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ig9zdocvvcky9ansxmkw","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c2ccdssssxs8i85xvjhx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c2ccdssssxs8i85xvjhx","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gnkrqgjmsqlrpojzjd8m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gnkrqgjmsqlrpojzjd8m","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xir1jjmtg4gwpdv6leki.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xir1jjmtg4gwpdv6leki","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g1pmlpyy1fmjpdq5l8p9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g1pmlpyy1fmjpdq5l8p9","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vtyavz5nduseunxwvz2e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vtyavz5nduseunxwvz2e","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cvnlorw8t8mcede4ibqs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cvnlorw8t8mcede4ibqs","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gs9q8ye8fm8hc16drp60.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gs9q8ye8fm8hc16drp60","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wxlejhqz5kspd0ompx9j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wxlejhqz5kspd0ompx9j","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vriitf9nd3pwd0te5xif.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vriitf9nd3pwd0te5xif","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jvgwhlls0pcfhnptvzkz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jvgwhlls0pcfhnptvzkz","width":1920,"height":1080}],"esrb":{"synopsis":"May contain content inappropriate for children.","rating":5}}
