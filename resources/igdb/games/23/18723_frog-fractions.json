{"id":18723,"name":"Frog Fractions","slug":"frog-fractions","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/frog-fractions","created_at":1460343117726,"updated_at":1522963762107,"summary":"Frog Fractions is a 2012 browser game developed by Twinbeard Studios, a company composed primarily of founder Jim Crawford. The game, released on October 25, 2012, has been described as a spoof of the edutainment game genre. In the game, the player begins by controlling a frog to eat bugs and defend fruit. Later on, the player may spend points on upgrades to improve their frog's abilities. The game does not actually teach the player about fractions; the player's score is given in fractions, but no knowledge of them is necessary to play.","storyline":"Frog Fractions begins with a frog sitting on a lily pad. The player controls the frog, and must use its tongue to attack insects, while collecting and protecting fruit. The game later introduces upgrades that the player may purchase, including lock-on targeting, a cybernetic brain, and a flying dragon. When the player collects enough fruit, they can buy a warp drive, which lets them ride their dragon through an asteroid field to Bug Mars, where the player then battles an alien robot squid. The player is then sent to Bug Court, where they sign their work visa. The player then travels under the water below Bug Mars, while listening to a narrated history of the creation of boxing. At the end of the maze, the player activates a spaceship, and must complete a text adventure game to return to Bug Mars, where the game appears to end (actually fake credits). Upon returning, the player runs for president in a music simulator game. Regardless of how well they perform, they succeed in being elected president, and must complete a business simulator manufacturing bug pornography to unlock further upgrades. Once all required upgrades are collected the game concludes.The game takes about one hour to complete.","collection":3187,"rating":78.83959991492189,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":78.83959991492189,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":5,"games":[72373,19301,65832,16513,7046,9789,9655,3075,17354,1595],"tags":[18,27,34,268435461,268435463,268435469,268435488,536871018,536871208,536871244,536871262,536871291,536871446,536871581,536871859,536871882,536871906,536871937,536871970,536872010,536872060,536872407,536872419,536872435,536872611,536872840,536873021,536873023,536873249,536873308,536873350,536873516,536873590,536873671,536874706,536874813,536875046,536875049,536875064,536875088,536875096,536875172,536875199,536875265,536875309,536875315,536875322,536875326,536875356,536875394,536875456,536875525,536875545,536875695,536875852,536876020,536876121,536876387,536876571,536876720,536876737,536876767,536876915,536877031,536877141,536877406,536878077,536878468,536880235,536880383,536880661,1073741829,1073741826],"developers":[9534],"game_engines":[64],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[106,296,332,350,379,534,669,947,970,994,1025,1058,1098,1148,1495,1507,1523,1699,1928,2109,2111,2337,2396,2438,2604,2678,2759,3794,3901,4134,4137,4152,4176,4184,4260,4287,4353,4397,4403,4410,4414,4444,4482,4544,4613,4633,4783,4940,5108,5209,5475,5659,5808,5825,5855,6003,6119,6229,6494,7165,7556,9323,9471,9749],"themes":[18,27,34],"genres":[5,7,13,32],"first_release_date":1349395200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[82],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":82,"date":1351036800000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Oct-24","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":82,"date":1349395200000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Oct-05","y":2012,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dyuhhuiaoq7r7jsm11dt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dyuhhuiaoq7r7jsm11dt","width":400,"height":302},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dswctujf39mgmjrmmb70.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dswctujf39mgmjrmmb70","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"BQq_z1gxl-E"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h0cajaoces5jexk2ti1w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h0cajaoces5jexk2ti1w","width":250,"height":250},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Frog_Fractions"}]}
