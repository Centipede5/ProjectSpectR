There will be a string of eggs you have to guide to safety by shifting the position of pipes, walls and other devices through button presses. The default settings map the action buttons to the left CTRL and left ALT keys. Keep your eyes on those eggs and where they're at - you'll get bonus points if you don't lose a single egg to the horrors of gravity.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":444441600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":444441600000,"region":8,"human":"1984-Feb-01","y":1984,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b0caf9lcdboshhamnk80.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b0caf9lcdboshhamnk80","width":850,"height":1100}}
