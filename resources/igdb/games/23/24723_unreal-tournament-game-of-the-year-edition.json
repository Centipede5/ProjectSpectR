The second installment in the Unreal series, it was first published by GT Interactive in 1999 for Microsoft Windows, and later released on the PlayStation 2 by Infogrames, and on the Dreamcast by Secret Level. Players compete in a series of matches of various types, with the general aim of out-killing opponents. The PC version supports multiplayer online or over a local area network. Free expansion packs were released, some of which were bundled with a 2000 re-release: Unreal Tournament: Game of the Year Edition. \n \nThe game is based on the same technology that powered Unreal, but the design of Unreal Tournament shifted the series' focus to competitive multiplayer action. Development took 18 months, and the game was initially intended to be an expansion for Unreal. Unreal Tournament received critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the graphics, artificial intelligence and gameplay, although the console ports were noted for having limitations. The game won several awards, and remakes have been attempted by fans. The series has continued with the releases of sequels Unreal Tournament 2003 in 2002, Unreal Tournament 2004 in 2004, and Unreal Tournament 3 in 2007.","collection":156,"rating":91.4631910137917,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"total_rating":91.4631910137917,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":9,"version_parent":272,"version_title":"Game of the Year Edition","games":[28029,90099,103301,68287,103298,113362,306,105269,105049,103281],"tags":[1,18,268435461,1073741825],"developers":[168],"publishers":[168],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":972432000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":972432000000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Oct-25","y":2000,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hn3jyajrt2ppjemvmmln.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hn3jyajrt2ppjemvmmln","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ga303lknf2wzcuqkxkjm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ga303lknf2wzcuqkxkjm","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qwnjrodapjxlynko0vrj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qwnjrodapjxlynko0vrj","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lokn0rb62lxrevbihd3r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lokn0rb62lxrevbihd3r","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qsxe9cwfavg3qwvdd9ir.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qsxe9cwfavg3qwvdd9ir","width":800,"height":600}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c8bqgirpjrzsharavmvz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c8bqgirpjrzsharavmvz","width":423,"height":500},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.ut2004.com\/utgoty\/index.html"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/13240"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unreal_Tournament"}],"external":{"steam":"13240"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
