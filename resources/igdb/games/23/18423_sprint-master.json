The game is played with an overhead view of the racetrack, and the first of two players to race around the track for the required number of laps wins! Occasionally a bonus will appear in the roadway; collect these to increase the traction capabilities of your car or gain a temporary speed boost. Other obstacles, such as oil slicks, may also appear in the roadway which will cause you to lose control and speed. There is a total of nine different tracks with varying levels of difficulty to race on, and you can choose either blacktop, dirt, or ice for terrain.","collection":4117,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,36608,40470,55192,34919,78315,77742,76119,74758,74016],"tags":[1,268435466,536875069,1073741827],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[4157],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":599529600000,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a3ywinws21z4qfzbbktf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a3ywinws21z4qfzbbktf","width":600,"height":839}}
