The story is set after the episode ASUKA STRIKES!, with Shinji badly injured and suffering amnesia as the result of an Angel battle and needing to retrain (by sparring with Asuka in Unit-02) and having to defeat the Angel to regain his memories. The game features RPG elements and FMV clips for combat; most of the animation is original to 1st Impression (with the voices of the original Evangelion voice actors and some other content recycled from the TV series).","collection":4077,"franchise":866,"franchises":[866],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[37419,28309,62151,33269,35994,61616,78632,80916,81249,24426],"tags":[1,268435487,536871939,536875318,536878502,536879752,536880918],"category":0,"keywords":[1027,4406,7590,8840,10006],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":825638400000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":825638400000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Mar-01","y":1996,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Shinseiki Evangelion","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cg87xab4uuy5jazjzk86.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cg87xab4uuy5jazjzk86","width":500,"height":474}}
