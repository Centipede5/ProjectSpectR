Join the Dude as he ventures back into his former hometown embarking on a quest to find his lost dog. Not all is at it seems, as the once tranquil (relatively speaking) town and its citizens have been transformed in the wake of the nuclear destruction. \n \nDare to enter the varied Zones as you cross the Arid Desert, trek through the dense Rainy Foliage, freeze your nuts off in the Nuclear Winter, and roam under the Ashen Skies. Meet the many mysterious factions comprised of the towering, the miniature, the zombified, and everything in between and use your radiant people skills to attempt to ally yourself with their enigmatic leaders, ranging from former child stars to terrifying demonic udder-wielding beasts! Fierce Lawmen, crazed Bandits, deranged Doomsday Survivalists, and a phallic child's toy mascot await. Do whatever it takes to survive! Wait in lines! Use vending machines! Buy toilet paper! Journey to where it all began to rescue your loyal companion!","popularity":1,"game":3109,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":2,"themes":[1],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lpv7cgozoe9l6ziizlmg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lpv7cgozoe9l6ziizlmg","width":1533,"height":876}}
