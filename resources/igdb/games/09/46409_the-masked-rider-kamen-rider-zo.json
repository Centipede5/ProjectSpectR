The game centers around 10 battles of the film's 3 main characters. \n \nThe player watches the video and hits the correct direction or button at the right time to achieve success. The visual cues of the movie suggest the correct buttons. For example, when the Masked Rider punches, the player should press the Punch button. If he dodges left on screen, the player should press the left direction pad. Correct timing hits the enemy harder, lowering their health bar. Failure reduces the players health.","collection":3146,"popularity":1,"games":[19565,2558,3292,14763,34919,51464,16468,36608,51525,3285],"tags":[1,268435463,536870926,536873299,536875049,536875054,536875289,536875348,536875426,536876663,536876901,536880072],"category":0,"keywords":[14,2387,4137,4142,4377,4436,4514,5751,5989,9160],"themes":[1],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[78],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":78,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bumhgaeutjrqtzmu3irm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bumhgaeutjrqtzmu3irm","width":1539,"height":2156},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
