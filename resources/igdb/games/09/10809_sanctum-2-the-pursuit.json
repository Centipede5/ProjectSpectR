This expansion adds even more replayability through four completely new maps! Use two new towers, including the Mind-Control Spire that takes control of enemies and lets them fight for you!

They'll be all like \"NOO NOT THE BEEES!\"\n\nOf course, there are going to be new enemies as well, such as the Heavy Pup that's far more aggressive than it's older equivalent, and the flying Bliskeblaske, which you'll just have to see for yourself.\n\nFinally, you'll be getting seven new unlockable perks as well - for example, the Reinforcements perk has a chance to spawn Explorers with shields every time you kill an enemy!","collection":466,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"game":2108,"games":[25311,17130,105269,34823,9760,13200,13660,81141,78550,33603],"tags":[39,18,268435461,268435488,268435471,536870989,1073741825],"developers":[999],"publishers":[999],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[2,3],"keywords":[77],"themes":[18,39],"genres":[5,15,32],"first_release_date":1382659200000,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1382659200000,"human":"2013-Oct-25","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1382659200000,"human":"2013-Oct-25","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1382659200000,"human":"2013-Oct-25","y":2013,"m":10}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"6BIfAoSOvQQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dwbcp4uuykhjxo2vg93p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dwbcp4uuykhjxo2vg93p","width":230,"height":326}}
