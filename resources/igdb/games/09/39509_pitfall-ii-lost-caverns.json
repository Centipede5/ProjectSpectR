He can also climb up and down ladders and jump over open holes. He can also even swim across underground streams while avoiding electric eels. Pitfall Harry must also sometimes avoid falling rocks and other plummeting projectiles. \n \nThe caverns have different floors connected by ladders and are like a maze. Points are scored by collecting treasures.","collection":877,"popularity":1,"games":[55752,36868,28154,44980,26761,19174,117,37137,10039,21062],"tags":[268435464,536871049,536872961,536873064,536873327,536875042,536875073,536875081,536875150,536875621,536876718,536876808,536878481,536879765,536883615],"category":0,"keywords":[137,2049,2152,2415,4130,4161,4169,4238,4709,5806,5896,7569,8853,12703],"genres":[8],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pitfall II: Adventurer's Edition","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Pitfall 2: Lost Caverns","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Pitfall 2: Lost CavernsPitfall II: Adventurer's Edition","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hrhtwem90sbnqapeg1oj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hrhtwem90sbnqapeg1oj","width":850,"height":1112}}
