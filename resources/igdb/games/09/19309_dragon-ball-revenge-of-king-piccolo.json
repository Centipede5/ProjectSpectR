Players use \"energy blasts,\" sticks and staffs, and hand-to-hand combat (i.e., punching and kicking) to defeat an assortment of enemies (e.g., mercenary humans, enemy wolves, robots, and aliens). The fighting sequences employ several \"cartoony\" effects that mitigate the level of violence: \"tweety-bird\" sound effects, dizzy stars, and words like \"WHACK!\" and \"BANG!\" flashing on screen. A tournament mode involves more intense fighting as players battle one-on-one to drain each other's life meter. During the course of the game, players can find reward items in treasure chests, one of which is a cigar. The expletive \"hell\" can occasionally by heard in the dialogue.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Violence in a sporting context - Violence causing minor injury only","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Ball:_Revenge_of_King_Piccolo"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/dragonball.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dragon_Ball:_Revenge_of_King_Piccolo"}]}
