From a \u00be-overhead perspective, players control a princess and her friends as they hack and slash at fantastical creatures (e.g., skeletons, monsters, dragons). Characters mostly use swords, claws\/hands, or blasts of fire\/energy to defeat enemies. Enemies generally disappear into piles of coins. The game includes brief drug allusions and\/or innuendo in the dialogue: mushroom enemies that state, \"Ah may be high, but ah'll take ya on!\" and \"Ah've taken a bunch o' performance enhancers!\"; bees that state, \"Jus' take one hit! Ya'll feel great!\" and \"Ah'm gonn fly high as a kite!\" The word \u201csh*t\u201d appears in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game is rated PEGI 12 for infrequent use of mild language.
