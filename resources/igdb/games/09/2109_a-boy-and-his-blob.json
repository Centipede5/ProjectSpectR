During one sequence, players can enter a mechanical contraption that allows them to punch, jump on, or crush enemies. Blobs burst apart with a \"squishing\" sound effect when defeated.","rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Boy_and_His_Blob:_Trouble_on_Blobolonia"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Boy_and_His_Blob:_Trouble_on_Blobolonia"}]}
