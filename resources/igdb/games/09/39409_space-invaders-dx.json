Other names include: Space Invaders XL on the Nuon, Space Invaders \u200a'\u200b94 on the Game Boy and Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and Space Invaders 2000 and Space Invaders 1500 on two PlayStation re-releases. \nThe home releases feature variants of the two-player mode. \nThe Game Boy release was an update to the 1990 version of Space Invaders Part II. Extra options similar to Space Invaders DX are available when played via Nintendo's Super Game Boy. \nThe first PlayStation release lacked the two-player mode. Subsequent PlayStation re-releases in 1998 and 2001 restored it.
