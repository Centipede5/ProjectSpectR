These mini-games are accessed by taking a tour of the amusement park and visiting its various attractions, such as The Grandstand, Rides, Midway, Food Court, Petting Zoo, and so on. Alternatively, a separate mode allows to directly select and play the desired mini-game, without going through the entire carnival.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,25222,25646,236,27725,26239,51978,34218,26223,19289],"tags":[34,268435465,268435487,536871446,536875054],"category":0,"keywords":[534,4142],"themes":[34],"genres":[9,31],"first_release_date":1290124800000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1290124800000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Nov-19","y":2010,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p72pl6fcooqf8z1jvg8q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p72pl6fcooqf8z1jvg8q","width":350,"height":500}}
