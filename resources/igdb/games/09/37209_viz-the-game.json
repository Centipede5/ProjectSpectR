It is based on a British comic magazine VIZ which, like the game, features lots of crude humour and fart jokes. The player controls one of the 3 Viz characters - Johnny Fartpants, Buster Gonad, or Biffa Bacon. The race takes place in five different scrolling environments; country, town, building site, beach and a disco. During the race you have to dodge traps and other characters from the VIZ comics.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
