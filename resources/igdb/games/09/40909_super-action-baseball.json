The top part of the screen is reserved for keeping an eye on the bases. As the ball approaches, your player attempts to hit the ball with his bat to send it flying. A successful hit will result in your player having to run around the bases. Running is done with the \"wheel\" on the top of the Super Action Controllers. Stealing is also possible. \n \nFielding is simple, using the Super Action controllers, players have 4 buttons to correspond to each base. Thus the ball can be thrown at any of the bases instantly. \nBox art is fan made.","collection":4953,"popularity":1,"games":[41445,69398,67390,66208,66197,65284,64377,64044,62299,62275],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536882367],"category":0,"keywords":[20,11455],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":425865600000,"platforms":[68],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":68,"date":425865600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Jul-01","y":1983,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/litkaf9dodti9uykdonb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"litkaf9dodti9uykdonb","width":256,"height":192}}
