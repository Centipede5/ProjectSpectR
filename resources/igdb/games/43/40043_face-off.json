At the start of the game, the players can choose how many players their team has (three or five) - and in both modes, they will have to insert another coin at the end of each period to continue. This was also the first Namco game to feature Greek text; on the continuing screen, one of the players on the losing team says \"ODCH\" (\u039f\u0394\u03a7) as the ten-second timer counts down for another coin.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":599616000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":599616000000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Jan-01","y":1989,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/emkk2gh9nsgpstwaq810.jpg","cloudinary_id":"emkk2gh9nsgpstwaq810","width":1206,"height":850}}
