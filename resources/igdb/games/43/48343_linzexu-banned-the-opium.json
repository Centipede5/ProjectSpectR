China\u2019s military defeats in these wars forced its rulers to sign treaties opening many ports to foreign trade. As opium flooded the country despite imperial prohibitions, the court debated its response. On one side, officials concerned about the economic costs of the silver drain and the social costs of addiction argued for stricter prohibitions, aimed not only at Chinese consumers and dealers but also at the foreign importers. On the other side, a mercantile interest including southern coastal officials allied with local traders promoted legalization and taxation of the drug. \n \n \t \nAs opium flooded the country despite imperial prohibitions, the court debated its response.
