The game is intended to teach a third grade curriculum.\n\nSet in a retro-futuristic universe, the game concerns Polly Spark, the bratty daughter of an apparently very wealthy inventor, and her attempt to alter history so that her inane answers to a history quiz she failed will be correct. To do this, she sends twenty-five reprogrammed robots back in time and, with her father conveniently away on a business trip, she takes over Mystery Mountain, the literal \"mountain mansion\" where she and her father live. The goal of the game is to help Botley, the robot assigned to keep Polly under control, save the world by retrieving each of the twenty-five robots and bringing them back to the present.","collection":2275,"franchise":830,"franchises":[830],"popularity":3.666666666666667,"tags":[1073741825],"developers":[1078],"publishers":[1078],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[170,575,605,1304],"themes":[18,34],"genres":[9,26,31],"first_release_date":849484800000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":849484800000,"region":2,"human":"1996-Dec-02","y":1996,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":849484800000,"region":2,"human":"1996-Dec-02","y":1996,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"HQ-kS_GeSOI"}]}
