The scripting and animation is slower, enemies have only their front sprites and lack gory deaths when attacked by strong hits or weapons, and the frame rate is slower. \n \nAlthough all levels are present in this version and feature their correct layouts, their architecture details are somewhat simplified and there is some loss in overall lighting quality. This port is based on a beta version of the original PC version of Hexen as many gameplay tweaks are shared, such as the simpler level design and the Fighter's fists being weaker compared to other versions.","popularity":1,"version_parent":3512,"version_title":"PlayStation port","category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l6coc8g25qyh0fiv0ohb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l6coc8g25qyh0fiv0ohb","width":1287,"height":1302}}
