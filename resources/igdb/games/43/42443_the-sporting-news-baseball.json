There are only three stadiums to pick from; two are generic but the other is the baseball field from the movie Field of Dreams. \n \nThere are several modes such as exhibition games, All-Star Game, the Home Run Derby, and a pennant race. The gameplay is similar to other baseball games, certain buttons to swing the bat and bunting or selecting pitches.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[71935,69275,43856,5380,6685,46261,69398,67390,66208,66197],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536875054,536878341],"category":0,"keywords":[20,4142,7429],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vril8cw2rsuaiq4elecb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vril8cw2rsuaiq4elecb","width":2100,"height":1506}}
