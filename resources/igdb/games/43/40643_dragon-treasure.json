In the first screen, you run across a bridge, ducking and jumping over fireballs. Then, in the treasure room, you pick up the various treasures, avoiding the dragon's fireballs, and leave through the door you came in. Then you start again. Although Dragonfire is a novel game, it gets boring pretty quickly.","popularity":1,"category":0}
