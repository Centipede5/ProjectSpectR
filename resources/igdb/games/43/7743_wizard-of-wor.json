{"id":7743,"name":"Wizard of Wor","slug":"wizard-of-wor","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/wizard-of-wor","created_at":1411461216446,"updated_at":1546425669005,"summary":"Wizard of Wor is an action-oriented game for one or two players. The game takes the form of several maze-like dungeons infested with monsters. The players' characters, called Worriors, have to kill all the monsters. Player one has yellow Worriors, on the right, and player two has blue Worriors, on the left. In a two-player game, the players are also able to shoot each other's Worriors, earning bonus points and causing the other player to lose a life. Team-oriented players can successfully advance through the game by standing back-to-back (such as in a corner) and firing at anything that comes at them.","rating":77.8438883798457,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":77.8438883798457,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":5,"games":[95340,25633,103020,68287,30408,7291,14364,27092,36607,80916],"tags":[1,19,268435461,268435471,268435489,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871244,536871599,536871881,536871937,536872898,536876354,536876718,1073741827],"developers":[17188,8588],"publishers":[566,6427,9480,11163,9556],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[226,227,296,332,687,969,1025,1986,5442,5806],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[5,15,33],"first_release_date":347068800000,"platforms":[52,66,59,65,15,91],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":347068800000,"region":2,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":66,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":91,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The Incredible Wizard","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/klucfwafp3xopoxazefu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"klucfwafp3xopoxazefu","width":640,"height":408}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"srPdPw9VH2A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/czimxsv9ynr24u9ux0gx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"czimxsv9ynr24u9ux0gx","width":1000,"height":1368},"esrb":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC4CVopmaApa58m2ZU5Z4jDg"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wizard_of_Wor"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/gaming.wikia.com\/wiki\/Wizard_of_Wor"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":15,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2},{"platform":91,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2},{"platform":66,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2},{"platform":59,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2},{"platform":65,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2},{"platform":52,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2}]}
