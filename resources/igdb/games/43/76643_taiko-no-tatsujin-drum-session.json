Players earn points by accurately matching cues while on-screen characters perform activities (e.g., playing drums, inflating balloons). One game mode briefly depicts images of two human figures punching each other in slow-motion. The game contains instances of crude humor: a character costume that includes a golden \u201cpoo coil\u201d as a hat; a sequence in which players can set their drum beat to sound like flatulence.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game was rated PEGI 3.
