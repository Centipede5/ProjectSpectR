The game and developer made the news for being a rags to riches story. The game makes use of the iPhone's built in accelerometer, and involves the sliding of colored triangular tiles called \"trisms\" in order to make matches of three or more. As soon as a match is made, the tiles disappear and, depending on the direction in which the iPhone is tilted, the gaps left behind will be filled.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,60044,14047,26223,27266,54276,47651,19222,8197,25646],"tags":[268435465,536871878,536873787,536875350,536876915,1073741828],"developers":[12752],"publishers":[12752],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[966,2875,4438,6003],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1199059200000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":39,"date":1199059200000,"region":8,"human":"2007","y":2007,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ixzjln0wvuuzj4zeqltv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ixzjln0wvuuzj4zeqltv","width":320,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ggwsxhijl3pt6tribjwx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ggwsxhijl3pt6tribjwx","width":512,"height":512},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/app\/trism\/id284653044"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trism"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/trism.demiforce.com\/"}]}
