Buffy hunts loathsome legions through 16 twilit levels before confronting the ultimate evil in the form of the Darkhul King. This side-scroller is crammed with interactive environments -- a fancy phrase meaning you get to break lots of stuff, like doors, crates, spider webs, vases, benches and even stone walls.","collection":4336,"franchise":182,"franchises":[182],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,44076,71455,7329,13189,26914,28380,56873,29525,55028],"tags":[1,19,268435481,536871123,536871208,536871894,536872032,536875054,536875057,536875209,536875291,536876443,536876694,536877029,536879794,1073741826],"developers":[716],"publishers":[197],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[211,296,982,1120,4142,4145,4297,4379,5531,5782,6117,8882],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[25],"first_release_date":1056412800000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1056412800000,"human":"2003-Jun-24","y":2003,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yutkoohv7v4cdzf32rzw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yutkoohv7v4cdzf32rzw","width":250,"height":250},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
