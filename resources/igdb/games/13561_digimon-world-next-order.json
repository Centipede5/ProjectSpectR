As players explore the digital world, they interact with characters and raise Digimon creatures to help battle monsters in turn-based combat.

Battles are highlighted by smacking sounds, colorful light effects, and large explosions. The game contains some suggestive material: female characters in outfits that reveal moderate amounts of cleavage and\/or exposed buttocks; dialogue that states, \u201cStay away from me, you perv!\u201d During the course of the game, players encounter a monster that performs an attack in which pink swirls (i.e., \"cartoony\" feces) are thrown and smear players' screen.
