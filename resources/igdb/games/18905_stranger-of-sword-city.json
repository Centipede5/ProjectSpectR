As players explore dungeon-like environments, they engage in turn-based battles with fantastical enemies (e.g., goblins, demons, monsters, dragons). Players select combat moves from a menu screen; characters lose hit points and flash\/flicker when struck. Cutscenes also include instances of violence and blood: a female character lying in a pool of blood; a knight impaled by a lance. One scene depicts a creature being decapitated; some enemies appear as floating severed heads trailing small amounts of blood. Some female creatures are depicted with bare breasts (no nipples), and other characters are shown wearing low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage. During the course of the game, players learn about an in-game item called \u201cpoiney powder\u201d that is described as a narcotic with addictive qualities. The words \u201cb*tch,\u201d \u201ca*s,\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/409890"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/nisamerica.com\/games\/stranger-sword-city\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stranger_of_Sword_City"}],"external":{"steam":"409890"}}
