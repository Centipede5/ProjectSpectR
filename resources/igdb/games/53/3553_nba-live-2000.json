These teams could be used instantly, but to use the players as regular players (e.g. traded, played on regular NBA Teams) they needed to be unlocked. Along the series, some of the rosters were changed due to many reasons as Michael Jordan was on the 90's team through 2004.","collection":148,"franchise":16,"franchises":[16],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[30830,43861,44242,811,4029,4030,5950,4032,27744,103218],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536870970,536872060,536872078,536872352,536873274,536875138,536875186,536875488,536875525,536875749,536877459,536877463,536877466,536877475,536877478,536878111,536884031],"developers":[454],"publishers":[454,1],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[58,1148,1166,1440,2362,4226,4274,4576,4613,4837,6547,6551,6554,6563,6566,7199,13119],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":941328000000,"platforms":[4,7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":951350400000,"human":"2000-Feb-24","y":2000,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":941328000000,"human":"1999-Oct-31","y":1999,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jx2lyiqzpxkfd5mdsnbt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jx2lyiqzpxkfd5mdsnbt","width":220,"height":215},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3}}
