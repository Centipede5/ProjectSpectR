It is also a battlefield where those who believe \nin light face monsters that thrive in darkness. \nThe struggle centers on the control of crystals: \nsacred stones that are the fundamental source of all creation. \n \nThe monsters showed no mercy as they laid waste to \nbeautiful towns, ravaged the land, and polluted the streams and rivers of Vana'diel. \nBut the people united to seize victory from the jaws of the beastmen, earning themselves temporary respite from a life-and-death struggle. \n \nTwenty years have passed since the people's great victory. But now, even as the memories of battle have begun to fade, a new evil grows inside Vana'diel... \n \nAnd it hungers for the power of the crystals.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1210809600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1210809600000,"region":8,"human":"2008-May-15","y":2008,"m":5}]}
