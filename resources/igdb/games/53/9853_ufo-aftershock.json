{"id":9853,"name":"UFO: Aftershock","slug":"ufo-aftershock","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/ufo-aftershock","created_at":1429483244510,"updated_at":1540403093932,"summary":"UFO: Aftershock is a combination of tactical squad combat and global strategy that enhances and expands upon its prequel, UFO: Aftermath.\n\nIt is the year 2054. Fifty years after the disaster. Fifty years after the surface of Earth became uninhabitable. Retreating to the flying haven of the Laputa the remnants of humankind clung onto existence. Then a revolt against the increasingly rigid and corrupt human leadership of the Laputa escalated into a conflict that destroyed the colony. Now, the remaining survivors flee once again. Can they reclaim the Earth from the unknown forces that chased them into the skies?","storyline":"After the life support system on the Laputa (read=space station or city), the peoples of the Laputa revolted against the Human Council, who tried to silence their objections. Armed conflict was soon unavoidable and the Laputa was destroyed soon after its engines exploded. The few survivors, who barely made it out alive by escaping in space shuttles, find another deserted Laputa in space. This Laputa is equipped with a landing pod to Earth, rumored to be long lost. Now you lead the remaining survivors of the Laputa and re-establish contact with Earth and the mysteries within.","collection":1273,"rating":50,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":68,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":59,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":3,"games":[28182,27092,25311,7615,55038,76397,14464,34823,9472,9789],"tags":[18,268435467,268435468,268435471,536870915,536871644,536871938,536872647,536874694,536875151,536875361,536875531,536877679,536878505,536880356,536880360,536881001,1073741826],"publishers":[157],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3,732,1026,1735,3782,4239,4449,4619,6767,7593,9444,9448,10089],"themes":[18],"genres":[11,12,15],"first_release_date":1130198400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1130198400000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Oct-25","y":2005,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xa1sy1jaukg0sjzjlgzt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xa1sy1jaukg0sjzjlgzt","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ourvf0bhvyprcsgpkjrp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ourvf0bhvyprcsgpkjrp","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lw8nenfyoe6wtcg8lqqo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lw8nenfyoe6wtcg8lqqo","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bm11g3eimqm3tll4oclj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bm11g3eimqm3tll4oclj","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/exprx0qoukikmpcoqtav.jpg","cloudinary_id":"exprx0qoukikmpcoqtav","width":710,"height":533}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"SZ13KRVktjQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tr6x9cjmjwu1zwinxi6e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tr6x9cjmjwu1zwinxi6e","width":256,"height":363},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/289500"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.1cpublishing.eu\/game\/ufo-aftershock\/features"}],"external":{"steam":"289500"}}
