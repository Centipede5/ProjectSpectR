As players explore fantasy environments and interact with characters, they use swords and magical projectiles to defeat various creatures (e.g., dragons, wolves, dinosaurs, giant robots) and human-like enemies in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by slashing sounds, colorful light effects, and depleted health meters. Some cutscenes include other instances of violence: a god-like character getting impaled with a spear; a dragon getting slashed with a sword. Some environments depict blood splatter on the ground; in one cutscene, a character is depicted coughing up blood. A handful of female characters are dressed in skimpy outfits that reveal large amounts of jiggling cleavage, and one cutscene depicts a male character's exposed buttocks. As the game progresses, players can accept a quest (\u201cLosing the Taste for Alcohol\u201d) from a character who appears drunk (e.g., \u201cNelo Get drunk very quick. But Nelo loves drinking! So always get drunk and make big problem for buddies!\u201d and \u201cA drink . . . to shelebrate? *hic*\u201d). One cutscene depicts a man smoking a cigar. The words \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201chell\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/xenobladechronicles.nintendo.com"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/xenoblade.wikia.com\/wiki\/Xenoblade_Chronicles"}]}
