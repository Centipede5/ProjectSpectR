By flying over the top of the play field, you end up in an alternate universe. You travel back and forth defeating enemies until you reach a boss creature. On some occasions a worm hole will appear in the middle of the play field and you are taken to even stranger worlds.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":476064000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":476064000000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Feb-01","y":1985,"m":2}]}
