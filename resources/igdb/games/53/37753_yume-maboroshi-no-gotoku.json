It was developed by TOSE and published by Intec. \n \nYume Maboroshi no Gotoku (\"A Dreamlike Illusion\", roughly) is an RPG set in a version of Sengoku era Japan. It otherwise plays like a standard JRPG, with a turn-based system that uses large enemy sprites in the center of the screen a la Phantasy Star or Dragon Quest. \n \nThe game was one of two games ever published by Intec for the Super Famicom. They usually worked with the Turbo CD\/PCE-CD system. It was never localized into English or released outside of Japan.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[37088,16468,12632,13196,36534,18398,36792,19698,26163,28010],"tags":[17,22,268435468,536871938,536875067,536879800],"category":0,"keywords":[1026,4155,8888],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":756086400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":756086400000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Dec-17","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":758764800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Jan-17","y":1994,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/emar3gpkpqmqlvbx84ia.jpg","cloudinary_id":"emar3gpkpqmqlvbx84ia","width":164,"height":293}}
