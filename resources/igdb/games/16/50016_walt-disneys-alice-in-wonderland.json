In this single-player adventure, you'll guide Alice through over 20 levels in a crazy world that defies imagination. In a gameplay twist right out of the movie, Alice will have to shrink herself or grow to accomplish some level goals. You'll run into many familiar faces from the vintage tale as well, including the one responsible for getting Alice into this whole mess, the White Rabbit. Brightly-colored graphics move the story along in expected Disney quality. With new things to do in each level and a secret around every corner, ALICE IN WONDERLAND will keep you in new adventures for a long time. When it's time to stop playing, you can count on the game's built-in battery backup to save your progress until next time.","collection":2986,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,10039,36868,1070,19174,51485,26848,1073,19448,37094],"tags":[1,268435464,536872961,536875054,536875057,536875241,536875265,536875870,536880204,536882668],"category":0,"keywords":[2049,4142,4145,4329,4353,4958,9292,11756],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":973296000000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":973296000000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Nov-04","y":2000,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kzvkhsyix6bgfuxhymnj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kzvkhsyix6bgfuxhymnj","width":500,"height":498},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
