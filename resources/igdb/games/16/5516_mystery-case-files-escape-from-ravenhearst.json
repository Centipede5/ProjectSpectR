Very little of the manor has survived the holocaust ignited when the Detective disabled Charles Dalimar's immortality machine, but Emma Ravenhearst's ghost appears to him, warning him away, but promising to help if he proceeds.\nAfter inspecting the ruins as far as a nearby lighthouse and the back garden, the Master Detective is flung into an open grave bearing his (or her) own name by Victor Dalimar. After encountering Charles, the Master Detective sets to work on a steampunk recreation of scenes in Charles' insane life, which the Detective must now relive by solving one puzzle after another. Arriving in an underground antechamber, the Master Detective must watch as the four souls previously rescued from the manor: Emma, Rose Somerset, and her twin daughters Charlotte and Gwendolyn are re-imprisoned, and restored to living humans as each scene opens. The Detective must participate in recreating Charles's birth, abusive childhood, time of commitment to a mental institution, and the wedding he planned for himself and Emma.\nOnce the Detective has traveled through Charles's world, the final door opens (via Emma's chamber) to reveal a rudimentary mansion with a new immortality machine, powered by the life-forces of the kidnapped citizens of Blackpool. Sneaking past a jubilant Charles and Victor, the Master Detective deciphers clues from the enslaved prisoners to figure out how to shut down the machine, freeing Emma, Rose, Gwendolyn, and Charlotte and destroying the Dalimars once and for all.","collection":747,"rating":75.15711170963189,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":75.15711170963189,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":5,"games":[18011,56033,25646,13189,27266,21641,24426,25222,54678,26223],"tags":[19,268435465,268435487,536871208,536871939,536872032,536875429,536875889,1073741827,1073741825],"developers":[2452],"publishers":[2245],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,1027,1120,4517,4977],"themes":[19],"genres":[9,31],"first_release_date":1322697600000,"platforms":[6,39,14],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":1322697600000,"human":"2011-Dec","y":2011,"m":12},{"category":1,"platform":14,"date":1322697600000,"human":"2011-Dec","y":2011,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1364774400000,"human":"2013-Apr-01","y":2013,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MCF: Escape From Ravenhearst"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a1rtisucaglg6bdpyrdr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a1rtisucaglg6bdpyrdr","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kzlgoeeebmbg9pft6ugv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kzlgoeeebmbg9pft6ugv","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q5ysjacvp7sfhc2p0hfl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q5ysjacvp7sfhc2p0hfl","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/urnlbl2wmkfij8hkiiw0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"urnlbl2wmkfij8hkiiw0","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wjirs3nxsvobjtkgkspx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wjirs3nxsvobjtkgkspx","width":1280,"height":800}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vwjzi6lhpxpdwmplyg6z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vwjzi6lhpxpdwmplyg6z","width":250,"height":156},"esrb":{"rating":5},"external":{"steam":"438560"}}
