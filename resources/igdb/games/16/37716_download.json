The player, as cyber-diver Syd, must fly his hoverbike through the future city of Kabukicho to rescue his partner Deva from the corrupt police. \n \nOverview \nDownload is a horizontal shoot 'em up set in a dystopian cyberpunk future in which the main character, Syd, is haunted by memories of his friend Ohala falling to a cybernetic menace. Meanwhile, he receives a call from his contact\/partner Deva and must rush to her rescue when she is abducted by the Kabukicho police force. The game's story is depicted in a series of animated vignettes before each stage, similar to Ninja Gaiden. Beginning with the mean streets of Kabukicho, Syd will eventually jack into the internet and fights in a similar manner through cyberspace. \n \nDownload is perhaps best known for its profanity-laden game over messages. It was followed by a PC Engine CD sequel the following year: Download 2. \n \nGameplay \nSyd's hoverbike has variable loadouts that the player can assign at the start of each level. These weapons can be upgraded further by finding power-ups within the level. The chief weapon, which can be fired infinitely, include a focused laser weapon and a scattered beam shot: the former is best for bosses and stronger foes, while the latter can quickly eliminate large crowds of weaker enemies. The player will often need to play each level a few times to determine the best loadout. \n \nThe player can also select between three sub-weapons: chaser missiles, which home in on foes; crusher, which absorbs shots and causes explosions; and barrier, which stops shots for a short time. Each sub-weapon has a finite number of uses which can be replenished by finding the right power-ups.","popularity":1,"games":[10209,17130,55038,34823,68287,10212,1877,56353,13200,13660],"tags":[18,536870990,536871015,536871078,536871882],"category":0,"keywords":[78,103,166,970],"themes":[18],"first_release_date":646012800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":646012800000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Jun-22","y":1990,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/svukskjwdhoqegbplho6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"svukskjwdhoqegbplho6","width":396,"height":380}}
