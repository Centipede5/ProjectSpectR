While the original version from Atari is still a blast to play, Medieval Mayhem adds arcade features such as the launch dragon, multiple fireballs and a level of polish missing from the original 2600 release. It also includes a menu to select options before starting the game. Medieval Mayhem is a frenetic multi-player game that you can enjoy against your friends (up to four people may play) or against the computer AI!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1138752000000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":1138752000000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Feb-01","y":2006,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ieifnbebopdv1xs0cgmu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ieifnbebopdv1xs0cgmu","width":400,"height":490}}
