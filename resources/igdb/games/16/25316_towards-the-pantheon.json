{"id":25316,"name":"Towards The Pantheon","slug":"towards-the-pantheon","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/towards-the-pantheon","created_at":1477755760575,"updated_at":1528736477585,"summary":"For a thousand years the world has believed itself to be at peace. But behind the scenes, the forgotten group once known as The Terrorforce has reawakened and are using divide and conquer tactics to destabilize the world\u2019s economic, social, and political norms. Tensions are rising between the many races of the world but luckily a small number of people remember the past and are determined to not let history repeat itself. \n \nTowards The Pantheon is a 2D top down role-playing game in development where players journey through lush forests, freezing plains of snow, dystopian cyberpunk cities, and barren wastelands to find and defeat the source of The Terrorforce at The Pantheon. \n \nGone are the RPG clich\u00e9s of potions, wars between elemental gods, and the journey where someone accidentally stumbles upon a unique magical power that enables only them to save the world. Instead Towards The Pantheon is a unique and unusual game that follows the unlikely team of Freyja the warrior, Bam the cat, Mishima the cyborg, and Phenez the dead on their simultaneously lighthearted, fun, dark, and painful journey. \n \nDrawing inspiration from a variety of classics ranging from Paper Mario, Silent Hill, and Golden Sun, Towards The Pantheon is a personal game that is currently aiming for a Summer 2017 release. \n \nFeatures: \n \n- Ability to switch between the four main characters, each with unique overworld mechanics. \n- Turn based combat system where each character has unique battle mechanics. \n- A huge fully connected overworld with an additional transportation system. \n- More than 10 regions to explore including lush forests, freezing snow lands, cyberpunk cities, barren wastelands, and a desolate mansion. \n- Dialog and support systems that allow for further character development and stat boosts. \n- A full original soundtrack that combines modern production techniques with SNES\/GBC\/Genesis era synthesizers. The soundtrack will be released as both an Original Soundtrack (~70 minutes) and Complete Soundtrack (containing every song in the game). \n- A unique and complex overarching storyline that ties together over 5 races spanning over 10 regions, each contributing to a deep and rich lore.","hypes":1,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":55,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[25311,47823,3231,25921,23733,14760,102869,19448,36534,27092],"tags":[17,18,19,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435487,268435488,536870990,536871029,536871043,536871135,536871200,536871208,536871337,536871350,536871390,536871393,536871415,536871433,536872032,536872070,536872617,536873174,536873405,536873475,536873491,536873492,536873639,536873666,1073741827],"game_engines":[79],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,117,131,223,288,296,425,438,478,481,503,521,1120,1158,1705,2262,2493,2563,2579,2580,2727,2754],"themes":[17,18,19],"genres":[12,15,16,31,32],"first_release_date":1508889600000,"status":2,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1508889600000,"human":"2017-Oct-25","y":2017,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1508889600000,"human":"2017-Oct-25","y":2017,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1508889600000,"human":"2017-Oct-25","y":2017,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f57a0ue0qrsrnyiydxuk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f57a0ue0qrsrnyiydxuk","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jrnpysyirgcf8y2rzuka.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jrnpysyirgcf8y2rzuka","width":833,"height":521},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xuyzvdmvjytpjmptudma.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xuyzvdmvjytpjmptudma","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xj9pwcwdcbonrt5igzxa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xj9pwcwdcbonrt5igzxa","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fqu59pyatrlogd2jka9y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fqu59pyatrlogd2jka9y","width":1344,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"_8tQTkdZf2A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/di0cywjpo5obrldqulul.jpg","cloudinary_id":"di0cywjpo5obrldqulul","width":1080,"height":1920},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/709510"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.towardsthepantheon.com"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TowardsThePantheon\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PantheonDev"}],"external":{"steam":"709510"}}
