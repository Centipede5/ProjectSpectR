The player controls a party of heroes with an entire army under their control, and fights other armies and random encounters with monsters. To begin the game, the player must purchase and equip their army before setting out. \n \nThe game's battles play out in turn-based formations, and each formation acts separately and can target different formations on the enemy's side. For instance, the archers can aim for any of the four rows of enemy forces, though front-line melee fighters are far more limited.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55036,29173,932,55590,27092,23345,19376,39257,22258,12632],"tags":[268435471,536871208,536871938,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,3782],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":621475200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":621475200000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Sep-11","y":1989,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Melville's Flame","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c7umdlkgg1voenqkusjm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c7umdlkgg1voenqkusjm","width":372,"height":406}}
