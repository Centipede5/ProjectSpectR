Some dialogue contains sexual references (e.g., 'I had an image of a naked [character] wriggling around on it with a young journalist' and '\u2026one of the most infamous adulterers in Europe'), and there are occasional references to drugs (e.g., 'A young man who sought to join the sect was given hashish until he drifted into dreams' and 'The freshest water, the most delicious food and the choicest hash'). Expletives such as 'b*tch' and 'hell' sometimes appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Broken_Sword:_The_Shadow_of_the_Templars"}]}
