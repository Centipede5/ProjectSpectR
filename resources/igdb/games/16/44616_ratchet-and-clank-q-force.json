In an attempt to entertain Qwark, Clank suggests that there are some \"rogue\" cleaner bots in the engine room. After destroying the robots they're summoned to the bridge where a transmission from an enemy of Qwark comes in, explaining that several Planetary Defense Centers are going to be taken by Grungarian Marauders. In response to this threat Qwark reassembles the Q-Force.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[10039,28029,55038,76723,90099,103020,68287,36950,105269,95340],"tags":[1,18,27,268435461,268435464,536870979,536871974,536873029,536887985,536887986,536887987,536887988,536887989,1073741826,1073741825],"developers":[834],"publishers":[13634],"game_engines":[567],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2,3,4],"keywords":[67,1062,2117,17073,17074,17075,17076,17077],"themes":[1,18,27],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":1337558400000,"platforms":[46,9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1337817600000,"region":1,"human":"2012-May-24","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1338940800000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Jun-06","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1337644800000,"region":3,"human":"2012-May-22","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1337558400000,"region":2,"human":"2012-May-21","y":2012,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1356825600000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Dec-30","y":2012,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1356739200000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Dec-29","y":2012,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1356566400000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Dec-27","y":2012,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault ","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jgj9yyjimihphansfrul.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jgj9yyjimihphansfrul","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ebh4rl24oicobhnvzib7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ebh4rl24oicobhnvzib7","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t0mbrrdnbczyvmbqlqck.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t0mbrrdnbczyvmbqlqck","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"iR92hlIM3Og"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ZY1aeurQ2z4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/asapha4fncbf2m0acjyt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"asapha4fncbf2m0acjyt","width":1280,"height":1464},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":46,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":4},{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":4,"offlinemax":4}]}
