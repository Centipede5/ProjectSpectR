Agents from the lava-scarred planet Apokolips have come to Metropolis to humiliate Superman before the entire world, right in his own hometown. Enlisting the aid of local mob kingpin Bruno Mannheim, leader of the notorious Intergang, wicked emissary Kanto supplies the gang with out-of-this-world weaponry possessing the power to bring down Superman. While Superman is busy bringing the thugs of Intergang to justice, the beastlike Kalibak seizes the opportunity to abduct Lois and spirit her away to a remote, clandestine location.
