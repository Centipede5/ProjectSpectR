It displays a wireframe view (using vector graphics rather than raster graphics) on a horizontal black and white (with green and red sectioned color overlay) vector monitor. Due to its novel gameplay and look, this game was very popular for many years. Throughout the 1980s, Battlezone was ported to several home computer systems (usually on the Atarisoft label), including the Apple II, the Commodore 64, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, and the Atari XEGS. The Atari ST port contains large parts of the original 6502 code which is emulated in real time. An Atari 2600 port was also released, but has colored raster graphics due to limitations and the view is behind the tank rather than inside it.","collection":1706,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[14758,18088,68287,8422,28751,36950,27398,55038,17130,15443],"tags":[1,39,268435461,268435469,268435489,536870913,536871644,536871882,536871937,536872651,536872733,536873064,536873246,536873874,536875046,536875171,536875242,536875857,536876005,536876362,536880236,1073741825],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[9519,1121,190,2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,732,970,1025,1739,1821,2152,2334,2962,4134,4259,4330,4945,5093,5450,9324],"themes":[1,39],"genres":[5,13,33],"first_release_date":341884800000,"platforms":[71,52,63,59,13,65,75,15,26,61,33],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":61,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":33,"human":"TBD"},{"category":2,"platform":71,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":567907200000,"region":2,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":1,"platform":52,"date":341884800000,"region":2,"human":"1980-Nov","y":1980,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5s30.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5s30","width":675,"height":329}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"Ctr54kopo8I"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bpwq67kyaenmu1r8dt6e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bpwq67kyaenmu1r8dt6e","width":850,"height":1109},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCWpbna6nMpXfw6I3VlyqzGg"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/videogamehistory.wikia.com\/wiki\/Battlezone"}]}
