{"id":6816,"name":"Knights of the Round","slug":"knights-of-the-round","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/knights-of-the-round","created_at":1400395630237,"updated_at":1542512908369,"summary":"The gameplay is very similar to other Capcom beat 'em ups, such as Final Fight and Capcom's previous hack-and-slash fantasy title The King of Dragons. There are seven stages, each with its own boss and a variety of generic enemies that try to stop the players' progress. The fights rely strongly on blocking ability, which is triggered by pressing the attack button, then pressing the joystick away as the opponent strikes. If successful, the player gains a few seconds of invincibility with which to counter-attack. However, if no one strikes the player's character while holding the block, they will tire and drop their guard, making them vulnerable to attack. Blocking is vital in certain cases, since some bosses will be vulnerable only after their attack has been blocked by the player.\n\nAs in most beat 'em ups, a desperation attack is performed by pressing both the attack and jump buttons simultaneously. This knocks out most enemies on the screen, but the player loses a little bit of health every time he uses it.","storyline":"Arthur, who had been training himself to be a great knight, pulled out the sacred sword Excalibur from the rock. After pulling it out, Arthur realized his destiny was to become the first King of the Britons. Merlin then sends Arthur and his two closest companions, Lancelot and Perceval, to overthrow the evil king Garibaldi and to unite England.","rating":77.2640284538098,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":77.2640284538098,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":7,"games":[2933,14394,9611,1593,68441,44,3222,28168,103054,34155],"tags":[1,22,268435460,268435468,268435481,268435487,268435489,536870990,536871059,536871063,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871301,536871504,536871535,536871894,536871938,536871971,536872019,536872205,536872425,536873154,536873473,536873591,536874398,536874745,536874831,536874994,536875042,536875073,536875153,536875196,536875242,536875304,536875331,536875372,536875443,536875455,536875594,536875655,536875667,536875671,536875738,536875830,536875934,536876010,536876036,536876208,536876490,536876503,536876847,536877148,536877298,536877348,536877568,536878323,536878351,536880292,536883137,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[37],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[78,147,151,226,227,296,301,389,592,623,982,1026,1059,1107,1293,1513,2242,2561,2679,3486,3833,3919,4082,4130,4161,4241,4284,4330,4392,4419,4460,4531,4543,4682,4743,4755,4759,4826,4918,5022,5098,5124,5296,5578,5591,5935,6236,6386,6436,6656,7411,7439,9380,12225],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[4,12,25,31,33],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[52,19],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":19,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Students of the Round: The Eternal Legend","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cmu3lgpi7enkel3hx3yn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cmu3lgpi7enkel3hx3yn","width":1600,"height":900},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tyk5p0jfl2ugw1a9glov.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tyk5p0jfl2ugw1a9glov","width":1207,"height":819}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"0SoGjtMuNRk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ae3izvar9tfqwhrk3zxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ae3izvar9tfqwhrk3zxl","width":2560,"height":1440},"esrb":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Knights_of_the_Round_(video_game)"}]}
