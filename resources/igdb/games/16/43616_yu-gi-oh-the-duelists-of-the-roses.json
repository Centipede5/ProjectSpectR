The Duelists of the Roses sees the heroes of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga and card game series, Yugi Muto and Seto Kaiba, assume the identity of the head of the Lancaster house (Red Rose, later the Tudor dynasty), Henry Tudor, and the leader of the Yorkist faction (White Rose), Christian Rosenkreuz, respectively. The player controls a Rose Duelist, who is initially sent by Henry Tudor (Yugi) and the Lancastrians to Stonehenge, with the mission of disrupting a barrier imposed by the White Rose forces. However, Rosenkreuz (Seto) arrives and offers the hero to side with the Yorkists. From that point on, the player can choose to follow either the Red or the White Rose, in two different scenarios.","collection":3075,"popularity":5.333333333333333,"games":[4108,50834,32510,28182,7615,40477,61985,64902,27092,32851],"tags":[268435471,268435472,536870990,536871213,536871327,536871938,536874083,536874694,536875053,536875054,536875126,536875291,536875467,536875586,536875588],"category":0,"keywords":[78,301,415,1026,3171,3782,4141,4142,4214,4379,4555,4674,4676],"genres":[15,16],"first_release_date":1047772800000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1047772800000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Mar-16","y":2003,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Yu-Gi-Oh!
