Instead this game uses a first person view and has a stationary ship\/turret that is used to shoot down meteors. The game uses the Nokias built in compass to spin around and you tap the touch screen to shoot when the game locks on to a target.\n\nThe game was released on the 5th edition of the Symbian platform for Nokia smartphones.","collection":1369,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[28029,68287,10209,36950,10213,64204,76722,27314,306,76229],"tags":[18,268435461,536870918,536871162,1073741825],"developers":[2421],"publishers":[2421],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[6,250],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1222819200000,"platforms":[55],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":55,"date":1222819200000,"human":"2008-Oct","y":2008,"m":10}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"HBX0FaTJstA"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"HBX0FaTJstA"}],"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Impact"}]}
