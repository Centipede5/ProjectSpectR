It was the first naval simulation to use real-time filled 3D graphics. Its style and mechanics are reminiscent of Epyx's Destroyer (1986). \n \nADS simulates the H.M.S. Onslaught, a British destroyer of the O-class fitted with three cannon turrets, four torpedo tubes on port and starboard respectively, and a sonar to detect and track submarines. In ADS, the Onslaught is not part of a flotilla.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[22399,640,8773,55029,18623,12982,29173,9789,21642,55590],"tags":[39,268435467,268435469,268435471,536870931,536872060,536872383,536875137,536876005,536876737,536877947,1073741825],"publishers":[7095,227],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[19,1148,1471,4225,5093,5825,7035],"themes":[39],"genres":[11,13,15],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[63,13,16,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":25,"human":"TBD"},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/by6z79pktfnmb69lhi2t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"by6z79pktfnmb69lhi2t","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ffse5oi2ecnenr6jfc86.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ffse5oi2ecnenr6jfc86","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vmgpvaiqc1vksywiays2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vmgpvaiqc1vksywiays2","width":640,"height":856}}
