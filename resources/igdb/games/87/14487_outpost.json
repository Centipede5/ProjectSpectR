A single corporation decided the only way for survival was to colonize other worlds. One ship was launched and as it sat in orbit around Jupiter, Earth was no more. Now it is your task to seek out a new planet and repopulate it with human life. The game is set in an isometric third person perspective, like that of Simcity, in which you must re-colonize the planet while dealing with the intricacies of day-to-day life.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44242,24491,28465,75579,75275,34919,75102,33603,36962,55888],"tags":[268435469],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":765158400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":765158400000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Apr-01","y":1994,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ivksq26v3wzck5vszgxt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ivksq26v3wzck5vszgxt","width":800,"height":911},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Outpost_(video_game)"}]}
