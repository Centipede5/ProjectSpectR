Gross. And as if a radical surferpunk made of snot wasn't cool enough to begin with, a power-up gives him a chopper wheel in place of feet. Dude is the hood ornament on his own motorbike! \n \nOne- or two-player (nonsimultaneous).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[94873,1070,1073,47211,5411,17277,31579,106849,99608,51942],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v1q7eh2il1gglp9tz4fz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v1q7eh2il1gglp9tz4fz","width":369,"height":269}}
