In this game, Bub and Bob use a hurdy-gurdy (an old European musical instrument) as a weapon to create the rainbows. \n \nThe game follows the same vertical-scrolling system from the original, but it expands to a third dimension as there are platforms in the background which become accessible through the course of the game. \n \nThe game suffers from reviews stating that it had been overworked with new features, especially those that make this version of the game differ significantly from the original game.[3][4]","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":40,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":40,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1203811200000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1203811200000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Feb-24","y":2008,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mqjgixrhfzux5ci0z46p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mqjgixrhfzux5ci0z46p","width":256,"height":411}}
