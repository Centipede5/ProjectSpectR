Laura Bow, fresh out of college, is hired by a New York newspaper and told to investigate a museum theft. The item is a priceless ancient Egyptian artifact, and possible suspects prove plentiful. During a party to celebrate the opening of the museum's new section, someone is murdered and Laura, after asking to be allowed to investigate, is locked in. This sets the stage for a series of murders, much in the same vein as the original game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[95059,76696,27796,19909,76732,47319,18862,96159,86594,86267],"tags":[536872006],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}]}
