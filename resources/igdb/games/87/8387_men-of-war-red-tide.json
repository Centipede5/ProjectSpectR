Viewed from a top-down perspective, players move soldiers on battlefields and command them to attack, flank, or sneak up on enemy targets. Players can use planted mines, heavy artillery, machine guns, grenades, and anti-tank rifles to kill soldiers and blow up vehicles. Small splashes of blood emit from injured soldiers, and the blood sometimes leaves tiny stains next to bodies on the battlefield. Thus the constant sound of realistic gunfire, the screams of pain, and the depictions of corpses on the ground heighten the impact of the violence in the game. Soldiers use the expletives 'damn' in the heat of battle and dialogue; the German word Scheizen (human excrement) can also be heard on occasion.
