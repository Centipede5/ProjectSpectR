For both the story and visual style I took inspiration from \"The thief of Bagdad\" a 1924 classic silent adventure movie with Douglas Fairbanks. Game mechanics are of classic ultra-hard side shooter. In particular I was inspired by \"Agony\" a beautiful yet unforgiving Amiga game from the 90s.\n\nFinally most of the enemies come from \"Kunstformen der natur\" a book by Ernst Hackel full of litoghraphic illustrations of bizzare creatures perfectly organized with Prussian precision and devotion to symmetry.","hypes":2,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,10039,32902,68287,68142,28751,10209,54639],"tags":[268435461,536871220,536872862,1073741828],"developers":[6930],"publishers":[6930],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[308,1950],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1451520000000,"platforms":[6,82],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":82,"date":1451520000000,"region":8,"human":"2015","y":2015,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1451520000000,"region":8,"human":"2015","y":2015,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Thief of Bagdad - A Flying Carpet Arabian Side Shooter"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m7nrnscyejpsjnw2fphw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m7nrnscyejpsjnw2fphw","width":1359,"height":705},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/movqpfba4rml6v7uhjrb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"movqpfba4rml6v7uhjrb","width":960,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b8bb9mfw2n7jgnptv9i7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b8bb9mfw2n7jgnptv9i7","width":1339,"height":705},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/rostok.itch.io\/tobafcass"}]}
