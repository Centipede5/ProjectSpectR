Inspiration for these changes seems to have come from 2005's God of War. \n \nThe Collector's Edition of this game comes in a special clear slipcase and includes a soundtrack CD and a 30-page art book.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55289,59516,36608,25646,12579,25311,1221,28148,16468,23175],"tags":[1,19,268435468,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1,19],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1288915200000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1288915200000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Nov-05","y":2010,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w8sxqg0ndase6uiolg2e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w8sxqg0ndase6uiolg2e","width":853,"height":1149}}
