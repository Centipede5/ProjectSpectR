It was developed by the same team that created Ikinari Musician for the Famicom earlier in the same year. Like Ikinari Musician, it is not really a game, but rather a music simulator. Unlike Ikinari Musician, Family Composer gives players more control over the music played, and even allows them to compose new songs, and record the compositions to disk.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44242,18623,22470,29173,26145,22425,55689,55590,23867,22406],"tags":[268435463,268435469,536872060,536875049,536877900,536878239],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,4137,6988,7327],"genres":[7,13],"first_release_date":565228800000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":565228800000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Nov-30","y":1987,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xfgj9vwddser2cwqnhkc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xfgj9vwddser2cwqnhkc","width":640,"height":480}}
