Barton then leaves the room and talks to Harris Chapman, an assistant at the university. If Barton talks to him twice, Harris slips his affections for Jennifer and the player will become Jennifer rather than Helen.\nBarton goes downstairs and is interviewed by Nolan Campbell, a reporter, and then he gives the Demon Idol statue to either Rick, a former butler for the Barrows family, or Sullivan, the curator of the local library. Remembering where the statue went is crucial in determining the ending.","collection":2135,"rating":44.0554964007086,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"total_rating":44.0554964007086,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":5,"games":[25646,78632,81249,80916,27266,236,18011,106987,25311,103054],"tags":[1,19,268435458,268435465,268435468,268435487,1073741826],"developers":[1744],"publishers":[1821],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[2,9,12,31],"first_release_date":850435200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":850435200000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Dec-13","y":1996,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":875664000000,"region":2,"human":"1997-Oct-01","y":1997,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":886291200000,"region":1,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Clock Tower 2","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/seyinajcqp7qkzcld5yw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"seyinajcqp7qkzcld5yw","width":1013,"height":597},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ng6ejk23ie445vkdhva8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ng6ejk23ie445vkdhva8","width":480,"height":360}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"t1njdpVV82g"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cccowzd0zta5foae1yhh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cccowzd0zta5foae1yhh","width":528,"height":571}}
