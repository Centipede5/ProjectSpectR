But no wonder the frog is squawking as it gets hammered around the course in a game of croquet with frogs instead of balls. Various conditions to consider too like in golf such as the wind direction or the fact that the ball is a frog and will jump off spiders webs or launch at passing flies. Allows players to enjoy their own characters in versus mode too.","popularity":1,"aggregated_rating":39.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":39.5,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[15851,102805,22690,30830,22453,103377,43585,109273,24198,103218],"tags":[268435470,536870942,536871581,536871601,536872078,536872475,536875090,536875142,536875259,536875271,536875595,536875626,536884022,1073741826],"developers":[617],"publishers":[617],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[30,669,689,1166,1563,4178,4230,4347,4359,4683,4714,13110],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":973123200000,"platforms":[7,21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":973123200000,"human":"2000-Nov-02","y":2000,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1057881600000,"human":"2003-Jul-11","y":2003,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1071705600000,"human":"2003-Dec-18","y":2003,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Kero Kero Kingu Super Deluxe"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/juwyswh7zzd0uy0c5k2i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"juwyswh7zzd0uy0c5k2i","width":256,"height":361},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
