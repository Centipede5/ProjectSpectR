Similar to the Game of Life, players move around a board earning money and occasionally encountering events such as a minigame - in which the player can increase their wealth should they succeed - or a penalty. The game has a Sengoku era theme running throughout, from its samurai characters to the tattooed gambler that rolls a dice for determining how many places a player can move around the board that turn. \n \nBeat Takeshi appears frequently while the game is being played dressed in traditional Sengoku era clothing. The game is presumably in reference to the TV show Takeshi's Castle, which also starred Beat Takeshi and had a Sengoku era theme.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11588,28213,19083,19082,11529,28113,6985,26391,7782,19407],"tags":[17,22,27,268435471,268435482,536871186,536871262,536871641,536873513,536875051,536875067,536875139,536875240,536877913,536879800],"category":0,"keywords":[274,350,729,2601,4139,4155,4227,4328,7001,8888],"themes":[17,22,27],"genres":[15,26],"first_release_date":596419200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":596419200000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Nov-25","y":1988,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":599011200000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Dec-25","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zme25op36qq08nifvy42.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zme25op36qq08nifvy42","width":231,"height":300}}
