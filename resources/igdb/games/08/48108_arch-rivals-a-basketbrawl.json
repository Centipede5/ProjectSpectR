Here's Mohawk, taking it to the hoop... POW! He just got nailed in the alley with a right cross! FOUL! FOUL! FOUL! \nWhat?! No Foul? That's right. No Fouls. This is basketball where breaking the rules is part of the rules! If you can't block a shot - knock your opponent's block off. If you can't steal the ball - steal his shorts! But don't think these tactics are enough to win. Arch Rivals still requires real B-ball skills like passing, shooting, ball handling, slam dunks, and 3 point shots. \nBased on the arcade smash hit, Arch Rivals brings all of its hard-hitting \"in your face\" action into your home. Whether you're going for a fast break, dodging food on the court, or crashing the boards 'til they shatter, Arch Rivals isn't just basketball... it's a basketbrawl!","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[81145,7251,100887,114033,46249,24180,86985,68297,100359,103218],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jhnlzc2ybohjoyhkbxxv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jhnlzc2ybohjoyhkbxxv","width":1280,"height":720}]}
