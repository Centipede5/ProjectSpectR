You must navigate your way through planet Cosmica, and rescue your brethren, within the limited 'Twang' energy you have. \n \nCosmica is full of hideous monsters, many of which can be shot. Your character builds momentum as it moves, so some hazards are easier to clear from a running start. You can only jump vertically, although you have control as the character falls. Ammunition is limited, and must be collected throughout your quest. \n \nThree sweets which enhance your character can be collected - the red one increases your speed, blue increases the height of your leap, and green means you can safely fall further. There are additional objects to pick up and use as well.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19289,55752,47823,37094,26848,25222,10039,25646,27314,236],"tags":[1,17,268435461,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871208,536871939,536872961,1073741828],"developers":[11770],"publishers":[11770],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,1027,2049],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5,8,9,31],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[63,16,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":599529600000,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/woj0moyfnvkebvcetowk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"woj0moyfnvkebvcetowk","width":1000,"height":1447}}
