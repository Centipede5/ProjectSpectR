Gold bars wild randomly spawn on the screen. It is your task to collect the bars and bring them to the assay office. The assay office in turn converts gold bars into money which you have to deposit in your bank. Each player has his own bank in town, so it's a matter of who will get the money to his bank first. After having collected ten bundles of dough you earn a house and heaps of bonus points. You can shoot the other cowboy who wil be hospitalized for a few seconds, giving you the opportunity to collect some gold\/money in the meantime. The two cowboys are also followed by snakes and tumbleweeds respectively. However, snakes only go after one of the two cowboys while the tumbleweeds follow the other one. After being touched by the snakes\/tumbledweeds the cowboy will be paralyzed for a few seconds. Shooting a snake turns it into a tumbleweed (and vice versa) therefore enabling the player to raise the number of enemies for his opponent.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[51485,36794,36657,36608,34919,24199,16468,22819,23175,40524],"tags":[1,268435489,536870921,536871897,1073741826],"publishers":[9466],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[9,985],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u2ats1m5qvo7kkkmrn50.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u2ats1m5qvo7kkkmrn50","width":800,"height":1111}}
