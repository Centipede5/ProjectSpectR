Kids help their Sketchy by using Living Ink - a unique drawing recognition system \u2013 to draw one-of-a kind interactive objects that form the centerpiece of the game's action.   Draw a house and watch the character shrink to fit in the door; draw flames and watch the rocket ship they drew blast off.   \n \nThe game provides a totally unique experience every time it is played. Since the environment is created through each player's personal drawings, the possibilities are as endless and fantastic as the player\u2019s imagination.  The game comes with five themed playsets \u2013 \"Home Sweet Home\", \"Let\u2019s go Camping\", \"Play in Space\", \"A Farm Life\", and perfect for Halloween \u2013 \"A VERY Scary Haunted House.\"  Players unlock playsets by winning star challenges. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tItzaBitza is more than just a fun game.  The game has been crafted specifically for early-readers.  In ItzaBitza, players who are just learning to read start out having a blast watching the whimsical reactions happen between their drawings and their Sketchy.  Then all of a sudden, they need to read to win a star.  Or to know what to draw so they can help their Sketchy.   Parents will be delighted by the game's ability to enhance their child's self-confidence. Unlike some games that leave younger players frustrated by their difficulty and lack of assistance, ItzaBitza provides features to guide children even when faced with unfamiliar concepts. If an early-reader encounters a new word, it can be read aloud to them with the simple act of hovering the mouse over the word.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThrough a delightful twist on drawing games, ItzaBitza introduces a new way for kids to game and while they are playing, really important learning is happening.  New methods to engage children, discovered during a multi-year research project conducted by Microsoft Corporation, are fused into the game's design, yielding a unique experience that encourages fun and learning.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27805,25196,34514,37024,25192,25163,25284,25143,19318,25164],"tags":[536873672],"developers":[7952],"publishers":[7952],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2760],"first_release_date":1252022400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1252022400000,"human":"2009-Sep-04","y":2009,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/opp9yvuifkebwkjfhjr1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"opp9yvuifkebwkjfhjr1","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lermnwioifew8ewoatmu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lermnwioifew8ewoatmu","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oxgxzxnncelkcnrjdi2h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oxgxzxnncelkcnrjdi2h","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gcpam5ul1qqflkpjhk9r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gcpam5ul1qqflkpjhk9r","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p8a4rycp5kuhj6i2wby7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p8a4rycp5kuhj6i2wby7","width":1024,"height":768}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e9jsegmzmskjnmcsqesl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e9jsegmzmskjnmcsqesl","width":211,"height":300},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/sabigames.com\/kids-games\/itzabitza\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/40200"}],"external":{"steam":"40200"}}
