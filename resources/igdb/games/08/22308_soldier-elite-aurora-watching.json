{"id":22308,"name":"Soldier Elite: Aurora Watching","slug":"soldier-elite-aurora-watching","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/soldier-elite-aurora-watching","created_at":1470256297857,"updated_at":1481808361234,"summary":"Metropolis Software's Soldier Elite is like a low-budget, direct-to-video version of Metal Gear Solid. It doesn't have the big names, the peerless production values, or the engaging, intricate plot line. Instead, this Polish-developed third-person stealth action game is saddled with frustrating, half-realized sneaking mechanics, English-as-a-second-language voice acting, and very little inspiration or originality. In short, this is a bad facsimile of a much better game and has a hard time justifying its existence.","storyline":"After the investigation of a Russian submarine crash leads to alarming new intelligence, agent Cole Sullivan (a.k.a. White Fox) is recruited for a mission. Through the use of an arsenal of advanced weapons and high-tech gadgets, Cole\u2019s mission is to infiltrate the suspicious military laboratories controlled by DNA scientist Jacek Parecki and uncover what\u2019s hidden beneath. Soldier Elite is a high-quality and competitively priced modern 3rd person tactical shooter for the PC that combines stealth aspects with action sequences that can be enjoyed by the casual gamer.","collection":1488,"franchise":919,"franchises":[919],"hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":30,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":30,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[103312,76747,37419,78632,80916,81249,106987,87728,76882,107926],"tags":[1,268435480,268435489,268435487,536871041,536872622,1073741826],"developers":[2972],"publishers":[2972],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[129,1710],"themes":[1],"genres":[24,31,33],"first_release_date":1148342400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1148342400000,"region":2,"human":"2006-May-23","y":2006,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Gorky Zero 2: Aurora Watching","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Aurora Watching","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wpmzrwwssx1ypqmwluao.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wpmzrwwssx1ypqmwluao","width":780,"height":585},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ij83ft8pbz0l8vuiqadg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ij83ft8pbz0l8vuiqadg","width":780,"height":585}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"WIFbbPrGP7o"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ryvzqvgeh73yqh74mas0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ryvzqvgeh73yqh74mas0","width":1075,"height":1500},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/reviews\/soldier-elite-review\/1900-6153079\/"}]}
