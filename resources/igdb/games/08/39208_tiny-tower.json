The game tasks players with managing a tower filled with virtual people, referred to as \u201cbitizens\u201d, with the goal of building new floors and gradually making the tower taller, attracts bitizens to move in and work in any floor the player designates. \n \nThe game's reception has generally been positive, receiving 4.5\/5 on Apple's App Store[1] and being awarded iPhone Game of the Year by Apple in 2011.[2] \n \nOn iOS, Tiny Tower is integrated with Apple's social gaming network, Game Center. Game Center provides achievements, leaderboards (based on the number of floors players have) and challenges sent by others. It also allows the player to compare with their Game Center friends' towers. However, Android devices are integrated with the Mobage social gaming network, and unlike Apple's Game Center, an internet connection and a Mobage user name are required to play Tiny Tower. \n \nOn August 24, 2015, Mobage has announced the shutdown of Tiny Tower along with five other Mobage games. The shutdown of the Android version of Tiny Tower was announced for September 24, 2015.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":1308787200000,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1321401600000,"human":"2011-Nov-16","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1308787200000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Jun-23","y":2011,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z1eugaknm4luubnbynpy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z1eugaknm4luubnbynpy","width":320,"height":480}}
