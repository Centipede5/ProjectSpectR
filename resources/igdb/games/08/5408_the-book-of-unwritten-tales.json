Players explore polar environments, interact with fantastical characters (e.g., trolls, orcs, and aliens), and collect inventory items to complete mission objectives. A handful of sequences depict brief acts of violence: an airship shot by canon fire; guards knocked out; penguins firing missiles at a character. The game includes an item labeled Dirty Magazines; on-screen text lists titles such as \u201cGnomes Gone Wild\u201d and \u201cKobolds Bare It All.\u201d During the course of the game, players can use a bottle of brandy on a penguin (i.e., feeding it to the penguin and shaking); other scenes depict a character smoking a cigar.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Mild bad language","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/215160"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/bout.kingart-games.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"215160"}}
