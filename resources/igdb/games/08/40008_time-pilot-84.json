It is the sequel to Time Pilot. The player pilots a craft over many time periods. Unlike the original which told the year of each level, the new time periods are designated by new enemies and different colors. \n \nThere are a large number of enemy types in the game. They each have varying movement patterns, difficulty, and point values. The first button is used to fire a standard shot, which can destroy green-colored enemies. The second button is used to fire missiles, which can destroy the silver-colored enemies. You need to lock on to a silver enemy to fire missiles at it. Destroying enough green enemies brings out a large silver \"boss\" enemy that must be dispatched before advancing to the next level.","collection":4713,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,10209,28029,64204,27314,10213,1877,71455,26766],"tags":[18,268435461,536871015,536871078,536871882,536872651,536876391],"category":0,"keywords":[103,166,970,1739,5479],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ymj2jlb0brrt51ahcyqw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ymj2jlb0brrt51ahcyqw","width":850,"height":1205}}
