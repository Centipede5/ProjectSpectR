Originally, Qureshi was going to create a simple, non-terrifying apartment due to its simultaneous simplicity, familiarity and variety of objects it would contain. However, since the workshop is aimed at game developers, Qureshi decided to attempt to recreate the infamous haunted hallway. You can see screenshots of his impressive work above, or visit his page for a step-by-step breakdown of how he managed this impressive feat (in four weeks by himself, no less).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,28112,13189,25646,28465,28148,34919,33603,36962,40524],"tags":[19,268435488,1073741825],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[19],"genres":[32],"first_release_date":1438300800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1438300800000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jul-31","y":2015,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oygurqtnelkcfwghsaze.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oygurqtnelkcfwghsaze","width":480,"height":360},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/jedlondo.itch.io\/punity"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.the-outline.com\/"}]}
