The object is to throw one of the player\u2019s dice at a die with the same number or one away. When you clear a die, it is added to the player\u2019s poker-like \u201chand\u201d and the bottom of the screen. When you\u2019ve got a winning hand, you can use it clear multiple lines at once. The game has two modes: Mode 1 is a survival mode and Mode 2 is a screen-clear mode.","popularity":1,"games":[55036,29173,25222,60044,55590,23345,19376,18167,14047,8197],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536873787,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[2875,3782],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":676252800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":676252800000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Jun-07","y":1991,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Palamedes 2: Star Twinkles","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nxgzrwdgelobexnxjjrf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nxgzrwdgelobexnxjjrf","width":400,"height":274}}
