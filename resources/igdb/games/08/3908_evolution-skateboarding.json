It consists of several popular skateboarders, such as Rick McCrank, Arto Saari, Kerry Getz, and Danny Way. There is also a create-a-skater feature and an unlockable character for every skater the player completes the game as. There are also sets of level specific songs such as the metal-remix of the Metal Gear Solid theme and a Castlevania theme after unlocking the Vampire Hunter. Levels are unlocked by beating a certain amount of objectives in a current level, such as collecting items like boots and other objects, performing tricks in certain areas of a level, and the occasional grinding a certain amount of meters. The Evolution Skateboarding engine was used in the bonus skateboarding mode included in the PlayStation 2 version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6692,71452,70999,102134,15851,102805,22690,10090,103020,76566],"tags":[1,268435470,536870962,536873064,536873825,536875090,536875122,536875184,536875364,536875413,536875469,536875809,536876266,536876349,536876719,536877099,536878035,536879799,1073741826],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[50,2152,2913,4178,4210,4272,4452,4501,4557,4897,5354,5437,5807,6187,7123,8887],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1034121600000,"platforms":[21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1037491200000,"human":"2002-Nov-17","y":2002,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1034121600000,"human":"2002-Oct-09","y":2002,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/le9cr4bc5o5bisunimhk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"le9cr4bc5o5bisunimhk","width":256,"height":311},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
