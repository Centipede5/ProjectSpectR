From an overhead prospective, players maneuver across battlefields and use various weapons (e.g., rifles, machine guns, rocket launchers) to kill enemy soldiers. Combat is accompanied by realistic gunfire, explosions, and cries of pain; enemies emit blood puffs when shot, remaining in pools of blood when killed. Players can also attack fleeing pedestrians who fall to the ground (but eventually recover). In one mission, players can explore a bloodstained torture chamber\u2014a bloody corpse is depicted on a table. Another mission allows players to enter a brothel and acquire pornography as inventory items (e.g., \u201cExotic Lesbian Magazine,\u201d\u201cKinky Kittens\u201d), though each magazine cover is obscured. Some of the dialogue also includes sexual remarks or innuendo (e.g., \u201c[P]lease spare me the bad sperm jokes\u201d and \u201cI don't trust it any more than I trust a man's zipper!\u201d). The words \u201cf**k,\u201d\u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":6},"external":{"steam":"57740"}}
