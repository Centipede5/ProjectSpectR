The authorities realised that the racers had stumbled upon a fun solution to the zombie problem, so promised the drivers a life in the sun on an off-world colony; the kind that even millionaire playboys would struggle to attain. With a marvellous prize up for grabs, and no one marshalling the races, the events rapidly took a violent turn, and everyone competing had to remember: \"Drive to Survive.\"","collection":131,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44076,19561,665,68142,26192,26709,7631,7329,59516,3772],"tags":[1,18,19,268435460,268435466,536870917,536870937,536870981,536871021,536871041,536871067,536871396,536872220,536872800,536874337,536874539,536875069,536875117,536876980,1073741826],"developers":[1201],"publishers":[9318],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[5,25,69,109,129,155,484,1308,1888,3425,3627,4157,4205,6068],"themes":[1,18,19],"genres":[4,10],"first_release_date":964483200000,"platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":964483200000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Jul-25","y":2000,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/madwqdb9n5pwrhzlynak.jpg","cloudinary_id":"madwqdb9n5pwrhzlynak","width":858,"height":633},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f51c3vxmwa3bbujec5ea.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f51c3vxmwa3bbujec5ea","width":320,"height":232},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oa8i7uot8iwqootn7hhe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oa8i7uot8iwqootn7hhe","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"CQxOE-E0HSI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q1vaix5bp9eu7ptgnrso.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q1vaix5bp9eu7ptgnrso","width":800,"height":563},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/carmageddon.wikia.com\/wiki\/Carmageddon_64"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carmageddon_64"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.carmageddon.com\/history\/carmageddon-64"}]}
