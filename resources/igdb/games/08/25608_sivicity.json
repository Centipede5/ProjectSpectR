Those who inhabit the city are called Sivillians. \n \nSiviCity\u2019s target is to become a simulator\/role play of sorts, a system where Sivillians can set up businesses and attempt to become the best in their trade, whether it be selling furniture, designing rooms, having your own private security group, having a caf\u00e9 or restaurant, and more. \n \nSivillians will be given a multitude of business opportunities to suit their individual needs. This will be SiviCity\u2019s primary function, alongside the ability to chat with other sivillians, build private apartments, and indulge in mini-games and other interactive games within the City. \n \nSiviCITY is still very much in an early testing stage, so we appreciate all the feedback we can get, and we appreciate you spending time in helping us further develop our game.\"","storyline":"Users, named 'Sivillians', inhabit the city and can either create their own personal Apartments, or hang out in Town Spaces. In these virtual areas, users can communicate, add friends, chat and trade items with each other. Users are allowed to purchase units of virtual currency, Coins, which can be used to purchase virtual furniture, membership of exclusive clubs, or rounds of games. Users will also be able to create their own business and gain a secondary currency called \"experience\". Using this, Sivillians can move up the social and business scale by dominating their market or their area. The Sivillians business will depend on their field of choice and also where they decide to open their first shop. You could sell furniture, have a cafe, have your own Casino* or your even your own hotel just to name a few. The options are endless! \n \nUsers can add friends which they can communicate with via built-in messaging systems, or by inviting the users to the rooms they are in.","popularity":3,"games":[26574,90099,113114,81249,9599,43165,25311,26163,9243,22099],"tags":[33,38,268435468,268435469,536871511,536872384,536872420,536873252,536873304,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[11436],"publishers":[11436],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[2,5],"keywords":[599,1472,1508,2340,2392],"themes":[33,38],"genres":[12,13],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ib5xjsyckdrcxexz7f6g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ib5xjsyckdrcxexz7f6g","width":414,"height":154}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l4fiwwhebkc0lietzqyo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l4fiwwhebkc0lietzqyo","width":341,"height":195},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/sivicity.com"}]}
