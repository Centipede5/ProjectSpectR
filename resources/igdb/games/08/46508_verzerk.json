The phrases from the original arcade version of \"shoot him\", \"chicken, fight like a robot\", \"got you humanoid\", etc. are included in this release. The game plays identically to Berzerk though, aside from that and only being for one player.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1012521600000,"platforms":[70],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":70,"date":1012521600000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Feb-01","y":2002,"m":2}]}
