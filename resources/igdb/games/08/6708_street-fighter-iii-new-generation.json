Street Fighter III was produced for the CD-ROM-based CP System III hardware, which allowed for more elaborate 2D graphics than the CPS II-based Street Fighter Alpha games (the previous incarnation of the Street Fighter series), while revamping many of the play mechanics. The game, which was designed as a direct sequel to Street Fighter II, initially discarded every previous character except for Ryu and Ken (hence the \"New Generation\" subtitle), introducing an all-new roster led by Alex.","collection":2884,"franchise":792,"franchises":[792],"rating":76.2564873722318,"popularity":2,"total_rating":76.2564873722318,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":5,"games":[6709,6702,884,4238,6710,24287,2933,17548,1244,6386],"tags":[1,268435460,268435489,536870973,536871019,536871353,536871470,536871784,536872143,536872258,536873064,536874398,536875073,536875298,536875778,536875895,536875931,536876092,536876114,536876308,536876810,536876816,536876824,536876825,536876830,536876835,536877012,536877237,536877416,536877696,536877783,536878199,536878351,536879765,536879786,536881366,536882292,536883325,536883458,536883943,1073741828],"developers":[37],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[61,107,441,558,872,1231,1346,2152,3486,4161,4386,4866,4983,5019,5180,5202,5396,5898,5904,5912,5913,5918,5923,6100,6325,6504,6784,6871,7287,7439,8853,8874,10454,11380,12413,12546,13031],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,33],"first_release_date":854755200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":883526400000,"region":2,"human":"1997","y":1997,"m":12},{"category":1,"platform":52,"date":854755200000,"human":"1997-Feb","y":1997,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Street Fighter 3: New Generation","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Street Fighter III"},{"name":"\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u2162 NEW GENERATION"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wsjiahrekz0gqsglgjpt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wsjiahrekz0gqsglgjpt","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uijjya6tdpn8hwcxbnlv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uijjya6tdpn8hwcxbnlv","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nptyfxaf382z4gac0187.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nptyfxaf382z4gac0187","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l5mp5j6flmvpkasm6tsp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l5mp5j6flmvpkasm6tsp","width":384,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nnhckwcipoikehzdixhk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nnhckwcipoikehzdixhk","width":384,"height":224}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tc1gpx5upnyl5kbnf4z7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tc1gpx5upnyl5kbnf4z7","width":222,"height":318},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Street_Fighter_III"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/streetfighter.wikia.com\/wiki\/Street_Fighter_III:_New_Generation"}]}
