As players progress chronologically through the storyline, they use assorted weapons (e.g., swords, staffs, axes, bows) to defeat goblins, trolls, and other fantasy creatures; combat is accompanied by realistic battle cries and slashing sounds; slow-motion effects may occur as defeated enemies burst into Lego pieces. Players can occasionally ride atop horses through battlefields and engage in one-on-one magic duels. Cutscenes reenact other dramatic events from the movies (e.g., a warrior getting struck down by orcs; a wizard falling into a crevasse; armies fighting each other on the battlefield). A handful of sequences depict slapstick-style humor: a creature kicking a character in the crotch; a character sniffing his armpit; a character landing close to a pile of animal droppings.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards fantasy characters - Pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.thelordoftherings.lego.com"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lego_The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(video_game)"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/lego.wikia.com\/wiki\/LEGO_The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Video_Game"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/214510"}],"external":{"steam":"214510"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":46,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
