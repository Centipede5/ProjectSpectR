The game offers a strategic and persistent winnable Campaign that is completely player-driven, both in the strategic planning and players fighting to control territory. \n \nALL OUT WAR, ON A MASSIVE SCALE \n \nIts scale is a massive 300,000 SQ KM that is an interconnected and zone-less game world offering total freedom for players. This scale allows for truly immersive combined arms pvp combat. Communication between the Army, Air Force, and Naval units that are engaged will help determine the outcome! There are no limitations to how many players can interact in a battle space. \n \nLARGE WEAPON SELECTION AVAILABLE \nWWII Online offers over 100 playable weapons and vehicles that are modeled to the specifications of the original manufacturer! Each country has a historically researched weapon set that makes the game play for each country different and challenging! You'll never fight the same engagement twice! \n \nSERIOUS HISTORICAL ACCURACY \nAll weapons, vehicles, munitions and ordinance perform according to realistic values. We have achieved this through direct access to historical archives, a network of military experts and our advanced proprietary game engine that goes in depth like never before. Armor on tanks and aircraft, as well as their internal components, \nare modeled down to the millimeter. \n \nHIGHLY DETAILED DAMAGE MODELS \nOur damage models go into extreme detail with each component being destroyable in vehicles including crew, weapon storage, gas tanks and more! You don\u2019t just shoot a hitbox? NO! With every shot fired, multiple calculations take place that determine the round impact consequences. Some of these include; angle of obliquity, speed of round at impact, thickness of the armor, internal spall, armor penetration, parts of tank damaged, etc. \n \nFAIR GAME PLAY FOR ALL \nJust like in real life, the outcome of each engagement will be determined by strategy, tactics, teamwork, and your weapon handling skills! In WWII Online there are no special power ups or item buys giving someone a special advantage against other players. Every rifle is just as lethal whether you are a premium subscriber or a free \nplayer.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"tags":[1073741825],"developers":[13557],"publishers":[146],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[19],"themes":[1,22,38,39],"genres":[5,24],"first_release_date":1009756800000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1041292800000,"human":"2002","y":2002,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1009756800000,"human":"2001","y":2001,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"World War II Online: Battleground Europe"},{"name":"Battleground Europe"},{"name":"WWII Online: Battleground Europe"},{"name":"WWII Online","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uhoizruh9hcfq4bjgmuw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uhoizruh9hcfq4bjgmuw","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nwqsrsnwrbqlqx1xacep.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nwqsrsnwrbqlqx1xacep","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/metunxa8xzexbhn1canj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"metunxa8xzexbhn1canj","width":1000,"height":625},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y49njwognehnyv6nykob.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y49njwognehnyv6nykob","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yv6p98ecc1lxyycmwqla.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yv6p98ecc1lxyycmwqla","width":1280,"height":800}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ogEjCZn8mHY"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"xjcAFjniM1s"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vxcpmaaqzpmwuqe4fzf3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vxcpmaaqzpmwuqe4fzf3","width":528,"height":754},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/251950"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/tuberafter"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/corneredrats"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/battlegroundeurope"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_War_II_Online"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/wiki.wwiionline.com"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.wwiionline.com"}]}
