As general manager, your job is to build the best lineup of players to take your team to the World Series. You can make complex player trades and sign players to multi-year contracts as you build your team, but you'll have to compete with the other General Managers, and negotiate with the player's agents. \n \nBaseball Mogul is designed to help you manage your team over many simulated years. Manage your team one day at a time, or let the computer simulate weeks or months at a stretch so you can play for virtual years or decades. As your players age, their abilities mature and decline realistically. Don't forget to build your team for the long term, rather than spending all your money on free agents this season. Version 9.1.6 may include unspecified updates, enhancements, or bug fixes. Limited to one full season of play.","collection":157,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[77770,72677,72676,72675,66198,66542,59990,58514,58510,38707],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536875562,536883035],"category":0,"keywords":[20,4650,12123],"genres":[14],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y5saiwl9rasqqsnu5xcn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y5saiwl9rasqqsnu5xcn","width":280,"height":400}}
