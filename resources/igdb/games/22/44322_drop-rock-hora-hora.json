Pushing the button toggles between 'open' and 'closed', which affects whether the ball will bounce in a shallow or steep angle when it hits. Missing the ball will eventually destroy the barrier behind you so you must keep your wits about you at all times.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":641433600000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":641433600000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Apr-30","y":1990,"m":4}]}
