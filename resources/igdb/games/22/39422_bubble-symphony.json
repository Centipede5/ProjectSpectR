(Giant bubbles can be blown by charging up the character. The bubble button is held until the character's horns begin flashing, and then releasing the button.) There are a total of 80 levels, while the last 10 levels can only be accessed by collecting 7 potions.","collection":2813,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,1070,51485,26848,1073,55752,37094,34919,76229,1188],"tags":[1,268435464,536871049,536871244,536871306,536874398,536875489,536876489,536876971],"category":0,"keywords":[137,332,394,3486,4577,5577,6059],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":825638400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":825638400000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Mar-01","y":1996,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Bubble Bobble 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xz6djc1vjo5fem7udrpt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xz6djc1vjo5fem7udrpt","width":256,"height":189}}
