When the small craft is accidentally fired upon, it creates a strange electromagnetic effect that envelops the Earth, causing it to disappear. While its gravity remains, the physical Earth simply isn't there. The moonbase, surviving on scrounged resources and manpower, builds an interstellar ship. A team of four specialists is then sent into deep space to find unique parts for the construction of the Centauri Drive, a machine that the moonbase scientists hope will cause a reverse effect.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,25300,36950,19301,25311,27314,8773,11582,19448,11423],"tags":[18,268435471,268435487,536871882,536871938,536871939,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1026,1027,3782],"themes":[18],"genres":[15,31],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fhw9fel8oc55szd4evt7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhw9fel8oc55szd4evt7","width":640,"height":693}}
