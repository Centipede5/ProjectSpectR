{"id":48122,"name":"Fun House","slug":"fun-house","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/fun-house","created_at":1499955465539,"updated_at":1515838313812,"summary":"The general gameplay concept is that each level is like a child's version of The Running Man with a basic top-down view. Players must throw tomatoes skillfully at a series of easy-to-hit targets. Some elements of the game are indirectly taken from the classic arcade game Pole Position (except that the player does not have the option to play as a Formula One vehicle). \nIn order to make it to the next level, the player must make it from the starting line to the finish within the time limit with a young child on inline skates. Otherwise, the player loses a chance and the player must start the stage over again. The host of the televised game show, J. D. Roth, congratulates players for winning a stage while taunting the player with late 1980s\/early 1990s sarcasm when he loses a \"chance.\" Icy floors and slime colored ramps offer an additional challenge to the player. There are 72 rooms in the entire Fun House; with targets that are either numbered or given a generic target graphic. Each room has a name that usually gives a clue about how the room's design is implemented. Although the player is given three chances to successfully navigate the entire Fun House, collecting 25 silver coins acts as a 1-up. Warp zones will allow players to access the more difficult levels of the Fun House at an earlier time; thus allowing gamers who are pressed for time a chance to beat the game with a higher level of risk.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,51464,28029,10039,76098,7329,72373,18387,36781,76246],"tags":[1,27,268435461,268435486,536871262,536871846,536871937,536872211,536875054,536875411,536875412,536879173,536881061],"category":0,"keywords":[350,934,1025,1299,4142,4499,4500,8261,10149],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[5,30],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wg3ayshx8hxiwqtjwj4a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wg3ayshx8hxiwqtjwj4a","width":400,"height":550}}
