Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered I.S.A. forces. \n \nThis is the very rare steelbook of Killzone Collector's Editon. It's one of few games that exist for the PS2 that come with a steelbook.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1078963200000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1078963200000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Mar-11","y":2004,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/orpz3gaworpb8w35xgsx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"orpz3gaworpb8w35xgsx","width":1280,"height":720}]}
