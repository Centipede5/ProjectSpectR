There are three mission types: Scud Defense, Jet Defense and Tomahawk Offensive. The defense-type missions are reminiscent of Missile Command -- jets and missiles appear on the screen, and the player must defend cities on the ground by directing defensive fire with the mouse. In the Tomahawk Offensive missions, the situation is reversed -- the player is given a target and must hit it by maneuvering a missile around defensive fire, launching it towards the ground as soon as it is lined up with its intended target.","storyline":"You command U.S. air and anti-aircraft forces in this exciting, fully animated re-creation of the air war over the Persian Gulf. \nWhile you launch Tomahawk sir strikes against enemy positions, you must also defend your own from incoming SCUD missiles and attack jets. \nWith action as intense as anything at the video arcade, you'll need steady hands and nerves of steel in each and every mission! \nTerrific!","popularity":1,"tags":[1073741828],"developers":[15646],"publishers":[15647,1133],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1033,1447,4034,17227],"themes":[1,21,39],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":694224000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":694224000000,"human":"1992-Jan-01","y":1992,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Desert Storm Command"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k2fbof1xkzj2kj6dx4b8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k2fbof1xkzj2kj6dx4b8","width":640,"height":350}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"b-3oPgxg2sw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aa2derkwvdgucfhx5epn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aa2derkwvdgucfhx5epn","width":800,"height":805},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sand_Storm_(video_game)"}]}
