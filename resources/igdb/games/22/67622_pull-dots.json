{"id":67622,"name":"Pull Dots","slug":"pull-dots","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/pull-dots","created_at":1505419727189,"updated_at":1505435069000,"summary":"Pull Dots is a highly addictive puzzle game. \n \nThe goal is to clear all colored dots from the board using up to four black dots. Use game bonuses to achieve this goal. \n \n** Game Modes ** \n \nTimed Mode: \nHow fast can you pull the black dot? It's an exciting race against time to clear the board of all colored dots. \n \nPerfect 12: \nHow well can you plan your moves? A more strategic mode where the goal is to clear every colored dot for 12 Loops. The catch is, the board increases in difficulty from Loop to Loop. \n \nCasual Mode: \nWorry less about strategy because leaving 2 dots on the board is still considered a cleared Loop. \n \nInfinite Mode: \nJust enjoy the game without any worrying about strategy or time, with an unlimited amount of bonuses and moves. \n \n** Game Bonuses ** \n \nAdditions: \nUse additions to add a previously removed black dot \n \nSubtractions: \nUse subtractions to remove an individual color dot \n \nSkips: \nUse skip bonuses to skip the current Loop (level) if you get stuck. \n \nColor Change: \nEach black dot can be converted into a color dot via a triple tap gesture. This is most useful when there is one color dot left on the board. \n \n** Features ** \n \nLeaderboards: \nCompete against other Pull Dots players for the highest score worldwide! The Pull Dots Leaderboards can be accessed via the Trophy scene or after the game ends by clicking the \"Leaderboards\" button. \n \n- You must be signed into Game Center in order for this feature to work","popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_title":"Pull Dots","tags":[1073741825,1073741827],"developers":[13455],"publishers":[2407],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[92,1163,3133,3134,4083],"themes":[1,32],"genres":[2,9,15,24],"first_release_date":1506297600000,"platforms":[39],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1506297600000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Sep-25","y":2017,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b92z49hxb8m2978uwkb3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b92z49hxb8m2978uwkb3","width":1242,"height":2208},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tkanfj9pwnqvz5mp7blm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tkanfj9pwnqvz5mp7blm","width":1242,"height":2208},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z9kcizbt9ba33qffh7hg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z9kcizbt9ba33qffh7hg","width":1242,"height":2208},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j5nhtvcigdwo8uq5vjyq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j5nhtvcigdwo8uq5vjyq","width":1242,"height":2208}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"SFoCKgH7KI4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zwwtmxkyquye1srhjzt5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zwwtmxkyquye1srhjzt5","width":1024,"height":1024},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/www.appstore.com\/pulldots"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/pulldots"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/pulldots"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PullDots"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pulldots"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.pulldots.com"}]}
