Continuing their policy of providing educational material that is both instructional and entertaining, the staffs of Scott, Foresman and Company and the Texas Instruments Learning Center expand their mathematics series to include the Multiplication 1 Solid State Software\u2122 Command Module. The Multiplication 1 module shows your child the \"Magic of Multiplication\". It provides a strong foundation not only in the basic facts, but also in later work with larger numbers. Colorful graphics and lively music transform the learning of factors and products into an exciting experience \u2014 almost like magic! The Multiplication 1 module contains eight activities: \n- EQUAL GROUPS changes an addition problem into a multiplication problem using the concept of number grouping. \n- FACTORS 2 TO 5 explains horizontal multiplication problems for factors 2 through 5. \n- FACTORS 0 TO 5 demonstrates multiplication of a factor by 2, 1, and then 0 (zero). \n- FACTORS 6 TO 9 increases the multiplication skills to include the factors 6 to 9. \n- MULTIPLY ANOTHER WAY presents a smooth transition from the horizontal multiplication problem to the vertical problem. \n- HOW MANY IN ALL uses a random number of hats \"sprouting\" a random number of flowers to demonstrate solving for the product. \n- COMPLETE THE BOX provides one factor while your child selects the other and then solves for the missing number (the product of the two factors). \n- REVIEW THE FACTS offers 28 multiplication problems with factors 0 (zero) to 9. A stage is set complete with a magician and audience that stands up each time your child correctly answers the displayed problem. \n \nThe Multiplication 1 module advances your child to more difficult drills according to the number of correct responses given in each activity. The computer automatically advances to the next activity if your child answers 80 percent of the drill problems correctly. If less than 60 percent of the problems are answered correctly, the computer returns to the appropriate activity, providing your child with more practice. This automation helps alleviate anxieties caused by consistently incorrect responses, making the learning of mathematical skills a pleasurable and rewarding experience. With this module, Texas Instruments continues its tradition of applying innovative Solid State Speech\u2122 technology to educational activities. Multiplication 1 is designed to work with or without the Texas Instruments Solid State Speech\u2122 Synthesizer (sold separately). However, the Speech Synthesizer must be attached to activate the voice of the computer. The computer's voice then gives directions, reads the equations, and encourages your child to \"Try again\" when he or she gives an incorrect answer. The addition of speech strengthens the learning process since your child can hear, as well as see, the correct answers.","popularity":1,"category":0}
