First you need to examine the patient's medical chart to find out what's wrong, and which conditions are the most critical. Now to save the patient, you control a robot probe which can be used to administer aspirin, antiseptic, or ultrasonics to clear up the problem. You should clear up the most critical conditions first, then move on to the less serious areas to ensure your patient survives. Your probe should navigate through the veins, arteries, and lymph; if you guide the probe outside these areas, it's movement will slow down and swarms of white blood cells will attack it, depleting the limited energy supply. There are 197 different patients you need to help, each with different ailments.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[30830,44242,103020,37419,17548,27744,22690,15851,35371,18623],"tags":[1,34,268435461,268435469,268435470,536871041,536871534,536871678,536871701,536871828,536872060,536872078,536875093,536875548,536876005,536876028,536877431,536878578,536880680],"developers":[2522],"publishers":[2522],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[129,622,766,789,916,1148,1166,4181,4636,5093,5116,6519,7666,9768],"themes":[1,34],"genres":[5,13,14],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[67,13,129],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":129,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":67,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mpg6uk5u0hglems0ze0i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mpg6uk5u0hglems0ze0i","width":220,"height":312}}
