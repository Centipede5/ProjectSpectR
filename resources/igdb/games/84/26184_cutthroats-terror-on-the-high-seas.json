{"id":26184,"name":"Cutthroats: Terror on the High Seas","slug":"cutthroats-terror-on-the-high-seas","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/cutthroats-terror-on-the-high-seas","created_at":1480724096883,"updated_at":1517270876243,"summary":"The game is set in the 17th century in the Caribbean and unlike most pirate games, it is mostly historically accurate. The game world is covered with settlements according to the time period the player picks at the start (and evolves accordingly as the game progresses) and each settlement is ruled by one of the five new world powers, Spain, England, France, The Netherlands and Denmark. Also some settlements are ruled at certain times by independent rulers, e.g. Tortuga and Belize. These settlements can be attacked by the player, meaning his crew, with weapons the player chose, will land at the town and can then be controlled to burn and pillage it. Other than this the player controls a ship unit upon a map of the Spanish Main and can plot courses to pins which represent towns; however, if an NPC ship is close enough to the player (these ships spawn at the settlements with goals such as trade between towns or to find pirates), the player will be alerted and go into a smaller bird's-eye map in which they can raise flags to either enter diplomacy with the ship such as asking for information, raise nation flags to avoid them, or obviously raise the Jolly Roger to attack them. Ship combat is worked much as town combat with the player controlling his ship(s) with advanced controls such as where to aim cannon, and what type of shot, right down to scuttling the ship or setting it ablaze.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55590,18623,9199,44242,55689,19934,23345,19376,33603],"tags":[268435469,268435471,536871938,536872060,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[1026,1148,3782],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":938649600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":938649600000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Sep-30","y":1999,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nulhakg2eoiv9lor27wb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nulhakg2eoiv9lor27wb","width":424,"height":500}}
