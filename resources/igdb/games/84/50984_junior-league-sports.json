The Game visuals are set in a cartoon\/childlike environment. Each game revolves around playing an informal game of the sport. The game does not attempt a realistic simulation, or implement all the technical rules of the sports. The Game lets the player challenge an AI team or play head to head against a friend. Good play generates SKILL points that allow team members to pull-off spectacular cartoon-style moves, such as extended jumps, and super shots leaving a trail of stars that are guaranteed to go in. Single player Mode offers a knock-out cup and a league where every team will play every other team, and the one with the most points at the end comes top.","popularity":1,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1276560000000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1276560000000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Jun-15","y":2010,"m":6}]}
