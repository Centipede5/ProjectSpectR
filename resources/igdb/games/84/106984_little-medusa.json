While the Olympians hold court and control the fate of mortals, the Titans fester in their prisons deep underground. Now, A new generation of Olympians is coming into their own.

She is intelligent, beautiful, and resourceful, but also quite aware that she is the favorite of the gods, and this has made her quite haughty and vain. \n \nFiora, a goddess of strife and magic, is angered by the smug Olympians doting on their precious Artemiza. Her husband, Kronus was the lord of the Titans, and has been long-imprisoned in another realm. Their separation has stripped Fiora of the chance to have a family of her own.
