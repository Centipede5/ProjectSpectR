The two partners are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists.","collection":2019,"franchise":2,"franchises":[2],"rating":91.19945874272742,"popularity":13,"total_rating":91.19945874272742,"total_rating_count":178,"rating_count":178,"games":[191,616,86657,62151,8762,27316,24426,11542,186,20342],"tags":[1,17,20,22,27,268435458,268435465,268435487,536870931,536870979,536871115,536871262,536871470,536871599,536871878,536871889,536871939,536871991,536872070,536872225,536872317,536872328,536872435,536872668,536872715,536873017,536874115,536874906,536875050,536875054,536875067,536875095,536875099,536875111,536875137,536875199,536875209,536875228,536875229,536875249,536875294,536875308,536875362,536875525,536875531,536875572,536875587,536875606,536875639,536875778,536875792,536876174,536876263,536876499,536876573,536876586,536876694,536876737,536876808,536877501,536877748,536877780,536877928,536878005,536878012,536878481,536878484,536879177,536880676,536882730,536883241,536885090,536885422,1073741828,1073741827],"developers":[10],"publishers":[10,227],"game_engines":[53,144],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":44565,"completely":32400},"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[19,67,203,350,558,687,966,977,1027,1079,1158,1313,1405,1416,1523,1756,1803,2105,3203,3994,4138,4142,4155,4183,4187,4199,4225,4287,4297,4316,4317,4337,4382,4396,4450,4613,4619,4660,4675,4694,4727,4866,4880,5262,5351,5587,5661,5674,5782,5825,5896,6589,6836,6868,7016,7093,7100,7569,7572,8265,9764,11818,12329,14178,14510],"themes":[1,17,20,22,27],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":707356800000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[14,13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":13,"date":707356800000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jun","y":1992,"m":6},{"category":1,"platform":14,"date":707356800000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jun","y":1992,"m":6},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":757296000000,"region":8,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d3umx272oww0pziwj5ww.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d3umx272oww0pziwj5ww","width":451,"height":338},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yuonqjls1qbs21t5n7sj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yuonqjls1qbs21t5n7sj","width":490,"height":306},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lxtxpgeeoppdy9svjigh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lxtxpgeeoppdy9svjigh","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yhtzfqykz0b5ucb3c2ni.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yhtzfqykz0b5ucb3c2ni","width":960,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y3s8o3dc02nf67iqyts0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y3s8o3dc02nf67iqyts0","width":388,"height":291}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"2wEQ7a7oxmE"},{"name":"Gameplay","video_id":"dFnCMo8MMzQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wcofq8vczh5xnbizmxzi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wcofq8vczh5xnbizmxzi","width":484,"height":600},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.lucasarts.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/6010"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Fate_of_Atlantis"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/indianajones.wikia.com\/wiki\/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Fate_of_Atlantis"}],"external":{"steam":"6010"}}
