There are three buttons for each player - Attack, which normally is used to make Thunder and Fox (the game's heroes) stab with their knives. Jump, and a Weapon button which fires or throws a weapon acquired by the heroes. \n \nWhat makes this game unique is that the game gives players the opportunity to allow players to use their obtained weapons (save for the hand grenades) as melee weapons which helps conserve ammunition for when it's needed.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
