{"id":2584,"name":"EVE Online","slug":"eve-online","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/eve-online","created_at":1373497010106,"updated_at":1543151057639,"summary":"EVE takes place 20,000 years in the future. Humans have constructed a jumpgate in a wormhole named EVE. After many humans colonize the dimension on other side of the wormhole, the gate explodes, denying the humans contact with Earth. In the panic that ensues, many of the new colonies are destroyed, technology and knowledge lost. For thousands of years the colonies struggle and finally they regain all that they had lost. The only problem is that each of the colonies has formed different factions and races. \n \n \n \nEve is a massively multiplayer, online game that lets you play as a member of five different races as you explore, build, and form coalitions to protect your empire.","storyline":"Set more than 21,000 years in the future, the background story of Eve Online explains that humanity, having used up most of Earth's resources through centuries of explosive population growth, began colonizing the rest of the Milky Way. As on Earth, this expansion also led to competition and fighting over available resources, but everything changed with the discovery of a natural wormhole leading to an unexplored galaxy subsequently dubbed \"New Eden.\" Dozens of colonies were founded, and a structure, a gate of sorts (which bears the inscription \"EVE\" on the New Eden side), was built to stabilize the wormhole that linked the colonies of New Eden with the rest of human civilization. However, when the wormhole unexpectedly collapsed, it destroyed the gate as well as the connection between the colonies of New Eden and the Milky Way. Cut off from the rest of humanity and supplies from Earth, the colonies of New Eden were left starving and disconnected from one another; many died out entirely. Over the millennia the descendants of the surviving colonists managed to rebuild their own societies, but by this time the memories and knowledge of humanity's origins, of Earth and the Milky Way galaxy, as well as the history of the settling of New Eden, was lost; what little information that survived transmission over the generations was misunderstood, lost in translation, and\/or consigned to mythology. Five major distinct societies rose to prominence from the surviving colonies, each growing into interstellar spaceflight-capable civilizations. The states based around these societies make up the five major factions in Eve Online: the Amarr Empire, the Caldari State, the Gallente Federation, the Minmatar Republic and the Jove Directorate.","collection":288,"rating":72.17473121255199,"popularity":4.333333333333334,"aggregated_rating":78.75,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":75.462365606276,"total_rating_count":30,"rating_count":24,"games":[603,50790,3075,25657,17111,7046,1939,17130,3019,1595],"tags":[1,18,268435468,268435469,268435471,536870935,536871015,536871113,536871148,536871422,536871470,536871776,536871812,536871859,536871882,536871904,536871906,536871970,536872060,536872070,536872131,536872245,536872406,536872651,536872840,536872914,536873089,536873092,536873186,536875046,536875064,536875095,536875169,536875173,536875196,536875246,536875271,536875307,536875356,536875358,536875455,536875539,536875735,536875784,536875796,536875798,536875799,536875887,536875897,536876028,536876174,536876246,536876247,536876248,536876249,536876405,536876546,536876718,536877141,536877142,536877208,536877209,536877216,536877439,536877526,536877762,536877778,536878215,536879024,536879053,536879132,536879234,536879774,536879840,536880182,536880294,536880298,536880363,536880383,536880607,536880643,536880743,536880753,536880815,536881122,536881260,536881289,536881312,536881391,536881949,536882034,536882362,536882386,536882483,536882727,536883035,536883300,536883301,536883326,536883980,536885187,536885994,536886556,536886557,536886558,536886559,536886560,536886561,536886562,536886563,1073741826],"developers":[853],"publishers":[853],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[2,3,5],"keywords":[23,103,201,236,510,558,864,900,947,970,992,994,1058,1148,1158,1219,1333,1494,1739,1928,2002,2177,2180,2274,4134,4152,4183,4257,4261,4284,4334,4359,4395,4444,4446,4543,4627,4823,4872,4884,4886,4887,4975,4985,5116,5262,5334,5335,5336,5337,5493,5634,5806,6229,6230,6296,6297,6304,6527,6614,6850,6866,7303,8112,8141,8220,8322,8862,8928,9270,9382,9386,9451,9471,9695,9731,9831,9841,9903,10210,10348,10377,10400,10479,11037,11122,11450,11474,11571,11815,12123,12388,12389,12414,13068,14275,15082,15644,15645,15646,15647,15648,15649,15650,15651],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[12,13,15],"expansions":[74970],"first_release_date":1052179200000,"pulse_count":158,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1053648000000,"region":1,"human":"2003-May-23","y":2003,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1053648000000,"region":1,"human":"2003-May-23","y":2003,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1053648000000,"region":1,"human":"2003-May-23","y":2003,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1052179200000,"region":2,"human":"2003-May-06","y":2003,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1052179200000,"region":2,"human":"2003-May-06","y":2003,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1052179200000,"region":2,"human":"2003-May-06","y":2003,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"EVE
