Players can select from four difficulty ratings and the controls are a simple digital joystick to move right or left and a fire button. Individual enemy ships can descend the screen to attack the player's ship. The player has to fight through a number of variations of the enemy. \n \nThe four skill levels are: \n \nLevel 1 - Alien fighters attack one at a time \nLevel 2 - Alien fighters attack one at a time but combat speed is faster \nLevel 3 - Alien fighters attack two at a time \nLevel 4 - Alien fighters attack two at a time but combat speed is faster \nThe game ends once either the player loses five ships or exceeds 9,999 points when a special electronic victory tune was played.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1]}
