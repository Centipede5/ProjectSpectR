This means that four players can play right away. \n \nThe game itself is set in the format of a TV gameshow with the contestants behind podiums. The questions appear on a jumbotron, introduced by the show's host: Buzz. The main game is split over eight rounds starting with simple game mechanics but getting gradually more complex and causing more competitiveness. The question types are general knowledge and cover a large amount of subjects using pictures, videos, music clips etc. \n \nAs well as the regular game, you can play an eight player game if you have a second set of buzzers. There's also team play and a quizmaster mode. There are two versions of the game; with or without a set of buzzers included.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75245,6080,101956,101659,100916,100909,100767,99181,95874,88903],"tags":[268435463],"category":0,"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1208131200000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1208131200000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Apr-14","y":2008,"m":4}]}
