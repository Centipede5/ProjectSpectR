This time around, a time-travelling machine threatens all of Japan and thus Goemon and co. must jump into the future to stop the machine. \n \nThe game alternates between a top-down world map view in which your characters explore the gameworld and side-scrolling stages in which the main action lies. As in most games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences such as maneuvering Goemon's giant mecha. \n \nThe game continues the tradition of bizarre humor unique to the series, you can play as either Goemon or any of his 3 companions, Ebisumaru, Sasuke or Yae with each sporting unique weapons and abilities and also with their own dialogue options and cutscenes, which feature sitcom-like pre-recorded laughs for added wackiness.","popularity":1,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":790214400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":790214400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jan-16","y":1995,"m":1}]}
