It is up to a covert organization, known only as Men In Black, to stop the invasion. You take the role of Agent J as he hunts down 12 different alien races, including the Skraaldians and the Fmeck. Luckily, J has a wide range of weapons to help him put an end to the alien menace; most notable is the Noisy Cricket. While most aliens are relatively easy to spot, some can change shape and will not reveal themselves until J gets close to them...so keep your eyes peeled. When a stage is cleared, you are treated to an animated sequence that advances the plot. Will the Agent J be able to save the world? Play MEN IN BLACK: The Series 2 and find out.","collection":4346,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,16468,23175,40524,59516,51464,28029,55289,68324],"tags":[1,536875054,536875259,536878439,536882366],"category":0,"keywords":[4142,4347,7527,11454],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":965779200000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":965779200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Aug-09","y":2000,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/udx3r55tot7re65psc9u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"udx3r55tot7re65psc9u","width":387,"height":500},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
