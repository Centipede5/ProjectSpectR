Engraved upon it are the words which form your destiny. For you are Arthur. the son and true heir to the High King, Uther Pendragon. \n \nBut there is more to asserting your claim than wresting free the sword. The sword in the stone disappears - stolen by the evil King Lot. To win it back, you must develop the kingly qualities of wisdom, chivalry and experience, qualities that will also prove you worthy of the throne. And you must do it all within three days, or Lot will usurp your legacy. \n \nYou are assisted by Merlin the Enchanter, who grants you the power to transform yourself into a variety of animals. Now you can explore the kingdom as no one has before: from the sky, from rivers and lakes, from on- and under- the earth. How you use this power, and how you solve the myriad puzzles that confront you, will determine your success in your quest. \n \nArthur: Quest for Excalibur adds an exciting new dimension to the timeless Arthurian tale while preserving all of its original richness and grandeur. \n \nCaptivating color graphics combine with the richness of Infocom's storytelling to bring you unforgettable entertainment. \n \nNow prepare to claim your birthright as king born of all England. It's your chance to live the legend.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[47823,37088,19289,36534,12198,18398,12328,13189,22425,7621],"tags":[17,22,268435487,536871130,536871138,536871179,536871180,536871208,536871939,536873308,536875067,536875074,536875172,536877148,536878077,536879216,1073741825,1073741829],"developers":[368],"publishers":[368],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[218,226,267,268,296,1027,2396,4155,4162,4260,6236,7165,8304],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[14,13,16,75],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v9jtlkvzkraooqphtrot.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v9jtlkvzkraooqphtrot","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e9jivigyfx7bzoqq3ldj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e9jivigyfx7bzoqq3ldj","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/swttglxhnrcgipd4mrbt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"swttglxhnrcgipd4mrbt","width":693,"height":891}}
