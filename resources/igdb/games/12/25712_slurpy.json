In every level, your goal is to eat ten floating seeds. Meanwhile, of course, the game does its best to prevent you from doing so, by throwing a multitude of different monsters against you. Fortunately nearly every monster in the game can be eaten as well. If an enemy touches Slurpy, you can kiss one of your precious lives goodbye; but woe to the enemy that strays in front of Slurpy's trunk and is caught by his amazing suction power!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36794,36608,34919,51485,22819,40524,51683,24199,23175,16468],"tags":[1,268435489,1073741826],"publishers":[11498],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[68,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ebqskteuqz10swntojow.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ebqskteuqz10swntojow","width":800,"height":1140}}
