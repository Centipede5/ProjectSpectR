{"id":3112,"name":"Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix","slug":"soldier-of-fortune-ii-double-helix","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/soldier-of-fortune-ii-double-helix","created_at":1383429113911,"updated_at":1546887693798,"summary":"Soldier of Fortune II: Double Helix is a video game created by Raven Software, a sequel to Soldier of Fortune. It was developed using the Quake III: Team Arena engine. Once again, Raven hired John Mullins to act as a consultant on the game. Based on comments and criticisms of the original game, Raven Software developed Soldier of Fortune II to be a more \"realistic\" game, with tactical shooters like Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six as inspirations rather than Quake. A sequel titled Soldier of Fortune: Payback, made by Cauldron HQ was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2007.","storyline":"The theme of the sequel is germ warfare, as the mercenary Mullins and his new partner Madeline Taylor travel to Colombia to investigate a viral outbreak in a small town, only to link it to a shadowy organization called Prometheus. The virus, called Romulus, is followed by a computer virus called Remus which is programmed to delete files on any computer in the world, in this case, files relating to Prometheus and Romulus, so an anti-virus cannot be formulated. Prometheus then plans to blackmail the G8 countries at a summit in Switzerland for billions of dollars. It is revealed throughout the course of the game that a mole inside The Shop may be feeding information to the terrorists.","collection":569,"rating":67.7131589950803,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":68,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":67.85657949754015,"total_rating_count":31,"rating_count":27,"games":[3111,241,281,1294,231,1851,316,4083,3113,6739],"tags":[1,39,268435461,536870913,536870920,536871041,536871044,536871213,536871365,536871378,536871470,536871791,536871937,536874743,536875095,536875098,536875171,536875249,536875257,536875322,536875358,536875420,536875483,536875526,536875609,536875625,536875672,536875682,536875771,536875787,536875804,536875814,536875868,536875901,536875902,536876068,536876221,536876261,536876262,536876355,536876356,536876378,536876406,536876423,536876441,536876477,536876587,536876642,536876685,536876701,536876725,536876804,536876914,536877208,536877210,536877223,536877226,536877227,536877239,536877282,536877283,536877286,536877326,536877373,536877512,536877540,536877605,536877645,536877741,536877834,536877950,536877952,536877961,536877964,536877966,536878002,536878011,536878400,536878410,536879028,536879584,536879626,536879678,536879707,536879718,536879871,536879893,536879996,536880066,536880222,536880290,536880639,536880725,536880813,536880818,536880960,536881281,536881289,536881290,536881514,536881525,536881539,536882158,536882337,536882926,536883035,536883086,536883629,536884030,536884473,536884954,536884955,536884956,536885892,536886484,1073741825],"developers":[71,1468,173],"publishers":[66,120],"game_engines":[56],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1,8,129,132,301,453,466,558,879,1025,3831,4183,4186,4259,4337,4345,4410,4446,4508,4571,4614,4697,4713,4760,4770,4859,4875,4892,4902,4956,4989,4990,5156,5309,5349,5350,5443,5444,5466,5494,5511,5529,5565,5675,5730,5773,5789,5813,5892,6002,6296,6298,6311,6314,6315,6327,6370,6371,6374,6414,6461,6600,6628,6693,6733,6829,6922,7038,7040,7049,7052,7054,7090,7099,7488,7498,8116,8672,8714,8766,8795,8806,8959,8981,9084,9154,9310,9378,9727,9813,9901,9906,10048,10369,10377,10378,10602,10613,10627,11246,11425,12014,12123,12174,12717,13118,13561,14042,14043,14044,14980,15572],"themes":[1,39],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1021852800000,"platforms":[6,14,11],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1021852800000,"region":2,"human":"2002-May-20","y":2002,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1022803200000,"region":1,"human":"2002-May-31","y":2002,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1055894400000,"region":2,"human":"2003-Jun-18","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1056067200000,"region":1,"human":"2003-Jun-20","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":1,"platform":14,"date":1030838400000,"region":2,"human":"2002-Sep","y":2002,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1036195200000,"region":1,"human":"2002-Nov-02","y":2002,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1056412800000,"region":5,"human":"2003-Jun-24","y":2003,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"SOFII\nSOF2","comment":"Other"},{"name":"SoF2","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"\u547d\u8fd0\u6218\u58ebII\uff1a\u53cc\u91cd\u87ba\u65cb","comment":"Chinese title"},{"name":"\u0421\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0442 \u0423\u0434\u0430\u0447\u0438 2","comment":"Russian title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tkc5db0feenphfrxsyat.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tkc5db0feenphfrxsyat","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j8p3n7wkmggsvbtexazm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j8p3n7wkmggsvbtexazm","width":1600,"height":1200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/saatwsg2racwlmpphh4v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"saatwsg2racwlmpphh4v","width":630,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ttlz2liude6n29lnnn8i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ttlz2liude6n29lnnn8i","width":351,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.ravensoftware.com\/games\/soldier-of-fortune-double-helix\/view-game\/"}]}
