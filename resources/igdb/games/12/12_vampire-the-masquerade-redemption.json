The game depicts Christof's centuries-long journey from the Dark Ages of 12th century Prague and Vienna to modern-day London and New York City in search of his humanity and his kidnapped love, the nun Anezka. \n \nThe game is presented in the first- and third-person perspectives. The player controls Christof and up to three allies through a linear structure, providing the player with missions to progress through a set narrative. Certain actions committed by Christof throughout the game can raise or lower his humanity, affecting which of the game's three endings the player receives. \n \nThe game includes multiplayer gameplay called \"Storyteller\", which allows one player to create a narrative for a group of players with the ability to modify the game dynamically in reaction to the players' actions.","storyline":"Before your fall, you led a crusade against evil. Now you've become one of the undead creatures you once battled - a Vampire. Inhabiting the World of Darkness, you must face a series of brutal confrontations with your nemesis Vukodlak, a powerful vampire lord. \n \nYour unholy showdown begins in medieval Europe and rages on into the modern day, as you track a soulless enemy in an eternal struggle to destroy him. For this is the only hope of vengeance for your tortured immortality.","collection":15,"rating":77.4266037547777,"popularity":7.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":68.71330187738886,"total_rating_count":26,"rating_count":24,"games":[2933,11,14394,22387,5550,68441,28168,34155,1593,76],"tags":[1,17,19,22,268435468,268435487,536871063,536871117,536871123,536871139,536871208,536871390,536871938,536872032,536872225,536872232,536872435,536873066,536873079,536873154,536873176,536873949,536875044,536875067,536875133,536875162,536875196,536875255,536875257,536875304,536875358,536875372,536875455,536875531,536875762,536875830,536876301,536876476,536876578,536876660,536877144,536877283,536877338,536877531,536878002,536878005,536878349,536878359,536878494,536880625,536880650,536880693,536880925,536881374,536881456,536881600,536882359,536883079,536883849,536884031,536885949,536886402,536886403,536886404,536886405,536886406,536886407,536886409,536886410,536886411,1073741826,1073741827],"developers":[182],"publishers":[66],"game_engines":[100],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[151,205,211,227,296,478,1026,1120,1313,1320,1523,2154,2167,2242,2264,3037,4132,4155,4221,4250,4284,4343,4345,4392,4446,4460,4543,4619,4850,4918,5389,5564,5666,5748,6232,6371,6426,6619,7090,7093,7437,7447,7582,9713,9738,9781,10013,10462,10544,10688,11447,12167,12937,13119,15037,15490,15491,15492,15493,15494,15495,15497,15498,15499],"themes":[1,17,19,22],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":960336000000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":960336000000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jun-07","y":2000,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":960336000000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jun-07","y":2000,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f8nncndknc4w58tl0mtb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f8nncndknc4w58tl0mtb","width":710,"height":444},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a4mwudvv4m48tyrudqya.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a4mwudvv4m48tyrudqya","width":710,"height":444},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kwjpkveqcyqfyff1lpzi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kwjpkveqcyqfyff1lpzi","width":710,"height":444},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tw9gem5f0jikewah6sgq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tw9gem5f0jikewah6sgq","width":710,"height":444},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bbdclm8m5c6iuiwra5d6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bbdclm8m5c6iuiwra5d6","width":710,"height":444}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"rs48k02AbLg"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"jlB4umW0CT4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pv3lwzul5sj5eskpzgrg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pv3lwzul5sj5eskpzgrg","width":655,"height":650},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_%E2%80%93_Redemption"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/vtmr.wikia.com\/wiki\/Vampire:_The_Masquerade_-_Redemption_Wiki"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/559680"}],"external":{"steam":"559680"}}
