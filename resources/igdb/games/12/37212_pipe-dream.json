The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished. \n \nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"keywords":[1299,1495,1563,2875,3782,4374,4819,5436,6048,7415,8100],"genres":[9,15],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pipe Mania","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xwywi7pdba572bpgeljk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xwywi7pdba572bpgeljk","width":1534,"height":2100}}
