Players can assume control over dragons, knights, spirits, and other fantasy creatures that engage in grid-based combat. Characters use swords, spears, and elemental attacks (e.g., lightning bolts, fireballs, volcanic eruptions) to defeat enemy units; damage is indicated by a loss of hit points. Cutscenes depict other instances of violence: creatures punching, slashing, or stomping on each other; a chained prisoner getting stabbed with a sword. During the course of the game, the dialogue occasionally references suggestive\/sexual material (e.g., \u201cpregnant from Gerhart's brutality,\u201d \u201cYou were an imp sucking succubus teats,\u201d and \u201cThe Empire bartered me to a rapist for political ends.\u201d).
