Protected by benevolent deities, it flourished until a disaster came: a demon destroyed the kingdom, and it disappeared off the face of the earth. But a few chosen ones, called \"Feathers\", continued to keep sacred gemstones, which allowed them to use unique powers in the fight against the demonic army. Each Feather protects a gem, and the protector of the Ruby gem is the protagonist of the game - an ordinary high school boy from our modern world who at first wants nothing to do with ancient prophecies and heroic deeds. But as he receives new power from the leader of the Feathers, he understands that his destiny is to fight evil, and perhaps restore Eternal Feather to its former glory.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55036,29173,55803,25311,55590,23345,19376,19847,70861,19301],"tags":[268435471,268435487,536870990,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[78,3782],"genres":[15,31],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ldpkmmdeftqhal6gazbr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ldpkmmdeftqhal6gazbr","width":640,"height":631}}
