{"id":16287,"name":"Slime Rancher","slug":"slime-rancher","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/slime-rancher","created_at":1452850904856,"updated_at":1541510187361,"summary":"Slime Rancher is the tale of Beatrix LeBeau, a plucky, young rancher who sets out for a life a thousand light years away from Earth on the \u2018Far, Far Range\u2019 where she tries her hand at making a living wrangling slimes. With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner. \n\n\nSlime Rancher is a first-person, sandbox experience where players will solve problems and survive through mastery of their vacpack: a vacuum\/cannon\/backpack that can vacuum up and blast out anything that isn\u2019t nailed to the ground. \n\nEach day will present new challenges to players as they attempt to amass a great fortune in the business of slime ranching. While players are free to approach these challenges however they wish, a typical day might look like this: \n\n*You wake at the crack of dawn and get to watering the crops at the ranch. Some slimes are vegetarian, after all. Then it\u2019s time to gather up the plumpest hens from the chicken coop. Some slimes are totally not vegetarian, after all. \n\n*Next, you\u2019re off to feed slimes their breakfast over at the slime corrals so they don\u2019t get too out of hand during the day. Hungry slimes get jumpy. Jumpy slimes can\u2019t be contained. \n\n*With your ranch set for the day, it\u2019s time to begin exploring the untamed wilds of the Far, Far Range. Along the way, you\u2019ll encounter slimes you\u2019ve never seen before, discover a new type of veggie to cultivate back at the ranch, and narrowly avoid certain doom in a valley of burly, feral slimes. \n\n*With the sun setting, it\u2019s time to head back to the ranch, rustle up some dinner for your slimes, and try and figure out just how the heck you\u2019ll keep these new slimes that seem to, well, explode all the time. \n\n*But you can do this. You had the courage to travel a thousand light years away from home to make a living as a slime rancher. Slimes that go boom? No problem. Slimes that burn with a radioactive aura? Bring it on. Slimes that wiggle their butts? Wait, do slimes even have butts?","rating":71.541087536862,"popularity":9.333333333333334,"aggregated_rating":77.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":74.60387710176434,"total_rating_count":23,"rating_count":19,"games":[25076,36950,25311,19249,29004,55038,25300,8347,62151,17112],"tags":[1,18,38,268435461,268435469,268435487,268435488,536870984,536871365,536871799,536871874,536871882,536871939,536872070,536872299,536875060,536875173,536875269,536875313,536875937,536882999,536883021,536883468,536887738,1073741825],"developers":[8024],"publishers":[16242,8024],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[72,453,887,962,970,1027,1158,1387,4148,4261,4357,4401,5025,12087,12109,12556,16826],"themes":[1,18,38],"genres":[5,13,31,32],"first_release_date":1452729600000,"pulse_count":32,"platforms":[6,14,48,49,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1534809600000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Aug-21","y":2018,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1501545600000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Aug-01","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1501545600000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Aug-01","y":2017,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1452729600000,"human":"2016-Jan-14","y":2016,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1452729600000,"human":"2016-Jan-14","y":2016,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1452729600000,"human":"2016-Jan-14","y":2016,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wulzviic41uspwm72y9c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wulzviic41uspwm72y9c","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j6x3lruoo2jchvcwxxv4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j6x3lruoo2jchvcwxxv4","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o6npdo80h3pc0zbwuy0d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o6npdo80h3pc0zbwuy0d","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dxvgdomjfxzh358dmaln.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dxvgdomjfxzh358dmaln","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nrxoirx7cdlzaphzix2k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nrxoirx7cdlzaphzix2k","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"iAfP-JCjrmc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qmfhgqdtb16vh0vek5b6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qmfhgqdtb16vh0vek5b6","width":720,"height":1080},"esrb":{"rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game was rated PEGI 3 because it features occasional, very mild violence in a comical or abstract context.","rating":1},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Slime_Rancher"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/slimerancher.wikia.com\/wiki\/Slime_Rancher_Wiki"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/433340"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/slimerancher.com"}],"external":{"steam":"433340"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
