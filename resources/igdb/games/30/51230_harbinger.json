Survivors are taken aboard the havoc-wreaking ship to work in labor camps, or be unluckily sent off to the laboratories for vicious tests and experiments that often lead to insanity. Few have managed to escape into the deep, forgotten wasteland levels of the ship, where an underground society exists. They search for a means of escape while fighting for their survival with anything they can scavenge as they attempt to ward off the relentless patrols sent for them.","popularity":1,"games":[36950,25300,68287,71455,26766,28029,64204,27314,25311,19448],"tags":[1,18,536871882,536871938,536875361],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1026,4449],"themes":[1,18],"first_release_date":1017014400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1017014400000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Mar-25","y":2002,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qwnno1epuewvwa5a4w8m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qwnno1epuewvwa5a4w8m","width":354,"height":500}}
