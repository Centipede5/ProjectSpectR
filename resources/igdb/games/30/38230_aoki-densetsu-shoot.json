(\u84bc\u304d\u4f1d\u8aac\u3000\u30b7\u30e5\u30fc\u30c8!?, lit. \"Blue Legend Shoot!\") is a Japanese anime produced by Toei Animation between November 9, 1990 and December 22, 1991 on the Fuji TV television network; there were fifty-eight episodes. The game has an exhibition mode, an anime-style story mode, and a variety of options, which is entirely in Japanese, so literacy in this language is strongly recommended for quality gameplay. Once the game begins, the action progresses in a side view, similar to an arcade soccer game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[51464,78088,65009,65118,18681,70861,47865,27081,28862,65659],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536870990,536875053,536875054,536875282,536875433],"category":0,"keywords":[26,78,4141,4142,4370,4521],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":790214400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":790214400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jan-16","y":1995,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fl0sbtjmdhnpmadpyrlw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fl0sbtjmdhnpmadpyrlw","width":826,"height":1470}}
