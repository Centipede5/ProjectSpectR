Where this one stands out, however, is the setting of your character as a duck called Bin, and with motion having a clear waddling appearance. The enemies to fight are all from the animal kingdom, but somewhat warped - crocodiles with boxing moves and cows armed with rocket packs for example. Bin has six levels to clear before he can rescue Lucy from Archaca's clutches.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[101257,26820,76253,100934,99307,38280,36794,36780,96414,41828],"tags":[268435460,268435481,268435489,536871075,1073741826],"developers":[830],"publishers":[11739,66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[163],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[4,25,33],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[52,63,16,15,26,25,64],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":64,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":631065600000,"region":5,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Dynamite Dux"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tgva5dhpjm0woqkjahgq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tgva5dhpjm0woqkjahgq","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dl8lu1mbgdpmtvhtmvyt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dl8lu1mbgdpmtvhtmvyt","width":754,"height":1045}}
