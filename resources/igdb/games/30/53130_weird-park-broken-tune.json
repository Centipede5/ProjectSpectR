Players solve puzzles and search through screens of jumbled objects to advance the storyline. Some sequences contain dark imagery: a shackled character tied to a chair, a pentagram next to a doll embedded with needles. Newspaper clippings sometimes reference deadly events: \"Several Die in Rollercoaster Catastrophe\" and \"A worker . . . was knocked unconscious as he fell into the pond, and drowned.\" During the course of the game, a handful of tobacco-related products (e.g., cigars, smoking pipes) are included as searchable items. The word \"damned\" appears in the dialogue.","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":3}}
