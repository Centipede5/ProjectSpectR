Seeking the cause behind this, the dwarf fights his way to the local temple, and finds the answers - and his money - deep down in the crypts. \n \nGameplay is similar. Cadaver: The Payoff has only four levels, but they are significantly larger than those of the first game, and the second level has a large number of monsters and scant possibilities to heal.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36926,47823,26766,12632,25300,59516,55289,36534,25311,18398],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536871208,536871878,536871938,536872257,536872617,536875050],"category":0,"keywords":[296,966,1026,1345,1705,4138],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":16,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gnj9bf2a5h3upl5qkvbf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gnj9bf2a5h3upl5qkvbf","width":270,"height":275}}
