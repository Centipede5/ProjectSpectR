And to top that, you have plenty of new moves, counterattacks, powerups, and key combinations to use. \n \nWhereas Cotton 2 was more of a tactical shooter (whenever that is applicable to the game) with its chain combo and life\/experience system, Cotton Boomerang is an all-out shooter due to the added moves, different level layout, and generally faster and crazier gameplay.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":886291200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":886291200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}]}
