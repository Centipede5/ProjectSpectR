The game and puzzles are quite absurd, but strangely addictive. Some inside scoop from developer Naughty Dog's website: \"Keef was a classic sword and scorcery role-playing game. While we were making it, Andy entered sarcastic text as a place holder for what we believed would be the real text in the final release. EA liked the humor so much that they decided to make the entire game a comedy. The effect that this decision had on sales was no joke, however.\"","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36926,12632,47823,16468,17583,36534,27209,11169,55092,11567],"tags":[1,17,268435468,536871086,536871208,536871327,536871390,536871506,536871938,536875242,536875258,536875330,536875525,536875540,536875822,536875870,536876429,536876617,1073741827,1073741825],"developers":[401],"publishers":[1],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[174,296,415,478,594,1026,4330,4346,4418,4613,4628,4910,4958,5517,5705],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[115,13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":115,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":8,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d2oapal9gnfybjh6muil.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d2oapal9gnfybjh6muil","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o5vqrepyqaxfpgrx8tbv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o5vqrepyqaxfpgrx8tbv","width":640,"height":841}}
