You can make your samurai shoot, use a screen-clearing bomb and perform a slash with his sword. The slash move forms the core of Homura's gameplay, as by slashing enemy bullets, you can send them back at the enemy. Homura features multi-form bosses and four stages of play, with stages one through three branching off into multiple paths. The game is based on an arcade title.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[55036,95340,60044,107226,32510,29173,79080,77597,36553,55590],"tags":[268435461,268435465,268435471,536873787,536874694,536876055],"developers":[2116],"category":0,"keywords":[166],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1135987200000,"platforms":[52,8],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":1135987200000,"region":5,"human":"2005","y":2005,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1152230400000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Jul-07","y":2006,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c2qndd4tijwxxqu8p96v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c2qndd4tijwxxqu8p96v","width":480,"height":640}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pdktojttalmahmfmmv1j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pdktojttalmahmfmmv1j","width":438,"height":620}}
