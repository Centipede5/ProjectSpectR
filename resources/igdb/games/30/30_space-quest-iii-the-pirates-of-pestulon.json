Software Authors Pirated? \n \nThe Two Guys from Andromeda, designers of the graphically extravagant (and satirically sensational) Space Quest series, have disappeared into this oxygen! Hysterical game fanatics around the world await word on the whereabouts of these celestial celebrities! \n \nWho could be the mastermind behind this evil plot? \n \nCould it be the Pirates of Pestulon, known for their plundering, preying and unprincipled practices? Or maybe the legions of Space Quest fans who would kill to be the first to play Space Quest III (the graphic adventure game with the closest thing yet to motion picture-quality animation). Not to be forgotten are the monkey-suited minions of Sludge Vohaul (from our last episode), who would love to make banana pudding out of those responsible for putting them behind bars. \n \nWho are the dirty deed doers behind our daring duo's demise? Is it too late to save the two guys from a disgusting and downright despicable doom? \n \nHoly SpaceWaste, space adventurers, find out for yourself as Roger Wilco, intergalactic garbagemen, returns to the rescue!","storyline":"Roger Wilco's escape pod from the end of Space Quest II is floating in space until it is picked up by an automated garbage freighter. Finding a derelict spaceship amongst the freighter's garbage, Roger sets out to repair the Aluminum Mallard and leave the scow. \n \nRoger visits a variety of locations, including a fast food restaurant called Monolith Burger and a desert planet called Phleebhut. At the latter, he encounters trouble, as Arnoid the Annihilator (an Arnold Schwarzenegger-like android terminator) hunts him for not paying for a whistle in Space Quest II (a continuity error in that the order form for the whistle clearly stated that it was in fact free). From information he picks up there and at Monolith Burger, Roger eventually discovers the sinister activities of a video game company known as ScumSoft, run by the \"Pirates of Pestulon\". \n \nPestulon, a small moon of the volcanic planet Ortega, is covered in soft, moss-like vegetation, and dotted with twisted tree-like growths throughout. Elmo Pug, the CEO of ScumSoft, has abducted the Two Guys from Andromeda and is forcing them to design awful games. \n \nRoger manages to sneak into the supposedly impregnable ScumSoft building and rescue the two programmers. He is discovered, and must battle Pug in a game that combines giant Mecha-style combat with Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots. After winning, Roger and the Two Guys escape. In the game's conclusion, Roger delivers the two game designers to Sierra On-Line's president, Ken Williams, on Earth.","collection":8,"rating":80.22229281246081,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":80.22229281246081,"total_rating_count":11,"rating_count":11,"games":[11122,86657,25222,8762,15537,18011,36950,27762,15911,13524],"tags":[18,27,268435458,268435465,268435487,536870915,536871262,536871470,536871878,536871882,536871939,536872328,536872552,536872617,536872983,536875094,536875265,536875310,536875358,536875389,536876326,536876692,536876883,536877316,536877501,536878077,536879186,536879191,536879765,536880164,536880747,1073741826],"developers":[32],"publishers":[32],"game_engines":[534],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3,350,558,966,970,1027,1416,1640,1705,2071,4182,4353,4398,4446,4477,5414,5780,5971,6404,6589,7165,8274,8279,8853,9252,9835],"themes":[18,27],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[63,14,13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":694137600000,"region":2,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Space Quest 3","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/comofy8s01uvfaga4i4x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"comofy8s01uvfaga4i4x","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zwz2s27qr1xelptxx182.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zwz2s27qr1xelptxx182","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f0jgcykrmglo9sxe8qo0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f0jgcykrmglo9sxe8qo0","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hvetuplrrkwcnrruw0xb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hvetuplrrkwcnrruw0xb","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xzbgzc1rfqnfevhicpgz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xzbgzc1rfqnfevhicpgz","width":320,"height":200}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameintro","video_id":"_rqbtvGpmp8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qphcv1stubp0loolvh3s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qphcv1stubp0loolvh3s","width":639,"height":800},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Space_Quest_III"}]}
