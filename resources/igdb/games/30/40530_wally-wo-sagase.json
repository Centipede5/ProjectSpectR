(Where's Waldo? in the US) media franchise. You use a trackball to find Wally in a number of different ways (catching him in an animation, finding him in a door, finding him with only a small portion of the screen visible at a time, etc.). It is only known to have been released in Japan, however most people use the translated name Where's Wally!; whether or not there was an overseas release is unknown (TODO find proof).","collection":3713,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[25222,19289,60,27314,19448,26766,236,25300,57436,37088],"tags":[17,18,22,27,268435465,268435487,536871262,536871882,536871939,536872282,536873787,536875067],"category":0,"keywords":[350,970,1027,1370,2875,4155],"themes":[17,18,22,27],"genres":[9,31],"first_release_date":707356800000,"platforms":[52,19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":730080000000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Feb-19","y":1993,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":707356800000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jun-01","y":1992,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Wally wo Sagase!","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x52lqzw7huza20wcxrss.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x52lqzw7huza20wcxrss","width":213,"height":384}}
