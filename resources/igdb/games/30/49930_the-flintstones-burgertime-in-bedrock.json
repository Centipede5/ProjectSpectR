{"id":49930,"name":"The Flintstones: BurgerTime in Bedrock","slug":"the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/the-flintstones-burgertime-in-bedrock","created_at":1500034366922,"updated_at":1516166248821,"summary":"The restaurant business meets prehistoric times in this combination of classic video gaming and old-fashioned cartoon mayhem. Mr. Slate has purchased himself a Brontoburger chain, and Fred has been saddled with the unenviable task of playing chef. It seems that the restaurant has come with a pre-existing problem, though: pests! Run from counter to counter, trying to build sandwiches for the hungry customers, avoiding attacks from the flying beasties all the while. Interestingly, the kitchen is also outfitted with a bunch of platforms and ladders which means you'll have your share of climbing to tackle as well. Lose all of your lives and you're out of a job (resulting in more time at home with the ingratiating Bam-Bam). The graphics and humor are perfect representations of the original cartoon, and the game plays much like the coin-operated BURGERTIME. Play alone or use a link cable to hook up with a friend to see who has the fastest food preparation skills in Bedrock.","collection":3101,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[71541,34919,36608,16468,51464,23175,59516,28029,55289,10039],"tags":[1,536870999,536871519,536875054,536875094,536875259,536875292,536876694],"category":0,"keywords":[87,607,4142,4182,4347,4380,5782],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":993859200000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":993859200000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jun-30","y":2001,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qskgi5b031zid3xtzwyo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qskgi5b031zid3xtzwyo","width":150,"height":150},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
