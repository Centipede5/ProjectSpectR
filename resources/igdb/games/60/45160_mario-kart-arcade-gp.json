Designed for the Triforce arcade board (also used for F-Zero AX), players can race as one of eleven characters on twenty-four tracks. On certain machines, for an additional fee, a player's data can be saved on a magnetic card which can be inserted into the machine again later to retain unlocked items and records. Nintendo's limited role of development was mainly isolated to ensuring that it was a worthy title for the established franchise. \n \nThis game's arcade cabinet houses a camera that will take a photograph of the player's face. The photo can be customized and then will be displayed above the player's character during multiplayer races. \n \nThe game is noted for being the first Mario Kart to feature playable crossover characters: Namco's Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man and Blinky. The game's sequel also featured Mametchi, a character from the Tamagotchi games. The third installment included Don from the Taiko no Tatsujin franchise.","collection":449,"rating":50,"popularity":3.333333333333333,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[39342,2332,2342,2343,2349,2345,1193,2350,3772,1192],"tags":[1,268435466,536870937,536871958,536871987,536872293,536872590,536872594,536872656,536873024,536873064,536873671,536874539,536874824,536874900,536875056,536875069,536875082,536875091,536875128,536875130,536875215,536875233,536875236,536875392,536875421,536875494,536875569,536875715,536875955,536876214,536876266,536876698,536876788,536876790,536876871,536876899,536877066,536877086,536877088,536877097,536877116,536877119,536877120,536877280,536877627,536877677,536877710,536877744,536877982,536878434,536879791,536881354,536883715],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"keywords":[25,1046,1075,1381,1678,1682,1744,2112,2152,2759,3627,3912,3988,4144,4157,4170,4179,4216,4218,4303,4321,4324,4480,4509,4582,4657,4803,5043,5302,5354,5786,5876,5878,5959,5987,6154,6174,6176,6185,6204,6207,6208,6368,6715,6765,6798,6832,7070,7522,8879,10442,12803],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1131753600000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1131753600000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Nov-12","y":2005,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Mario Kart Arcade Grand Prix","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g7chrjw1llqdx9zuphjt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g7chrjw1llqdx9zuphjt","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bcbww1ltseo2qlokt56j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bcbww1ltseo2qlokt56j","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jallbspbrzn3s4p8k8ps.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jallbspbrzn3s4p8k8ps","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/okwpwoarcnofmlnlopah.jpg","cloudinary_id":"okwpwoarcnofmlnlopah","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b5vsvcfqjj9iwyrvzoxa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b5vsvcfqjj9iwyrvzoxa","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/whfqka47w7yqlu8djjbn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"whfqka47w7yqlu8djjbn","width":400,"height":300},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/atyudco1wfgnin9n2pld.jpg","cloudinary_id":"atyudco1wfgnin9n2pld","width":400,"height":300}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wdkczastz2pptd2wwgsi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdkczastz2pptd2wwgsi","width":400,"height":427}}
