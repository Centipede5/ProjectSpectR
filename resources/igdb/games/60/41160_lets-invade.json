For one thing, the aliens won't move down after completely moving across the screen, they have their own behavior. This game involves retro arcade gaming, with a twist of psychedelic aural (thumping trance) and visual stimulation. \n \nYou have been transported to a void by the alien mothership. Your mission is to battle wave after wave against the RGB invaders. The darker the aliens are, the weaker they will become. The lighter the aliens, the more hits they will require. You must blast away through 40 different stages. Shoot orange aliens for random power ups. Purple\/Magenta aliens give out extra lives.These will be lost if a life is lost, or the power up has timed out.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1480291200000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":1480291200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Nov-28","y":2016,"m":11}]}
