In fact, its play controls are among the most sophisticated in a PC Engine game and in general, in a tennis game (what still counts to this very day). Don't get fooled by its simple graphics. There is everything in this game that tennis is about. Smashes, stop balls, volleys, back and forehand spins or lobs. At the top of it all, you can play it in every thinkable player combination (training, tournament, 1-4 players). By the way: in addition, its one of the best multiplayer games ever.","collection":3753,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[81410,63156,49349,43605,42264,69361,61246,57712,56894,48214],"tags":[268435470,536871223,536875176,536875177],"category":0,"keywords":[311,4264,4265],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":667785600000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":667785600000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Mar-01","y":1991,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":670464000000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Apr-01","y":1991,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h0er30zm0ifoidh93zpu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h0er30zm0ifoidh93zpu","width":1114,"height":1080}}
