He visits the \"Devil Museum\" and meets a girl inside, but a sudden earthquake cuts their meeting short. The boy recites the incantation from the fortune-telling show said to \"capture the heart of the girl of his dreams\", but the incantation destroys the seal on a vase containing the devil. \n \nThe reanimated devil takes control of the boy's body, leaving the boy trapped in the devil's decaying body. He chases the devil to the house of Dr. Simon, a physics scientist hiding from the media.
