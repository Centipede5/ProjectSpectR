This hilarious and brutal parody of professional American football will introduce you to some of the wildest, most bloodthirsty superstar players to ever strap on shoulder spikes. Players such as JJ. Rott and Troll Gonnamaulu lead stranglehold defenses against the punishing offenses of Tom Brainy, Jamaul Gnarls, and Ghoulio Bones. Mutant Football League features deep strategy, over-the-top violence, laugh-out-loud gross-out humor, and of course those signature Dirty Trick plays. Thirty monstrous teams are made up of skeletons, battlebots, trolls, aliens, super-humans, and demons. There are very few rules in The MFL, so get ready to do all the punching and crunching, biting and fighting, and stomping and chomping necessary to become the MVP (Most Vicious Player) of the Mayhem Bowl, and take home the Vic Lobotomi Trophy.","collection":3873,"rating":80,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":65,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":72.5,"total_rating_count":2,"rating_count":0,"games":[15851,23733,18869,14760,95028,37419,85382,103341,100359,20329],"tags":[1,27,268435470,268435488,536870938,536870939,536871262,536871487,536872234,536875060,536875066,536875609,536875794,536876291,1073741826],"developers":[8584],"publishers":[8584],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[26,27,350,575,1322,4148,4154,4697,4882,5379],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[14,32],"first_release_date":1509408000000,"pulse_count":18,"platforms":[6,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1509408000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Oct-31","y":2017,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1516320000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-19","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1516320000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Jan-19","y":2018,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i5c8tp8qfxe9y0wz7klu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i5c8tp8qfxe9y0wz7klu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pwcnv7ifovy772vtaexq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pwcnv7ifovy772vtaexq","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kiqxfwgfjvrmz1rggfwh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kiqxfwgfjvrmz1rggfwh","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lgxwwgigtfwhqsvtvnte.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lgxwwgigtfwhqsvtvnte","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iecekdsu2vvdvvlnzk9i.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iecekdsu2vvdvvlnzk9i","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"UPUqcL1MDSA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zvcwf0le9wmrbyfm37d3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zvcwf0le9wmrbyfm37d3","width":2347,"height":1568},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a sports-action game in which players engage in arcade-style games of football with monsters and mutants. In addition to calling plays and assigning skills, players can use a variety of attacks to kill their opponent's team members.

Gameplay contains frequent splashes of blood, as well as decapitations\/dismemberments with certain weapons. In-game commentary contains frequent instances of mature humor, sometimes suggestive\/sexual in nature: \u201cWell if you are into humiliation and scatological fetishes, this Burns loss was right up your alley\u201d; \u201cThese teams couldn't score in a brothel\u201d; \u201cBrick's was almost involved in a threesome but his left hand fell asleep.\u201d Some commentary also contains references to marijuana, pot brownies and cookies, cocaine, meth, and crack.
