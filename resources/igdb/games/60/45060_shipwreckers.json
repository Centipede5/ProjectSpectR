Viewed from a top-down overhead perspective, Shipwreckers! is an offbeat, comical adventure. As you navigate the myriad of puzzles, traps and challenges found in the game, keep a sharp eye out for map bottles floating throughout each of the five exotic locales, which allow you to exit each world. At your disposal is an arsenal of weird and wonderful weapons, ranging from traditional cannonballs to magical bolts of lightning.","popularity":1,"games":[65832,19083,19934,11588,29173,76731,25311,76098,21642,23345],"tags":[1,27,268435471,536870916,536871262,536871776,536872010,536872649,536874694,536874743,536875477,536875699,536883622],"category":0,"keywords":[4,350,864,1098,1737,3782,3831,4565,4787,12710],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":880934400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":880934400000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Dec-01","y":1997,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Overboard!","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/av4nfawcstrzczckc5vq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"av4nfawcstrzczckc5vq","width":1416,"height":1415},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
