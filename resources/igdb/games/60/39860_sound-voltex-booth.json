DJ YOSHITAKA serves as the head producer. \nSota Fujimori provides all of the games' background musics (in SOUND VOLTEX III GRAVITY WARS, under his Expander alias). \nWhat makes SOUND VOLTEX different from the other game series is that regular BEMANI artists (either KONAMI in-house or commissioned ones) aren't involved in the song list, with a few exceptions. It, instead, involves artists renowned in the doujin and beatmania simulation scene, plus licensed EXIT TUNES songs and Touhou Project arrangements. There are also remixes of original KONAMI songs. \nWhile at first the song list mostly consisted of original songs or licenses involving VOCALOID, later in the life-cycle of the first game the artist selection greatly expanded thanks to what it is supposed to be the most important part of the series - the FLOOR section.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75245,6080,101956,101659,100916,100909,100767,99181,95874,88903],"tags":[268435463],"category":0,"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1361145600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1361145600000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Feb-18","y":2013,"m":2}]}
