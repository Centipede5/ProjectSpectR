Presented in the same 2D visual style as the animated TV show, the game allows players to defend the town and its surrounding environs from wave after wave of whimsical enemies. Hippies, \"crab people,\" terrorists, \"jackovasaurs,\" demons, and Mongolians attack, while the  South Park  kids barrage them with snowballs. The snowballs cause enemies to catch on fire, burst into a pile of flying limbs, get dismembered, and splatter blood on the ground.   As players progress through the game, they can unlock episode clips from a scrapbook menu. Clips include frequent instances of mature humor: jokes about hemorrhoids; a child masturbating a dog; characters exchanging money for pubic hair; a child who says, \"I really want to stick my p*nis in your v*gina\"; raised middle fingers; racial\/ethnic stereotypes (e.g., thick Japanese accents, a black character described as \"smooth as chocolate\"); and jokes about sixth graders discussing a pornographic film called  Back Door Sl*ts 9 . Strong profanity (e.g., \"mother*cker,\"\"sh*t,\"\"d*ck,\" and \"a*shole\") can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":4,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
