The player takes the role of Wally, who has gone to bed for the night and has to wake up early in the morning for work. Unfortunately, his alarm clock has not been wound, and thus he will sleep late in the morning, and his boss will fire him. However, in his sleep, Wally's consciousness travels around his home, and other places, wearing his pyjamas, in search for the key to rewind the alarm clock and wake himself up.","collection":1769,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[23175,55752,25222,25646,47823,37094,25300,28154,19289,51485],"tags":[1,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871945,536872064,536872961,536873787,536875331,536875359,536875420,536875942,536876353,1073741828],"developers":[11770],"publishers":[11770],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1033,1152,2049,2875,4419,4447,4508,5030,5441],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,9,31],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/batpm3utedqhiqruatny.jpg","cloudinary_id":"batpm3utedqhiqruatny","width":1000,"height":1623}}
