From a top-down perspective, players use laser blasters, gun turrets, and flamethrowers to defeat the 'cartoony' insects (e.g., ants, scorpions, beetles, spiders). The somewhat frenetic combat is accompanied by laser sounds and colorful light effects; enemies break apart and disappear amid green splashes that briefly stain the ground. In one cutscene, an insect attack leaves brightly colored goo on a character's clothes.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.atari.com\/centipedeinfestation"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":5,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
