The Spanish press the attack in the Yucatan against the fierce Maya and Aztec nations. The Germans put all their efforts into finding the legendary El Dorado. The Pontiac Uprising ends in a terrifying bloodbath between Native Americans and the British. And the Russians will do anything to conquer Alaska at the cost of the Haida. Lead armies of thousands of troops to victory in large-scale battles in 10 missions. \n \nBoth games are a real treat for any strategy fan. But this is not a standard RTS, there is no simple build-send-and-forget here because even the biggest army can be defeated by a well coordinated, but relatively small force. Just like the old proverb says: \u201cAn army of sheep led by a lion would defeat an army of lions led by a sheep.\u201d","collection":1263,"rating":50,"popularity":5,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":1,"games":[596,30229,55036,55029,9059,9361,242,2950,78550,11814],"tags":[22,39,268435467,268435471,536870914,536871169,536871438,536871470,536871518,536871717,536871905,536871906,536872070,536872074,536872263,536874694,536875407,536875803,536876933,1073741827],"developers":[144],"publishers":[144,145],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[2,257,526,558,606,805,993,994,1158,1162,1351,3782,4495,4891,6021],"themes":[22,39],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":1062115200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1062115200000,"region":1,"human":"2003-Aug-29","y":2003,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1064793600000,"region":2,"human":"2003-Sep-29","y":2003,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1314316800000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Aug-26","y":2011,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u5f81\u670d\u7f8e\u6d32\uff1a\u62b5\u6297","comment":"Chinese title"},{"name":"\u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0435\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0410\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438: \u0412 \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0445 \u042d\u043b\u044c\u0434\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e","comment":"Russian title"},{"name":"American Conquest: Proti\u00fader","comment":"Czech title"},{"name":"American Conquest: Odwet","comment":"Polish title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lygqyhreefrvcr56wym6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lygqyhreefrvcr56wym6","width":1280,"height":960},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qapstbxy65zwkrl1sbvr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qapstbxy65zwkrl1sbvr","width":1280,"height":960},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q9uxwjxtxlzpzchwfqpt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q9uxwjxtxlzpzchwfqpt","width":1280,"height":1024},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w4s0atsil1o1xjrsubfr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w4s0atsil1o1xjrsubfr","width":1280,"height":1024},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rg6nqpe0vpir9qugisnc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rg6nqpe0vpir9qugisnc","width":1280,"height":1024}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ucnrdr3doqrgjqwv3u0d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ucnrdr3doqrgjqwv3u0d","width":640,"height":908},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/gsc-game.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/115220"}],"external":{"steam":"115220"}}
