Have my dreams of guzzling grog and plundering galleons been reduced to this? \"Three small trials and you're a pirate like us,\" they said. Fair enough. If only I could stomach the foul brew these scurvy seadogs swilled, the rest would be easy. How could I have known I'd meet a powerful and beautiful woman with a jealous suitor too stupid to realize he'd been dead for years? And how can I crawl through this great stone monkey to find a man who walks three inches above the ground and sets fire to his beard every morning? \n \nDo business with quaint and humble shopkeepers. Participate in complex and meaningful dialogues. Visit interesting places and steal stuff. Experience the never-ending nightlife of Melee Island.","storyline":"Guybrush Threepwood, a young man with desires to become a mighty pirate, travels to Melee Island, a pirate haven.
