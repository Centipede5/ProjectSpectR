{"id":28160,"name":"ATOM RPG","slug":"atom-rpg","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/atom-rpg","created_at":1492510687111,"updated_at":1523369258685,"summary":"Project ATOM RPG: A Post-nuclear RPG set in the Soviet Union is ready for launch on Kickstarter!  \n  \nWe are happy to announce that from April 18, 2017 (9:00 AM (EDT, UTC -4)) we are starting a crowdfunding Kickstarter campaign. Check it out!  \nhttps:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/atomrpg\/1740849003?token=e66fef53  \n  \nATOM RPG is a classic role-playing game with some adventure game mechanics. It is a respectful nod towards the games, books and movies which inspired us through the years, but with enough original ideas to keep the players interested in exploring our world.  \n  \nWe try to put as much detail as we can into our world, our stories, and our characters. Our main goals include creating unique portraits and dialogues for each NPC. The role-playing process is skill-driven, meaning dialogue options and ways to solve a quest depend on the set of abilities the player has. Making the game non-linear is a priority to: you can visit any location on the world map at any time. You can even kill key characters, and still have the possibility of beating the game.  \n  \nThe current alpha version includes: 21 quests, 37 characters, 16 kinds of random encounters (3 of which are unique), 5 major locations and more than 2000 lines of dialogue.","hypes":3,"rating":60,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[26145,59516,27922,44076,25300,49414,24048,36608,19541,16468],"tags":[21,268435468,536870981,536873337,536873354,1073741827],"developers":[12485],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,2425,2442],"themes":[21],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1518652800000,"status":4,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1518652800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Feb-15","y":2018,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1518652800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Feb-15","y":2018,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1518652800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Feb-15","y":2018,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sid2waygbciar4qtbeus.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sid2waygbciar4qtbeus","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ye96aqhavezun6shuz9n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ye96aqhavezun6shuz9n","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/muimvpirfymkzzzqsj5l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"muimvpirfymkzzzqsj5l","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cjtjdiphyoxqvaeryx6g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cjtjdiphyoxqvaeryx6g","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nio9yfiqwepl42y6mzaj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nio9yfiqwepl42y6mzaj","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"GHDneF8t-6o"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vl0v7xy4qpfbzvgpydzw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vl0v7xy4qpfbzvgpydzw","width":260,"height":360},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/atomrpg"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/atomrpg"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/552620"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/atomrpg.com"}],"external":{"steam":"552620"}}
