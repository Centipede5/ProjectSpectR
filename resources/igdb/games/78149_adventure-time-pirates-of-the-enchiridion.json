As players explore various kingdoms, they can interact with characters, interrogate suspicious figures, and engage in turn-based battles with enemies. Battles consist of players selecting attack moves from a menu as they attempt to deplete opponents' hit points\/health meters. Attacks are generally whimsical in nature (e.g., punches with an over-sized fist, conking an enemy on the head with an oar); some characters can also use swords, spears, or fireballs. One interrogation scene depicts a character emitting flatulence, indicated by a sound effect and a green gas cloud.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game was rated PEGI 7 for non-realistic violence in a child-friendly setting or context.
