Barely 24 hours ago, they penetrated the last defence line of our galaxy, the Arsion Laser Belt. Millions of innocent people perished in outer space colonies. 70% of our fleet was destroyed during first contact. Our intelligence has now extrapolated their arrival within six days. Conventional weapons cannot stop them. Our last hope is in your hands: The Z-42 Warpstar. Warp into their territories and destroy their leader before they reach Earth.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103298,103020,95340,103281,28029,32902,10039,90099,83728,36977],"tags":[1,268435461,536871113,536871859,536871971,536875358],"category":0,"keywords":[201,947,1059,4446],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1170201600000,"platforms":[136,23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":1170201600000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Jan-31","y":2007,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":1195430400000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Nov-19","y":2007,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e00wuvkryg58hfjbvtkn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e00wuvkryg58hfjbvtkn","width":360,"height":318}}
