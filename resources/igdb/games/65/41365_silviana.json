It was never released outside of Japan. \n \nSilviana (possibly Silvania) is an Action RPG where the goal is to follow the eponymous heroine on her quest to find medicine for her sick mother, and possibly locate her missing father in the process. \n \nThe game has a deliberately simplistic RPG system where there are no visible stats other the character's health and enemies are fought by simply walking into them to defeat them. Each defeated enemy also takes off a small amount of Silviana's health. In order to stay alive, Silviana must occasionally visit towns and replenish her health by drinking tea as well as upgrade her equipment to ensure survival against tougher enemies.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[54775,80916,28309,30245,27092,55092,55038,22747,29348,36198],"tags":[1,268435468,536871208,536871938,536872120,536872260,536875057],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,1208,1348,4145],"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":587174400000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":587174400000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Aug-10","y":1988,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":589852800000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Sep-10","y":1988,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sylviana","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rkng4wmdmgxsuwzutilg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rkng4wmdmgxsuwzutilg","width":835,"height":841}}
