As Lara, players explore caves and ruins, and use arrows, firearms (e.g., pistols, shotguns, machine guns), and bladed weapons to battle wild animals, human enemies, and demonic soldiers. During several sequences, Lara is depicted getting stabbed, beaten, strangled, or shot by enemies; these close-up deaths occur as fail scenarios, usually when players miss certain action cues. A handful of cutscenes also depict enemy characters shot at close range. Large blood-splatter effects occur when characters are hit; one level depicts a demonic lair covered in dismembered human corpses--scattered limbs and pools of blood are prominent. The game also includes drug references in a comic-book panel (e.g., \u201c[W]e got caught in a drug den shootout\u201d and \u201cBut drug money buys good lawyers\u201d). The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Strong language\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/tombraider.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tomb_Raider:_Definitive_Edition"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tomb_Raider_(2013_video_game)"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/store.na.square-enix.com\/product\/282130\/tomb-raider-definitive-edition"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":8,"offlinemax":0}]}
