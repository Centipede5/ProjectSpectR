No trick is too dirty when you're preparing for The Final Confrontation. Only the hardest armor, the most powerful engine and the biggest guns will see you through the ultimate battle against The Adversary. \n \nAnd when you feel you can't take it anymore, you can check out the underground market: Spiked bumpers, landmines, rocket fuel or sabotage can provide a way to create some nasty accidents for the competition. \n \nDeath Rally was remade for IOS and Android in 2012, by fellow Finnish company Mountain Sheep. Remedy Entertainment stayed on board with the publishing.","collection":2072,"rating":76.5676968410259,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":68.28384842051295,"total_rating_count":21,"rating_count":20,"games":[3772,90101,22978,54775,81249,28856,76566,55038,103282,3249],"tags":[1,17,268435466,536870937,536871041,536871067,536871213,536871470,536872731,536874007,536874209,536874337,536874539,536874824,536874947,536875056,536875069,536875117,536875258,536875715,536876435,536876990,536877630,536877744,536878326,536880232,1073741827],"developers":[305],"publishers":[305,188],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[25,129,155,301,558,1819,3095,3297,3425,3627,3912,4035,4144,4157,4205,4346,4803,5523,6078,6718,6832,7414,9320],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":851990400000,"platforms":[6,39,13],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1301529600000,"human":"2011-Mar-31","y":2011,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1255996800000,"human":"2009-Oct-20","y":2009,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":851990400000,"human":"1996-Dec-31","y":1996,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bg1vkycltjbzezanmeqs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bg1vkycltjbzezanmeqs","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sjazxizenfa296o9fhxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sjazxizenfa296o9fhxl","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bvhai2m9sdrmcc57k96c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bvhai2m9sdrmcc57k96c","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eovhzz5vcpvqw8jkdxct.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eovhzz5vcpvqw8jkdxct","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ojcnsl4lzlnlchfpqngx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ojcnsl4lzlnlchfpqngx","width":1280,"height":800}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"qdGters14Ps"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/caoxysysyjqvrsfjqszs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"caoxysysyjqvrsfjqszs","width":300,"height":347},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an arcade-style racing game in which players assume the role of a character who must compete in street racing competitions to avoid prison. From a top-down perspective, players use machine guns, rockets, and mines to eliminate other racers. The action is highlighted by realistic gunfire, crashing sounds, and large explosions as opponents' health meters are depleted. As the game progresses, a few still-frame cutscenes depict a recurring character smoking a cigar. The word \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
