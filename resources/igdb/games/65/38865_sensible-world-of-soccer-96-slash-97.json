The games are set to last 3 minutes, but the 20-year career can suck in your entire life for a few months. The graphics are kept very small so the player can orientate themselves on the pitch without need for a radar. The controls are simple, easy to get used to and very effective. In the full career mode you can jump from club-to-club buying any of the game's 29000+ players, as well as play around with team tactics. \n \nAnd you can choose from 1400 teams over the five continents.","collection":4702,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[10121,4643,15851,4642,30830,1993,65118,3641,13257,28403],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536872078,536872637,536875433,536875531,536875562,536875749,536876259,536877432,536878090,536878125],"category":0,"keywords":[26,1166,1725,4521,4619,4650,4837,5347,6520,7178,7213],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":823132800000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":16,"date":823132800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-01","y":1996,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bw55iqjfgsnadtuwgeya.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bw55iqjfgsnadtuwgeya","width":640,"height":830},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sensible_World_of_Soccer#Sensible_World_of_Soccer_%2796\/%2797"}]}
