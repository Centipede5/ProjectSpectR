The game is made in partnership with the Pulitzer Prize winning organization PolitiFact in the hopes of encouraging players to better discern sources of information while gathering beneficial statistics on public misconceptions. By tapping into our competitive nature, we hope to expand political consciousness. \n \nGuesses are anonymously saved online to show how your political awareness compares to other players, and to help identify the stories people get wrong most often. \n \nData on public misconceptions in politics is highly reliant on surveys and our hope is with a large audience of people playing, we can make these statistics more robust and reduce response bias.","popularity":1,"tags":[1073741829],"developers":[15524],"publishers":[15524],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[32,34],"genres":[26],"first_release_date":1514678400000,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":34,"date":1514678400000,"human":"2017","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":39,"date":1514678400000,"human":"2017","y":2017,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/idxwjp15hxyfvejpyark.jpg","cloudinary_id":"idxwjp15hxyfvejpyark","width":180,"height":180},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.cinqmarsmedia.polititruth&hl=en"},{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/polititruth\/id1217091559?mt=8"}]}
