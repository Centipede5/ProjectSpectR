{"id":6165,"name":"Ultima VII: The Black Gate","slug":"ultima-vii-the-black-gate","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/ultima-vii-the-black-gate","created_at":1397862622129,"updated_at":1542342286565,"summary":"It has been two centuries since the Avatar last appeared in our good kingdom. Some have written that at last it is possible to interpret the tales of the Avatar as they should be, with the proper historical perspective. Some argue that as time moves on, the truth of what actually occurred will fade even further away and that we have a responsibility to preserve the legends as we now know them. However, most agree when it comes to a number of basic theories.\n\nWhile there are those who maintain that the stories of the Avatar are only myths, practically all credible scholars say that at least some elements of the Avatar\u2019s tales are historical fact. In reality, one need look no further than the Isle of the Avatar to see very persuasive evidence that the Avatar did indeed exist - at least as a person if not as a spiritual being!\nIt is most likely that there has been more than one Avatar. All of the writings insist that the Avatar who negotiated the peace between Britannia and the gargoyles is the one and same person who first appeared to vanquish the sorcerer Mondain those many years ago. While saying it is most unlikely, historians do not firmly deny the possibility of there having been only on Avatar. After all, our good sovereign monarch, wise Lord British, has himself displayed an amazing longevity!\n\nWhatever interpretation of history proves to be most accurate, it seems undeniable that the Avatar will not return to our fair kingdom. By all indications the age of magic is coming to an end. With the decline on reliability of mages, and with the kingdom turning away from the magical arts, it is doubtful that extreme danger - that which would require an Avatar\u2019s aid to defeat it - will ever return to Britannia. And thankfully so.\n\nUpon us is the age of The Fellowship, in which one does not simply wait in anticipation for a heroic savior when a crisis occurs. In this less spectacular but more practical day, we are left to solve our problems with our own minds and our own will.","collection":498,"rating":81.8839688277927,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":81.8839688277927,"total_rating_count":6,"rating_count":6,"games":[22387,28309,18398,55092,26553,26765,28168,55038,2933,26951],"tags":[17,268435468,268435487,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871470,536871938,536871939,536872120,536872371,536872435,536872898,536872983,536873066,536873364,536875196,536875214,536875265,536875361,536875455,536875531,536875791,536876007,536876326,536876476,536876592,536877150,536878447,536880693,536880854,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[295],"publishers":[295],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[226,227,296,301,558,1026,1027,1208,1459,1523,1986,2071,2154,2452,4284,4302,4353,4449,4543,4619,4879,5095,5414,5564,5680,6238,7535,9781,9942],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":703382400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":703382400000,"human":"1992-Apr-16","y":1992,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ultima 7","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lqh8tjxtxghupncyxazt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lqh8tjxtxghupncyxazt","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pabf80diuvrkmhj9erkn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pabf80diuvrkmhj9erkn","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ymipqlohrdnbjrk0onxu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ymipqlohrdnbjrk0onxu","width":320,"height":200}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ixtv0pix6kle68t7j1mv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ixtv0pix6kle68t7j1mv","width":640,"height":908},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ultima_VII:_The_Black_Gate"}]}
