His eyes were filled with fear and panic, so that nobody could doubt the truth of his words. To survive we left our village and are now travelling towards the coast and its harbours to leave this cursed country.\u201d \n \nBlood Trail is a turn-based exploration RPG about a small band of five medieval refugees who try to reach a harbour, fleeing a deadly plague. It was made for Ludum Dare 43 (Theme: \"Sacrifices must be made\"). \n \nThe game is made of two parts: a map view, where you can command your group across a procedurally generated world with forests, cities and plains and random encounters: while travelling through the lands, you will randomly encounter friendly or evil people, with whom you can communicate or fight. \n \nAt the moment the game is rather a prototype and we appreciate every feedback we can get. The current version should provide a basic game flow and includes some features that were not finished in time for LudumDare.","storyline":"A small group of medieval refugees is trying to reach the nearest harbour, fleeing a deadly plague. On their way there is always a chance of meeting other people who either give them chances for awkward social interactions or fights.","popularity":1,"games":[13196,28794,34155,26940,103054,18623,36553,14394,32195,23345],"tags":[22,268435468,268435472,268435480,536871063,536871489,536871507,536871811,536872054,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[17150],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,577,595,899,1142],"themes":[22],"genres":[12,16,24],"first_release_date":1545436800000,"status":4,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1545436800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Dec-22","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1545436800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Dec-22","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1545436800000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Dec-22","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rvr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rvr","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rvq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rvq","width":1280,"height":800},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rvp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rvp","width":1280,"height":800}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1iay.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1iay","width":600,"height":375},"websites":[{"category":15,"url":"https:\/\/fluffyvoxels.itch.io\/bloodtrail"}]}
