Most of the graphics and sounds have been reworked, the weapons have been made more extreme and some fairly strange things (laser-firing WWII planes and ships that run on ground) have been added. The trademark P-38 has been replaced with a biplane, the Boeing-Stearman Model 75.","collection":874,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6076,6075,17446,10403,22399,6079,6077,39452,79915,52195],"tags":[268435461,536870931,536871078,536871213,536871470,536871851,536873753,536874398,536874745,536875056,536875137,536875406,536875870,536875879,536875934,536876028,536876120,536877744,536877929,536878025,536878192,536880079,536880859],"category":0,"keywords":[19,166,301,558,939,2841,3486,3833,4144,4225,4494,4958,4967,5022,5116,5208,6832,7017,7113,7280,9167,9947],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":583718400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":583718400000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jul-01","y":1988,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/znqqejlgs0kr43mq84kt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"znqqejlgs0kr43mq84kt","width":640,"height":648}}
