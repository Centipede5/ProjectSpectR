{"id":101065,"name":"Iron Danger","slug":"iron-danger","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/iron-danger","created_at":1525909262177,"updated_at":1535194371254,"summary":"\"Iron Danger is a trailblazing tactical action adventure game. It\u2019s set in a world of magic and machinery that draws on the one hand from the Nordic myths that inspired J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s epic fantasy, and from modern steampunk and tech noir influences on the other. In this fresh fantasy world of warrior shamans and machine fumes, you take on the role of Kipuna, a simple village girl, who becomes imbued with a cosmic power that grants dominion over time and death. You must use your wits to control it as you\u2019re drawn into the midst of a war between the city of Kalevala, and the armies of the Northlanders driven by their witch queen Lowhee. Your task is to master the power, in order to use it for mankind\u2019s protection, when your enemies will seek to harness it in the service of total destruction. \n \nOn your quest, you will have to channel the power in the form of ever-mightier magic, and to fight against relentless enemies, outnumbered and overmatched. You will die. Repeatedly. But you cannot let that stop you.\"","storyline":"EPIC SCALE, PERSONAL STAKES \n \n \nIron Danger is a fully story-driven game, in which the action flows from the choices of the heroes and the events that surround them. The fate of an entire world is in your hands, and you will grapple with cosmic magic, terrifying monsters, and colossal war machines to save it. But you\u2019re not a conquering warrior or master of sorcery by birth: you have to grow into your destiny step by step, and you can\u2019t do it alone. Along your journey, you\u2019re joined by companions with their own goals, backgrounds, abilities and personalities. They will guide and protect you, but also bring challenges of their own, and their lives are ultimately also in your hands. Together, you engage in epic struggles and make magical discoveries, but just as important are the relationships you form along the way.","hypes":2,"popularity":7.666666666666667,"games":[26163,36044,47823,80916,81249,22387,25877,102873,104942,25311],"tags":[17,268435468,268435480,268435487,268435488,536871195,536871738,536871865,536874921,536876454,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[15468],"publishers":[15468],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[283,826,953,4009,5542],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,24,31,32],"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":6,"region":8,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wdbvbdoedzj5nvqrniwh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdbvbdoedzj5nvqrniwh","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o0qtilogasc9ckjkin5r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o0qtilogasc9ckjkin5r","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mgbzj8itva1yfvk6pbkr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mgbzj8itva1yfvk6pbkr","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nrwkwriregl4drphmnvc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nrwkwriregl4drphmnvc","width":1918,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zkpb30ldbaa31jkhsr2l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zkpb30ldbaa31jkhsr2l","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"s9pjRMj6VEg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i19w76vupbcr5fmu7npe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i19w76vupbcr5fmu7npe","width":600,"height":800},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/899310\/Iron_Danger"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/irondangerworld"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/irondangerworld"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.irondanger.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"899310"}}
