Players have to answer questions asked by the quiz master (the eponymous Buzz) using the four Buzz! remote controls. \n \nThere are two games available in the single player mode, which are Time Builder, where answering questions will gain time in the final round, and Hotseat, where players must answer as many questions as they can, using the time they accumulated in Round 1. To gain points, players must bank when appropriate. If they get a question wrong, they lose all the points they did not bank","collection":985,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":72.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":72.5,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[25217,11588,19083,19082,28213,18715,37745,12940,51028,7782],"tags":[268435465,268435482,536871684,536873513,536875051,536875632,536876100,536876102,536876763],"category":0,"keywords":[772,2601,4139,4720,5188,5190,5851],"genres":[9,26],"first_release_date":1192752000000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1205193600000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Mar-11","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1192752000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Oct-19","y":2007,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vhclx1xlu4xixbyjh08y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vhclx1xlu4xixbyjh08y","width":800,"height":1146},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
