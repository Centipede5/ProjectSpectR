Super F1 Circus Limited was quickly created to take advantage of this recent development. \n \nWith the exception of the use of actual drivers\/team names, there is no significant difference between this version of the game and the earlier Super F1 Circus. The series would see a proper sequel on the Super Nintendo, with enhanced graphics and additional features, with Super F1 Circus 2 in 1993.","collection":3209,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[58785,40470,80441,73154,72624,71804,69092,68306,67589,66335],"tags":[268435466,536874337,536875069,536875117],"category":0,"keywords":[3425,4157,4205],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":719798400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":719798400000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Oct-23","y":1992,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":722476800000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Nov-23","y":1992,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u0uoqv08us9t2qdspnue.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u0uoqv08us9t2qdspnue","width":398,"height":720}}
