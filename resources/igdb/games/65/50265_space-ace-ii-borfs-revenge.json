You have to avoid traps and enemies by pressing the right key at the right time: cursor keys for movements, Insert key to shoot. You never control Dexter directly, you just choose an appropriate direction. Each of the 27 seconds-long scenes requires one to three keystrokes.

Timing is crucial; you will need to press keys in the exact second. Luckily, you\u2019re allowed to save your progress at four fixed points. \n \nSpace Ace II is ported to the PC from the original arcade Laserdisc version.
