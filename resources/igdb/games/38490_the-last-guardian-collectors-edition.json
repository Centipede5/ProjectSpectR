The game requires the player, controlling the boy, to manipulate Trico like a real animal, such as luring it with food, as to use the creature as a means to climb and reach high platforms or other remote places. This sets the core of the game on puzzle-based action, as in between the various puzzles the player will encounter, enemies will be encountered, potentially impeding progress. It is the player's role to survive in such an occurrence, much like in Ico.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,19289,236,27725,25222,25646,37094,26239,51978,51485],"tags":[268435464,268435465,268435487],"category":0,"genres":[8,9,31],"first_release_date":1483660800000,"platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1483660800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jan-06","y":2017,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vjnq9oybwmk0wcqrnlml.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vjnq9oybwmk0wcqrnlml","width":960,"height":540}}
