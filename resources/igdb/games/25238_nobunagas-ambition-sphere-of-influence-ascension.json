From a top-down perspective, players arrange military units (e.g., infantry, cavalry) and naval fleets around battlefields to expand their territory; zoomed-in views depict small soldiers in combat accompanied by battle cries, sword-clanging sounds, and explosions. Cutscenes include more instances of violence: soldiers shooting rifles at charging enemies; soldiers engaging in hand-to-hand combat; a character dying inside a burning building. One sequence depicts a riverbed stained with blood after an ambush. The word \u201cbastard\u201d appears in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.koeitecmoamerica.com\/ascension\/"}]}
