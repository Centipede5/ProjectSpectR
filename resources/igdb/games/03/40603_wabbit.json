One patch in particular is giving you trouble. It's surrounded by ten holes from which wabbits [sic] dart into your field. Scare off the pesky creatures by throwing wotten eggs at them (they're in \nabundance this year and worth much less than good country carrots). \n \nThe score on the left depicts the number of carrots the wabbits have snatched and deposited in their wabbit holes. The current carrot count increases every time a wabbit gets back into his hole with one of your carrots. Your score increases every time you wallop a wabbit with a wotten egg. It's an egg-citing experience.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,40524,23175,16468,1070,2940,68324,28029,37022],"tags":[1,536875712],"category":0,"keywords":[4800],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":381369600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":381369600000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Feb-01","y":1982,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ulbcvlzzmbmnvv87fjiv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ulbcvlzzmbmnvv87fjiv","width":600,"height":839}}
