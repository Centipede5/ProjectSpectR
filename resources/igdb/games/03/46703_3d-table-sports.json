Choose between Foosball, Slamhockey (air hockey) and Powerhoops (table basketball) for a single game or a best of three, five or seven series. Each game can be played against the CPU or a human opponent via modem\/network play. Up to 16 players can compete in a tournament. \n \n3-D Table Sports is a collection of three classic table games adaptations: \n \nFoosball (Table Soccer) - You spin, pass, block and score with keyboard and mouse controls. The pole you control will be highlighted in red or gold, and in beginner mode pole switching is automatic to the pole that is nearest to the ball. First player to score 10 points wins. \n \nSlamhockey (Air Hockey) - You control the paddle with your mouse, and the first player to score 10 points wins. In battle mode you can cross the halfway line into the adversary side of the table. \n \nPower Hoops - A basketball-inspired table with 35 holes and up to 8 balls. Using the keyboard cursors or your mouse, you select a hole with a ball. You fill a power gauge (displayed under the court) by holding down the space bar or the left mouse button. Releasing them flings the ball towards the hoops. You can play a game of 20, 40, 60 or 80 points.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[22690,15851,36608,34919,55715,14713,80292,78813,78041,78015],"tags":[1,268435470,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[1166],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":797126400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":797126400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Apr-06","y":1995,"m":4}]}
