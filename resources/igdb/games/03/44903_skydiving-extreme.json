As in reality, there is a short period between the time the diver leaves the plane and has to open his chute and the game's challenge comes in aligning the free-falling team members to form impressive formations before the time limit expires. \n \nPlayers can lead their team in competition against a string of computer-controlled international contenders, or go head-to-head against a friend. Each squad can perform over 40 different formations and a practice mode allows the player to perfect his skills without the time limit.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":999993600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":999993600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Sep-09","y":2001,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zytgxew6wjwsrws0wm23.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zytgxew6wjwsrws0wm23","width":1402,"height":1412}}
