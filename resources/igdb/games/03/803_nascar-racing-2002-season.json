This sim provided much more accurate car models and a vastly improved physics engine. The box on the game prominently featured new NASCAR star Kevin Harvick in the Goodwrench #29 car, a driver missing from NASCAR 4 as the game was released very shortly before the death of Dale Earnhardt. Also featured on the cover; Terry Labonte in the Kellogg's #5 car, Dale Jarrett in the UPS #88 car, (in the background) Jeff Burton in the Citgo #99 car, Ward Burton in the Caterpillar Inc. #22 car and Ken Schrader in the M&M's #36 car.","collection":147,"franchise":15,"franchises":[15],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":88,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":88,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[40470,54789,44242,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,5946,55590],"tags":[32,268435466,268435469,268435470,536872060,536875069,536875562,536875955,536876108,536876465,536876786,536876796,536881348,536883035,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[670],"publishers":[24],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1148,4157,4650,5043,5196,5553,5874,5884,10436,12123],"themes":[32],"genres":[10,13,14],"first_release_date":1013644800000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1013644800000,"human":"2002-Feb-14","y":2002,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1013644800000,"human":"2002-Feb-14","y":2002,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"NASCAR Racing 2002","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/almfqicfeg5c2opwjx8w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"almfqicfeg5c2opwjx8w","width":306,"height":400}}
