You have to start at the bottom, initially busting the casual dealers before reaching their suppliers, and ultimately the casino-dwelling honchos. \n \nThis is done through a combination of driving and shooting, through an overhead rendition of Miami. When crooks are stopped they will often provide valuable information, although sometimes they can only be stopped by shooting them.","collection":4868,"franchise":1010,"franchises":[1010],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,28029,10039,76246,19341,36781,68142,27523,28751,36718],"tags":[1,268435461,268435466,536871037,536871937,536872371,536872581,536875291,1073741827],"developers":[12698],"publishers":[1271],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[125,1025,1459,1669,4379],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,10],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/asoboy41n0tdtubqmrar.jpg","cloudinary_id":"asoboy41n0tdtubqmrar","width":800,"height":1267}}
