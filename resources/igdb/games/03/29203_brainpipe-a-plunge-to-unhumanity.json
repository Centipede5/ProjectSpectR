The ultimate objective is to transcend humanity. You do this by navigating the tunnels of your mind, exercising your hand-eye coordination while relishing in the funkadelic sights and sounds of your inner self. Collect the illuminated glyphs while avoiding the nasty obstacles. They may look all nice and shiny, even warm and inviting, but each brush with them brings you one step closer to eternal darkness!\n\t\t\tBRAINPIPE is also an easy game to play, hearkening back to the classic arcade games of yesteryear. A one click interface keeps you focused on the action, instead of searching for the right key to press, and is a perfect complement to the soothing audio and visuals. \n\t\t\tAre you ready for a trip beyond space?\n\t\t\tBeyond time?\n\t\t\tBeyond MIND?\n\t\t\tExperience BRAINPIPE today! \n\t\t\tSingle-player arcade action with a psychedelic twist from the masters of trippy computer gaming, Digital Eel.\n\t\t\tRelive the '60s and '70s without getting hassled by The Man.\n\t\t\tOne click intuitive interface that will have you playing in seconds.\n\t\t\tTen levels of ramping perplexity and oddness.\n\t\t\tEight distracting obstacles to avoid.\n\t\t\tSpinning glyphs to collect, including the awesome UNHUMANITY golden glyph! Transcend your humanity and reveal your true self!\n\t\t\tRelaxing colorful three dimensional visuals race through your mind.\n\t\t\tHypnotic sound and music featuring Eelmix sound management.\n\t\t\tCreepy eyeball buttons.\n\t\t\tPlayable full screen or windowed.\n\t\t\tMouse, joystick, and gamepad support.","rating":80,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[76110,20329,37419,20342,36198,80916,19150,22747,23733,55173],"tags":[1,268435488,536872070,536872407,536875046,536875047,536875347,536875875,536876174,536876290,536876632,536878329],"publishers":[5034],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1158,1495,4134,4135,4435,4963,5262,5378,5720,7417],"themes":[1],"genres":[32],"first_release_date":1246838400000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1246838400000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Jul-06","y":2009,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1246838400000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Jul-06","y":2009,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o2dllhyzefs4l7dg6l5a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o2dllhyzefs4l7dg6l5a","width":1152,"height":864},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mi4offjjbb1cbzw4ehuo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mi4offjjbb1cbzw4ehuo","width":1152,"height":864},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s1eklx1ac3x9607unqgf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s1eklx1ac3x9607unqgf","width":1152,"height":864},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tt0sz7xicsgrqamjotg8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tt0sz7xicsgrqamjotg8","width":1152,"height":864},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fe93c13dktxouiaoqgis.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fe93c13dktxouiaoqgis","width":1152,"height":864}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pnfvz1gkm0thzwcw9avv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pnfvz1gkm0thzwcw9avv","width":1152,"height":864},"external":{"steam":"35800"}}
