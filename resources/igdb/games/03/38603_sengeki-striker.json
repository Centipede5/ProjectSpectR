It is known that destroying enemy ships so that the explosion takes out other enemies, and using the Gambits to destroy targets, are worth points. \n \nSengeki Striker bears some visual resemblance to Shienryu, a previous game by Warashi.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":880934400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":880934400000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Dec-01","y":1997,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zlyjnunsx3kjsvfrt1b3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zlyjnunsx3kjsvfrt1b3","width":850,"height":1200}}
