{"id":24703,"name":"Dungeon of Zaar","slug":"dungeon-of-zaar","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/dungeon-of-zaar","created_at":1475685939396,"updated_at":1532173659114,"summary":"Dungeon of Zaar is a turn-based strategy game taking place in an ancient and magical castle where Explorers fight for treasures! For PC\/MAC\/Linux at launch. \n \nDungeon of Zaar is inspired by classic tactical games such as Final Fantasy Tactics, Advance Wars and by great strategy games such as Warhammer, Pok\u00e9mon and Magic the Gathering. Nevertheless, the game is different from your standard tactical-RPG, we want it to be focused only on strategic decisions and have a huge emphasis on combat. \n \nPlayers will create their own Dungeon Explorer and take part in intense battles in the Dungeon either on single player mode or PvP online or local hot seat mode with their friends around one computer. \n \nExplorers don't come alone into the Dungeon. They are the brains, but not the brawn! They are escorted by a squad of Mercenaries recruited from around the Kingdom to protect them and help them forge onward.","storyline":"On the edge of a magical world, awaits the Dungeon of Zaar, home of the great, eponymous Archmage. Over a century has passed since his last appearance, and now all eyes are on the Dungeon, eager to claim a share of the spoils within. \n \nYou are an Explorer, leading a team of mercenaries (Knights, sorcerers, and monsters of all kinds) to plunder whatever treasures are hidden in the depths of the Dungeon. But beware! You are not the only one who has had the same idea\u2026","popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[20331,14394,26940,23183,14177,27488,40477,28182,27441,7615],"tags":[17,268435471,268435472,268435488,536871170,536871327,536871338,536871422,536872245,536872453,536872460,536872647,536872835,536873092,536873304,536873502,536875952,536876235,1073741827],"developers":[11192],"publishers":[1460,11192],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[258,415,426,510,1333,1541,1548,1735,1923,2180,2392,2590,5040,5323],"themes":[17],"genres":[15,16,32],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"status":4,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,14,3,130],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":130,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":3,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vztuiov7hiyk840rpgpe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vztuiov7hiyk840rpgpe","width":1152,"height":648},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ieg2bahh5gvf0ksqu8i7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ieg2bahh5gvf0ksqu8i7","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/anmabq9h2cruhdu22nvw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"anmabq9h2cruhdu22nvw","width":1152,"height":648},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sjqvfxdjqqon00lylqla.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sjqvfxdjqqon00lylqla","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/thjspctnv8wzjiseylqu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"thjspctnv8wzjiseylqu","width":1152,"height":648}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"HW1nbjSiQh0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xtefy272qwb62qzqosbu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xtefy272qwb62qzqosbu","width":1200,"height":767},"esrb":{"rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/613590"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/dungeonofzaar.com"},{"category":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/dungeonofzaar"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dungeonofzaar\/"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCPycE7-epizFBkNfeEylWcA"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/dungeonofzaar"}],"external":{"steam":"613590"}}
