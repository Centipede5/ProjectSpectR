It is the first video game with a jumping character (predating Donkey Kong by 3 years), which by some definitions could make it the first platform game. The player controls a frog on lily pads and attempts to catch (with the frog's tongue and while jumping) various insects (butterflies and dragonflies) worth different amounts of points in a set amount of time. \n \nFrogs is one of the first arcade games to include a static background as part of the arcade cabinet.[citation needed] The game\u2019s graphics are \"projected\" by laying the monitor flat on its back and reflecting the computer-generated graphics of the frogs and flies toward the player via a mirror at a 45-degree angle. (The game\u2019s graphics were actually generated and shown backward, so the mirror reflection would show letters and numbers properly.)","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,10039,36868,19174,117,1070,51485,26761,26848,37137],"tags":[1,268435464,536871049,536872010,536872961,536874706,536875073,536875394,536875517,536875668,536876318,536876767,536881535],"category":0,"keywords":[137,1098,2049,3794,4161,4482,4605,4756,5406,5855,10623],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":255139200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":255139200000,"region":8,"human":"1978-Feb-01","y":1978,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y9c7ppg8dk55cvtip0jr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y9c7ppg8dk55cvtip0jr","width":850,"height":1102}}
