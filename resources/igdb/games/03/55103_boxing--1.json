The game lasts for two minutes, and the player who can earn the most points in that time wins. You earn one point for a long jab, two points for a close power punch, and if you can manage knockout it's worth one hundred points. Two difficulty levels are included which can be set individually for each player.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[102134,10039,1626,59858,7251,103288,2195,55077,8854,15851],"tags":[1,268435460,268435470,536871544,536871806,536875359,536875360,536876804,536894357,536894358,1073741827],"developers":[66],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[632,894,4447,4448,5892,23445,23446],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,14],"first_release_date":347068800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":347068800000,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"GeSN8DV_ysU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oqtfldgq7idwyzvlef6t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oqtfldgq7idwyzvlef6t","width":600,"height":820},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boxing_(Atari_2600)"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":59,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinemax":2}]}
