Players battle robots, human soldiers, and helicopters in frenetic gun battles. Characters use machine guns, pistols, crossbows, and laser blasters to kill enemies; combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and frequent explosions. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense instances of violence: a character cutting an enemy's eye out, as he screams in pain; a woman shooting a bound man in the head; a man exploding into chunks of flesh. Large amounts of blood-splatter effects and blood pooling occur throughout the game. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.insomniacgames.com\/games\/fuse\/"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
