From a third-person perspective, players explore an urban city and use neon powers (e.g., blasts of energy that mimic missiles, lasers, and explosives) to defeat human enemies. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, slow-motion effects, and small puffs of blood. During the course of the game, players have the ability to attack civilians, though they are not encouraged to do so. The game includes some suggestive material in the dialogue (e.g., \u201cSome women find me irresistible\u2026Sure, if you're paying 'em\u201d; \u201c[I]magine what we'd be like in the sack\u201d; \u201c[Y]ou gonna let this cowboy ride the bull?\u201d). One sequence depicts a character injected with a drug that causes her to hallucinate (e.g., the screen blurs and the sound mutes); a cutscene also depicts characters lying amid syringes as dialogue references drug use (e.g., \u201c[I]f we didn't leave town I was never gonna get clean\u201d; \u201c[H]e even hid my stash...\u201d). The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201cp*ssy,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Infamous_First_Light"}]}
