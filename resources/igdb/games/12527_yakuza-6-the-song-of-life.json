As players explore areas in Tokyo and other cities, they engage in missions that involve fistfights with thugs or rival yakuza members; some fights depict characters using weapons such as pistols, bats, sledgehammers, and pipes. Combat is frenetic, highlighted by screams of pain, gunfire and\/or impact sounds, blood-splatter effects, and slow-motion special moves. Players can perform scripted moves after building up a meter; these actions include breaking necks or limbs and using the environment to cause damage (e.g., slamming heads into a wall, beating an enemy with a nearby bicycle). Cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a gangster shoving a man's face onto hot coals; a character stabbing himself in the belly. The game includes sexual\/suggestive material: a man briefly groping a woman's breasts in a nightclub; online chat rooms in which players' character flirts with webcam girls; characters removing their shirts\/tops while in provocative poses (e.g., \u201cMm, so warm\u2026It feels incredible\u201d; \u201cAh\u2026You're so big\u201d). One area depicts a character dressed in an outfit with a cutout that exposes his buttocks. During the course of the game, Kazuma can order and drink whiskey at a bar; a status icon denotes character's level of intoxication, while his movement becomes harder to control. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yakuza_6"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/yakuza.wikia.com\/wiki\/Yakuza_6"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/yakuza.sega.com\/yakuza6\/"}]}
