Players traverse many different environments using his acrobatic abilities to scale walls and even crawl on the ceilings. Throughout the journey, players combat various enemies as they attempt to cleanse the land of corruption.","storyline":"Prince of Persia takes place in an undefined ancient Persian city-state based heavily around the religion of Zoroastrianism. A thousand years before the events of the game take place, there was a struggle for power between the gods Ahriman and Ormazd. The outcome of the struggle was that Ormazd and his people, the Ahura, managed to imprison Ahriman and his minions, the Corrupted, in a tree. Ormazd then left the world, leaving the Ahura to make sure Ahriman remains secure. They are successful for a thousand years, at which point the Ahura started to believe that Ahriman and Ormazd were myths due to their inactivity, and most departed. Shortly before the events of the game, Ahriman is about to be freed again","collection":187,"franchise":495,"franchises":[495],"rating":79.3178220301498,"popularity":6.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":84.2857142857143,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":81.80176815793206,"total_rating_count":131,"rating_count":122,"games":[24426,56033,20342,55173,80916,19150,20329,35371,37777,47823],"tags":[1,22,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871208,536871945,536872961,536873712,536873787,536875257,536875830,536876545,536876703,536877047,536877275,536878512,536878561,536878600,536881080,536888127,536892701,536892702,1073741826],"developers":[38],"publishers":[104],"game_engines":[7],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":46800},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,1033,2049,2800,2875,4345,4918,5633,5791,6135,6363,7600,7649,7688,10168,17215,21789,21790],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[8,9,31],"dlcs":[23022],"first_release_date":1228176000000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,14,9,12,37,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1334016000000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Apr-10","y":2012,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1326931200000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Jan-19","y":2012,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1346889600000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Sep-06","y":2012,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1326931200000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Jan-19","y":2012,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1339027200000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jun-07","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1228780800000,"human":"2008-Dec-09","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1228176000000,"human":"2008-Dec-02","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1228176000000,"human":"2008-Dec-02","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1237852800000,"human":"2009-Mar-24","y":2009,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Prince of Persia 2008"},{"name":"Prince of Persia Next Gen"},{"name":"Prince of Persia: Heir Apparent"},{"name":"Pop 4","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Prince Of Persia 4"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gqs1lrqlcocbzh3bdv6e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gqs1lrqlcocbzh3bdv6e","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/li16scnweynrmssxjnnl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"li16scnweynrmssxjnnl","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/syseklmuargeyssk92oi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"syseklmuargeyssk92oi","width":1920,"height":1200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tuvybzpkppjd2devfwje.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tuvybzpkppjd2devfwje","width":2560,"height":1600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pdyflydqruboiq4zdfha.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pdyflydqruboiq4zdfha","width":2560,"height":1600}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kxsecluijevs0rrmor1q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kxsecluijevs0rrmor1q","width":750,"height":930},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wozdtblwdanipxv1nmzc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wozdtblwdanipxv1nmzc","width":840,"height":1000},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qq7xddaj34rziahwcpel.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qq7xddaj34rziahwcpel","width":1000,"height":700},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dd2f4koxo0hp5bxhmfdd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dd2f4koxo0hp5bxhmfdd","width":1000,"height":670},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yd4tgo6oo43vynusdxuw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yd4tgo6oo43vynusdxuw","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h2qzgvf0amu6hkaskpnb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h2qzgvf0amu6hkaskpnb","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fu0ojywj1z1q9mvabccn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fu0ojywj1z1q9mvabccn","width":1000,"height":520},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zkcfbhxwmxc5i1xqdhog.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zkcfbhxwmxc5i1xqdhog","width":750,"height":1000}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"DdZT6HIwoU4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1ihc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1ihc","width":264,"height":328},"esrb":{"synopsis":"Prince of Persia is an action adventure game in which players assume the role of the 'Prince' as he navigates through an open-world environment to battle the evil forces of Ahriman, the God of Darkness. Players mostly use swords and magic to battle a series of formerly-human creatures in hand-to-hand combat. Various gauntlet and acrobatic maneuvers can be combined to form strings of different attacks as players get knocked and thrown around \u2013 but never die \u2013 during battle. Story elements are told through cutscenes that contain mild profanity (e.g., 'a*s'), references to alcohol products such as wine, and mildly suggestive dialogue (e.g., 'I'll go first, but, hey, no staring at my a*s. I've felt you looking' and 'Nice carving I prefer a nice nymph or a succubus myself\u2026').","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3},"external":{"steam":"19980"}}
