But once you get past the pretty pictures, you'll find a conventional, simple, sometimes-frustrating experience that feels rushed in spots. It's as if the priority was to gussy up the graphics rather than flesh out the gameplay. Although the graphics really are the best thing about it, a decent story and pretty good combat system make Genji worth playing.","collection":1828,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":55,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":4,"games":[103054,76253,37777,37419,34155,78632,80916,81249,31712,90104],"tags":[1,22,268435481,268435487,536873712,536893535,536893536],"developers":[1214],"publishers":[45],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2800,22623,22624],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[25,31],"first_release_date":1163203200000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1174608000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Mar-23","y":2007,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1163721600000,"region":2,"human":"2006-Nov-17","y":2006,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1163203200000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Nov-11","y":2006,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1174608000000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Mar-23","y":2007,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Genji: Kamui S\u014dran","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kkmxt29kw4nnkfehmuar.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kkmxt29kw4nnkfehmuar","width":480,"height":270}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1h1q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1h1q","width":350,"height":408}}
