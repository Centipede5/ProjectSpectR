The NHL license ensures that real teams and players of the era are included, with a full league and playoff system. Many game options can be toggled - the infamous fighting is option, as are the penalties and offsides. The control system makes it possible to execute one-touch passes, and several special trick moves to quickly advance the ball. As a bonus feature, it included 'Hockey Card' profiles of every player on CD, and interviews with the stars of the game.","collection":200,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[102122,103218,102805,103275,4648,101439,103500,38967,875,824],"tags":[32,268435470,536870956,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[555,692,277],"publishers":[454],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[44],"themes":[32],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":809913600000,"platforms":[29,13,19],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":29,"date":809913600000,"human":"1995-Sep","y":1995,"m":9},{"category":1,"platform":19,"date":809913600000,"human":"1995-Sep","y":1995,"m":9},{"category":1,"platform":13,"date":812505600000,"human":"1995-Oct","y":1995,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mz0fvjrmk2bfbkwkuejo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mz0fvjrmk2bfbkwkuejo","width":256,"height":357},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/NHL_96"}]}
