Instead you steer a cross with your analogue joystick and try to hit the targets flying through the screen. \nWhile in the one player game every miss counts as a point for the computer, in the two player game only hits count as a points for the quickest player.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[101949,101946,101939,101661,101660,101575,101559,101513,101381,101373],"tags":[268435489,1073741825],"developers":[13460],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":252374400000,"platforms":[141],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":141,"date":252374400000,"human":"1977","y":1977,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Zielspiel"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fhtp3cisidvuia31xn2u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhtp3cisidvuia31xn2u","width":600,"height":432}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a8zgce8s4gktubnj8qs9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a8zgce8s4gktubnj8qs9","width":600,"height":432}}
