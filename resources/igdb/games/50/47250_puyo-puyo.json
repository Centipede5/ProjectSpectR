This game is the precursor to an identically-titled arcade release. \n \nPuyo Puyo is the first entry of Compile's Puyo Puyo series. It was released on the MSX and Famicom Disk System on October 25, 1991; the FDS version was published by Tokuma Shoten as part of their \"Famimaga Disk\" line of games. The FDS version would later be released on a Famicom cart in 1993. Puyo Puyo would be succeeded by a much more popular arcade game of the same name. \n \nPuyo Puyo contains three modes: Endless, Mission, and Verses. In Endless Mode, players match Puyo until the top of their well is filled. If the player chooses, either a giant 2x2 green Puyo or Carbucle will periodically help the player clear space on their board. Mission mode gives the player several challenges to complete, such as clearing a set amount of Puyo or clearing all Puyo of a certain color. Verses mode allows players to battle each other.","collection":3350,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9472,26223,27092,28182,24426,8197,7615,26940,29173,55036],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536871208,536873787,536874694,536875181,536875379,536875434,536875472,536875871,536876348,536876930,536877573,536877609,536878299,536879119,536883100],"publishers":[1215],"category":0,"keywords":[296,2875,3782,4269,4467,4522,4560,4959,5436,6018,6661,6697,7387,8207,12188],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":691027200000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":691027200000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Nov-25","y":1991,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Puyo Puyo CD","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Puzlow Kids","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Super Puyo Puyo","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hcyqsonh3nji6qhakey9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hcyqsonh3nji6qhakey9","width":206,"height":301}}
