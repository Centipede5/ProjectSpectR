Festival of Blood is a standalone expansion in the Infamous series based on the Infamous 2 engine and map but does not require a copy of Infamous 2 in order to play.[1] \n \nThe story is set aside from the canon aspect of the Infamous series, being a spoof told by the main protagonist's friend Zeke Dunbar. The game features new characters, powers and comes with a new comic cutscene creation for the main game Infamous 2\u200a'\u200bs user-generated content (UGC), as well as support for the PlayStation Move controller.[2] Unlike previous games, the game does not feature karmic choices on missions due to Cole's vampire state. \n \nInfamous: Festival of Blood \u2013 along with Infamous and Infamous 2 \u2013 was released on August 28, 2012 as part of the Infamous Collection under Sony's new line of PlayStation Collections for the PlayStation 3.[3]","collection":98,"rating":79.93343916348121,"popularity":4.666666666666666,"aggregated_rating":75,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":77.4667195817406,"total_rating_count":27,"rating_count":23,"games":[19561,1941,56033,19249,26658,25076,19565,1905,5503,7331],"tags":[1,19,33,268435461,268435464,268435487,536870926,536871033,536871123,536871937,536871945,536872014,536872032,536872315,536872371,536872449,536872883,536872961,536873299,536873455,536873810,536874452,536875081,536875151,536875157,536875199,536875252,536875265,536875349,536875358,536875401,536875438,536875762,536875830,536875837,536876505,536876511,536876757,536877157,536877299,536877764,536878256,536878267,536878318,536878540,536879070,536879777,536882696,536882697,536892387,536892388,1073741826],"developers":[403],"publishers":[45],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,121,211,1025,1033,1102,1120,1403,1459,1537,1971,2049,2387,2543,2898,3540,4169,4239,4245,4287,4340,4353,4437,4446,4489,4526,4850,4918,4925,5593,5599,5845,6245,6387,6852,7344,7355,7406,7628,8158,8865,11784,11785,21475,21476],"themes":[1,19,33],"genres":[5,8,31],"first_release_date":1319500800000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1319500800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Oct-25","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1319587200000,"human":"2011-Oct-26","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1319587200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Oct-26","y":2011,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nzlqby3ucxbmuf0meqzm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nzlqby3ucxbmuf0meqzm","width":2560,"height":1440},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uhthwquxluovx2vrr3eq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uhthwquxluovx2vrr3eq","width":660,"height":371},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r1ykhxjz0imud3ag3qnx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r1ykhxjz0imud3ag3qnx","width":2560,"height":1440},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tnyttjgand3tylhihqyb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tnyttjgand3tylhihqyb","width":2560,"height":1440},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wfr0embxdejon2hwnkob.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wfr0embxdejon2hwnkob","width":445,"height":264}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r9ikzqjtp7jjvv8yfj6m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r9ikzqjtp7jjvv8yfj6m","width":250,"height":184},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/infamous.wikia.com\/wiki\/InFamous:_Festival_of_Blood"}]}
