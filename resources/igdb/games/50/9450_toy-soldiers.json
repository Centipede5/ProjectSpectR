Players shoot bullets and artillery shells, release mustard gas, fire flamethrowers, and drop bombs on human-toy soldiers trying to enter players' toy box (home base). Players can also use machine guns, howitzers, tanks, and biplanes to assault the enemy's position. The molded plastic toys come apart into gears and springs, flail into the air (i.e., ragdoll physics), or fall over and fade away when defeated; some characters scream loudly when they are scorched by flamethrowers. While the overall context of plastic toy soldiers fighting in diorama boxes lessens the impact of the violence, the game is rated Teen because the depictions of battle are still frenetic and somewhat intense: players frequently hear realistic gunfire, see war through a sniper's periscope, and engage in a series of military strategies and tactics\u2014artillery, barbed wire, chemical warfare, etc. The game also contains depictions of tobacco and multiple references to alcohol: cigarettes are among several \"unlcockable\" items in a display case (e.g., text states, \"Cigarettes are a soldier's most precious commodity\"); rum and beer are occasionally mentioned (e.g., \"Supply Reserve Depot Rum\"; \"Plenty good at finding rum jars\"; and \"Bottles of beer. Good for drinking or using as a visual aid during songs in times of boredom.\").
