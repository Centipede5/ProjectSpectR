{"id":18450,"name":"Jesus Christ RPG","slug":"jesus-christ-rpg","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/jesus-christ-rpg","created_at":1458595973388,"updated_at":1516636313546,"summary":"This game: Jesus Christ RPG deals with the period between the baptism and the transfiguration of Jesus Christ. Like many other Role Playing Games, this one features turn based battles. You also must undertake tasks as Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalane, Simon Peter and Judas Iscariot. Jesus Christ RPG was made using RPG Maker VX ACE and it will run in any computer that can run VX ACE games, like most current versions of Windows.\nNo other biblical game has managed to walk the fine line between being too reverent (but sometimes off putting) and being too zany (thus bearing no connection to the actual gospels). This game walks the line and maintains main events intact while adding its own sense of humor to this story.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[16309,25300,16468,18623,13196,55289,72412,25311,26145,26163],"tags":[22,27,268435468,268435472,268435488,536871938,536872533,536872640,536873184,1073741827],"developers":[9439],"publishers":[9439],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1026,1621,1728,2272],"themes":[22,27],"genres":[12,16,32],"first_release_date":1392076800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1392076800000,"human":"2014-Feb-11","y":2014,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yvggzvo4vjfvioiglccn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yvggzvo4vjfvioiglccn","width":451,"height":338},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w6etjbu6pnbtxhw7vmen.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w6etjbu6pnbtxhw7vmen","width":451,"height":338}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fvrgcbzvxletpmmj7apf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fvrgcbzvxletpmmj7apf","width":460,"height":215},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/wholetonegames.blogspot.lt\/"}]}
