As hero Jack Joyce, you'll fight your way through epic disasters that stutter back and forth in time. But surviving this unstable world--and halting the end of time itself--is only possible by mastering your new time powers. \n \n \nReleased for Xbox One and as a Windows 10 exclusive on April 5th, 2016. Released Steam on September 14th, 2016.","storyline":"\"Time has been broken. A Fracture in time, created by a time travel experiment that has gone wrong, is advancing at an inexorable pace. As a result, time itself is now stuttering to a halt and then restarting, causing the world to turn into a frozen tableau. Most are unaware of the imminent disaster. \n \nJack Joyce is not one of these people: changed by the same experiment, he can see the damage as the Fracture advances; time keeps slipping more and more out of joint and as the world loses synchronization, destruction on a massive scale ensues. Jack is desperately trying to find a way to prevent the Fracture from reaching its conclusion \u2013 that final moment when the last grain of sand in the hourglass tumbles down, and time ends. But his best friend Paul Serene and the ruthless Monarch Solutions have their own plans, and Jack\u2019s efforts don\u2019t line up with them. They are willing to use whatever means necessary to stop him.\"","hypes":34,"rating":74.34038963139321,"popularity":9,"aggregated_rating":76.5217391304348,"aggregated_rating_count":26,"total_rating":75.431064380914,"total_rating_count":108,"rating_count":82,"games":[2114,19441,1941,3042,1121,7333,6801,4786,1009,3247],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487,536870926,536870933,536871082,536871427,536871506,536871738,536871784,536871882,536871889,536871931,536871937,536872205,536872221,536872649,536872695,536872703,536872810,536872883,536873192,536873299,536873338,536874743,536874822,536874906,536875046,536875057,536875081,536875095,536875154,536875228,536875229,536875250,536875256,536875257,536875267,536875269,536875271,536875291,536875330,536875358,536875437,536875453,536875491,536875501,536875508,536875511,536875547,536875572,536875623,536875624,536875635,536875702,536875741,536875743,536875762,536875783,536875792,536875802,536875804,536875819,536875830,536875832,536875886,536875957,536876012,536876108,536876178,536876221,536876227,536876229,536876261,536876262,536876274,536876329,536876353,536876363,536876365,536876404,536876414,536876473,536876530,536876534,536876546,536876576,536876663,536876666,536876735,536876759,536876762,536876821,536877047,536877112,536877150,536877153,536877170,536877180,536877181,536877221,536877238,536877346,536877381,536877390,536877502,536877619,536877656,536877657,536877658,536877659,536877660,536877661,536877662,536877663,536877664,536877665,536877666,536877667,536877668,536877669,536877670,536877671,536877672,536885989,536885990,1073741826],"developers":[305],"publishers":[1010],"game_engines":[35],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":33900,"normally":43200,"completely":48960},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,21,170,515,594,826,872,970,977,1019,1025,1293,1309,1737,1783,1791,1898,1971,2280,2387,2426,3831,3910,3994,4134,4145,4169,4183,4242,4316,4317,4338,4344,4345,4355,4357,4359,4379,4418,4446,4525,4541,4579,4589,4596,4599,4635,4660,4711,4712,4723,4790,4829,4831,4850,4871,4880,4890,4892,4907,4918,4920,4974,5045,5100,5196,5266,5309,5315,5317,5349,5350,5362,5417,5441,5451,5453,5492,5502,5561,5618,5622,5634,5664,5751,5754,5823,5847,5850,5909,6135,6200,6238,6241,6258,6268,6269,6309,6326,6434,6469,6478,6590,6707,6744,6745,6746,6747,6748,6749,6750,6751,6752,6753,6754,6755,6756,6757,6758,6759,6760,15077,15078],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":1459814400000,"pulse_count":43,"platforms":[6,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1459814400000,"region":1,"human":"2016-Apr-05","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1459814400000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Apr-05","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1459814400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-05","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1459814400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-05","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1473811200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Sep-14","y":2016,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wijukqsxcptyrvpyvemf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wijukqsxcptyrvpyvemf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zsuej6n5awd2wmq9zzes.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zsuej6n5awd2wmq9zzes","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uaurykaczco1cpil8ute.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uaurykaczco1cpil8ute","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gkp2ofzniqqasv12s11d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gkp2ofzniqqasv12s11d","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ezkcuvdrtbptkzghiwgy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ezkcuvdrtbptkzghiwgy","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"8_Yo6OhEmjs"},{"name":"Sparkler Trailer","video_id":"InV9dYiquXg"},{"name":"The Game Awards 2015 Trailer","video_id":"_1CJL7c_9nk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lf32zvcmhgaytwrwakrb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lf32zvcmhgaytwrwakrb","width":720,"height":1080},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a third-person shooter in which players assume the role of Jack Joyce, a man trying to save the world by traveling through time. As players progress through the storyline, they use various firearms and Jack's time-manipulating abilities (e.g., Time Stop, Time Shield, Time Rush) to kill enemy troops trying to stop him. Combat is accompanied by realistic gunfire, large explosions, and splatters of blood; close-up slow motion effects are depicted as enemies are killed. Live-action footage depicts blood and intense acts of violence: a man shot in the face; a soldier's throat slit with a knife; a man strangled to death with an electrical wire; a character stabbed in the eye. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d are heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/474960"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.quantumbreak.com\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quantum_Break"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/quantumbreak.wikia.com\/wiki\/Quantum_Break_%28video_game%29"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/QuantumBreak"}],"external":{"steam":"474960"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
