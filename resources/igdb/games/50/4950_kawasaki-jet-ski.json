A variety of courses located throughout the world send gamers speeding along the Thames River, careening down the Canadian Rockies, and veering through the Venetian canals. A stunt mode lets creative players use their Wii Remote to perform numerous airborne tricks, solo gamers can try out Championship Mode and Time Trial, or they can join a friend for multiplayer racing.","collection":5193,"popularity":1,"aggregated_rating":30,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":30,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[28951,67625,6149,22690,43304,58785,40470,26709,14363,28856],"tags":[268435466,268435470,536871552,536872010,536872078,536874337,536875052,536875054,536875069,536875093,536875117,536877830,536883866,1073741826],"developers":[1014],"publishers":[2132],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[640,1098,1166,3425,4140,4142,4157,4181,4205,6918,12954],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":1200960000000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1200960000000,"human":"2008-Jan-22","y":2008,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/alc9zvtqhonjbmkiybmc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"alc9zvtqhonjbmkiybmc","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hf4dshmdc8pthflxet8p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hf4dshmdc8pthflxet8p","width":252,"height":355},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
