Haul cargos to and from the cities of your choosing using your trusty road map. The player also has to watch out for Smokey or he will end up with a nifty speeding ticket. Deliver the cargo safely and it's on to the next job in Truckin'. \n \nThe screen is split in to halves, and a rear-mirror is featured. Players need to avoid incoming trucks and carefully plan the routes, even by consulting a real paper map to find the correct side roads. Some of the scenery included features Texas, Kansas and New York with distinct differences in the environment.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[18623,29173,40470,55590,55689,44242,54789,33603,11419,19290],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435471,536872060,536873364,536875069,536875541,536876419,536877619],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,2452,4157,4629,5507,6707],"genres":[10,13,15],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q547zn4qs1xx8rar2zkt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q547zn4qs1xx8rar2zkt","width":317,"height":430}}
