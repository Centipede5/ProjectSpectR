An unnamed swordsman delves deep into a cursed labyrinth in order to rescue a group of abducted women from their monstrous captors. Throughout the early stages, the player character randomly bumps into other NPCs who dole out advice and tips. Upon successfully clearing each floor, the player is presented with a nude image of the rescued women; this is the extent of the eroge element. \n \nThe game was developed by Games Express, a sobriquet for Hacker International: a company which primarily developed and published unlicensed games for the PCE and Famicom.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[49414,25636,21842,28080,36608,18862,75102,23913,47472,44922],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":708566400000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":708566400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Jun-15","y":1992,"m":6}]}
