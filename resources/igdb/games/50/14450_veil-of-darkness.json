The term \"real time\" means that everything in the game is happening instantaneously with no breaks in game play. Portions of both the 3-D overhead screen and the character screen are displayed at one time. This prevents the need to switch from one screen to another during game play. The full-screen map of the valley is displayed whenever you wish to go from one location in the valley to another. All of the important icons and character information are displayed on the top portion of the character screen. This allows you to have the top of the character screen visible, while your character moves on the 3-D overhead map.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,25646,26914,11296,12579,28289,29525,28148,44076,27266],"tags":[1,19,268435487,536871123,536871938,536871939,536872032],"developers":[15482],"category":0,"keywords":[211,1026,1027,1120],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[31],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"gtdQwOVwbMA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bgdxssfmyratlfu6iz4e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bgdxssfmyratlfu6iz4e","width":800,"height":1028}}
