Two of the games in this collection won first and second place in the 1K competition: Cave 1K won the category, and Splatform came in second place. All three of these games offer addicting gameplay that will keep you coming back for me! SWOOPS! contains a menu that allows you to select which game to play, as well as a \"3-Athlon\" mode that allows you to play all three games in succession.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1083369600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":1083369600000,"region":8,"human":"2004-May-01","y":2004,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hyhwv4bwwtyvgw27srdx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hyhwv4bwwtyvgw27srdx","width":640,"height":420}}
