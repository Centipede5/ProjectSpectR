Surrounded by the unknown and trapped in a series of realms both confusing and dangerous, the youngsters must avoid slipping into the pool between dimensions, embarking on a voyage of discovery and awakening they share with the player, up and down staircases, through light and dark, across the upside-down and the right side-up to their eventual freedom. \n \nSamsara is a beautiful, reflective puzzle game set in a world of echoes where players guide a child safely to the exit by dropping blocks of different shapes and properties into a world of two dimensions split by a pool. Simple mechanics conceal complex interactions involving gravity, balance, redirection and teleportation, with a twist: everything added in the upside down world below reflects in the world above.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"version_parent":76641,"version_title":"Deluxe Edition","games":[10225,28070,27266,107226,96200,236,11367,106992,22917,103303],"tags":[17,268435465,268435488],"developers":[17182],"publishers":[17182],"category":0,"themes":[17],"genres":[9,32],"first_release_date":1547078400000,"platforms":[130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1547078400000,"region":1,"human":"2019-Jan-10","y":2019,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1547078400000,"region":2,"human":"2019-Jan-10","y":2019,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1it3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1it3","width":1000,"height":1000},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/samsaragame"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.samsara-game.com\/"}]}
