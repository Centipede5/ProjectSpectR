It was summarised as \"a true rally simulation. Despite the technical issues, WRC gives good driving sensations and a perfect feeling of the terrain\", and noted that \"It's no Richard Burns Rally and nor does it hold a light to Codemasters' DiRT games, but WRC is a surprisingly enjoyable take on the sport that gets the fundamentals right.\" It got to number 9 in the UK sales charts.[6]","collection":563,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":58.75,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":58.75,"total_rating_count":5,"games":[58785,40470,46834,28856,67625,67685,66002,80441,73154,72624],"tags":[268435466,536870940,536872205,536874337,536875069,536875117,536883529],"developers":[1459],"publishers":[2535],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[28,1293,3425,4157,4205,12617],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1286409600000,"platforms":[6,9,12,37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1417651200000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Dec-04","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1286496000000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Oct-08","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1286496000000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Oct-08","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1286496000000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Oct-08","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1302739200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Apr-14","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1302739200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Apr-14","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1302739200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Apr-14","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1286409600000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1286409600000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1286409600000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Oct-07","y":2010,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"WRC 2010","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jckqzryrya7i9vrlqkkv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jckqzryrya7i9vrlqkkv","width":969,"height":300}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/azg76gsfluvwjeytsw7q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"azg76gsfluvwjeytsw7q","width":256,"height":270},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
