Players battle enemies by placing traps around grid-like battlefields. Enemies lured to traps can be killed by giant swinging axes, walls of spikes, bladed wooden horses, and other sharp instruments that can impale characters. Characters emit large splashes of blood when injured, and blood is occasionally shown pooling under dying characters. Players can knock off enemy armor with an \u201cArmor Break,\u201d reducing them to their underwear in the case of females. One character, nicknamed \u201cthe Masochistic Sorceress,\u201d gets extremely excited at any mention of pain and humiliation (e.g., \"You're ordering me around like a dog...I love it!\" and \"Come on!
