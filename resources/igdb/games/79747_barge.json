You control the more powerful SS Commodore, and must boat through these hazardous waters and rescue as many of these as possible. This involves travelling up a succession of screens, each of which has one person to rescue, while avoiding static rocks and debris. The screen layouts each time are random, so it is not always possible or safe to rescue the boater. You start a screen in the horizontal position you exited the previous one, so a central exit maximises your chances on the next screen. Other boats travel horizontally across the screen - contact with these results in losing a life. A tap of the fire button gives you a quick boost of speed, useful for avoiding hazards.","popularity":1,"games":[100934,87514,101949,11510,91085,90965,99307,87728,90788,110852],"tags":[268435489],"developers":[16866],"publishers":[16865],"category":0,"genres":[33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jkx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jkx","width":336,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jkw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jkw","width":336,"height":240}]}
