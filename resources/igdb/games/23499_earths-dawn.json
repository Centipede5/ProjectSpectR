The E.B.E. moved across the planet like a plague of locusts, consuming anything in their path and wiping out most of humanity. All attempts to fight back were futile, as the E.B.E. appeared to be resilient to every kind of weapon that mankind could offer. \n \nAt the last moment a breakthrough was made: by using weaponry crafted from the E.B.E\u2019s own technology, a weakness was discovered that could be exploited. Bionic implants were quickly developed and implanted into the most superior forces left alive, creating super soldiers capable of taking the fight to the E.B.E. A plan was devised and the objective was clear: retake Earth at all costs and drive the E.B.E. to the edge of extinction as they had once us.\"","rating":90,"popularity":6,"aggregated_rating":65.25,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":77.625,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":0,"games":[25311,80916,90099,36198,25300,22747,55038,76253,36950,105269],"tags":[1,18,268435468,268435481,268435488,536871094,536871422,536871971,536872351,536874745,536875245,536875794,536875954,1073741828],"developers":[10848],"publishers":[832,10848],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[182,510,1059,1439,3833,4333,4882,5042],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[12,25,32],"first_release_date":1442534400000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[34,6,39,48,49,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1478044800000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Nov-02","y":2016,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1516838400000,"region":5,"human":"2018-Jan-25","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1516838400000,"region":5,"human":"2018-Jan-25","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1516838400000,"region":5,"human":"2018-Jan-25","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1477612800000,"region":1,"human":"2016-Oct-28","y":2016,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1477958400000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Nov-01","y":2016,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1442534400000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Sep-18","y":2015,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1442534400000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Sep-18","y":2015,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1481068800000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Dec-07","y":2016,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1478044800000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Nov-02","y":2016,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Earth Wars","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qluop1qgi4t6hxitzvrz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qluop1qgi4t6hxitzvrz","width":880,"height":495},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/muzwsahlkrqcchzgizia.jpg","cloudinary_id":"muzwsahlkrqcchzgizia","width":880,"height":495},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kubx58shivryfpqdmsqq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kubx58shivryfpqdmsqq","width":880,"height":495},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hzhhvazpwp2sqepdliet.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hzhhvazpwp2sqepdliet","width":880,"height":495},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s4nglm8etgnpel5983rl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s4nglm8etgnpel5983rl","width":880,"height":495}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"f_6c4bK3zc8"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"ZKVFavx04Xw"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"GXoqLOS9ioo"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pjf1fey2jmuhmqdajinb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pjf1fey2jmuhmqdajinb","width":770,"height":854},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a side-scrolling action game in which players assume the role of a surgically enhanced soldier attempting to reclaim Earth from aliens.
