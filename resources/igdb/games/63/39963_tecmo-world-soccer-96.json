The game has a total of 32 playable teams, each with its own starting formation as well as ratings in three attributes: speed, power, and press. The teams are divided by groups of four into eight world regions: Europe I-IV, North America, South America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. \n \nOn offense you can perform short or long passes with the A and C buttons, respectively, while the B button performs a scoring kick. While on defense you can manually switch player control with the B button or slide tackle the opposing ball carrier with the A button. Most of the time the game plays like a traditional 2D soccer title, but when the ball carrier and a defending player face off against each other, the game changes into a feinting interface.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":820454400000,"platforms":[79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":820454400000,"region":2,"human":"1996-Jan-01","y":1996,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":820454400000,"region":5,"human":"1996-Jan-01","y":1996,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rm1inrqsovbod9zxtx3o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rm1inrqsovbod9zxtx3o","width":1132,"height":366}}
