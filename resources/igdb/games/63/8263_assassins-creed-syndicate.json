The Industrial Revolution unleashes an incredible age of invention, transforming the lives of millions with technologies once thought impossible. Opportunities created during this period have people rushing to London to engage in this new world, a world no longer controlled by kings, emperors, politicians, or religion, but by a new common denominator: money. \n \nNot everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of this boom, however. Despite fueling the engine of the British Empire, workers\u2019 lives are little more than legalized slavery while the top few percent profit from their labor. Living poor and dying young, the lower class unite in protest as a new kind of family, gangs, who turn to a life in the underworld in their struggle to survive. A struggle, until watchful Assassins come to their side and re-ignite an age-old conflict involving London\u2019s leaders that will echo throughout modern history, from the underground up. \n \nIntroducing Jacob Frye, who with the help of his twin sister Evie, will change the fate of millions in Assassin\u2019s Creed\u00ae Syndicate. Rise to rally and lead the underworld to break the corrupt stranglehold on London in a visceral adventure filled with action, intrigue, and brutal combat.","collection":18,"franchise":571,"franchises":[571],"hypes":20,"rating":76.8330718264538,"popularity":16.66666666666666,"aggregated_rating":72.1578947368421,"aggregated_rating_count":22,"total_rating":74.49548328164795,"total_rating_count":246,"rating_count":224,"games":[1266,128,27316,25300,55038,8187,7570,11156,1936,565],"tags":[1,17,18,22,23,38,268435487,536870934,536871133,536871882,536871945,536872098,536872205,536872315,536872490,536872491,536872550,536872798,536873154,536875046,536875050,536875057,536875067,536875081,536875156,536875157,536875432,536875453,536875590,536875708,536875815,536875819,536876220,536876235,536876255,536876291,536876393,536876406,536876476,536876817,536877125,536877144,536878013,536879063,536879079,536879744,536880100,536881368,536888277,536890082,536890083,536890084,1073741826],"developers":[896],"publishers":[104],"game_engines":[10],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[22,221,970,1033,1186,1293,1403,1578,1579,1638,1886,2242,4134,4138,4145,4155,4169,4244,4245,4520,4541,4678,4796,4903,4907,5308,5323,5343,5379,5481,5494,5564,5905,6213,6232,7101,8151,8167,8832,9188,10456,17365,19170,19171,19172],"themes":[1,17,18,22,23,38],"genres":[31],"dlcs":[109432,18146,109437,15169],"first_release_date":1445558400000,"pulse_count":16,"platforms":[6,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1447891200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Nov-19","y":2015,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1445558400000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-23","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1445558400000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Oct-23","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1447286400000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Nov-12","y":2015,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1447286400000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Nov-12","y":2015,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"ACS","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Assassin's

is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of twin assassins who must infiltrate the criminal underworld of Victorian London.
