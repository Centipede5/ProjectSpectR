Playing as a bomberman, the player can lay bombs to destroy all of the monsters, which will subsequently open the gate. Destroying blocks in the maze may uncover useful items including remote control bombs, accelerators, hearts, and increased firing range. Neo Bomberman includes Bosses that appear after each zone. Each zone is harder than the last, some featuring new traps and level obstacles such as conveyor belts.","collection":549,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76253,91140,103298,36608,34919,103281,103282,1070,37419,78632],"tags":[1,536875262],"publishers":[864],"category":0,"keywords":[4350],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":852076800000,"platforms":[52,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":852076800000,"region":2,"human":"1997-Jan-01","y":1997,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":852076800000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Jan-01","y":1997,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":854755200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Feb-01","y":1997,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cdl1xnkcrfvxv0aouyql.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cdl1xnkcrfvxv0aouyql","width":569,"height":800}}
