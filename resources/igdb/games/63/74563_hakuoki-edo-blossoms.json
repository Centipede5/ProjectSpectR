Players progress through the story, interact with samurai and demon characters, and watch events as they unfold. Some events lead to sequences of violence; these still-frame scenes depict characters slashing each other with swords, and are sometimes accompanied by cries of pain and splashes of blood. Bloodstains are also depicted on characters' bodies and clothing. Violence is sometimes described in the text (e.g., \u201cOkita was struck in his bicep, and blood flowed freely from the wound, spilling onto the ground below.\u201d). The game includes some suggestive material in text (e.g., \u201cHe moved his hands nervously to the top of my blouse, taking his time to undo each of the buttons...\u201d; \u201c[A] figure of propriety and class, was the last person I'd ever expect to force himself onto me\u2026\u201d). The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/733340"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/ideafintl.com\/hakuoki-edo\/"}],"external":{"steam":"733340"}}
