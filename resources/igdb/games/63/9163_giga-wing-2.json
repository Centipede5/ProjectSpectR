The arcade version is notable both for its excessive scores (scores in the quintillions are not unheard of), and for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Treasure Co. Ltd's Radiant Silvergun), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.","collection":1236,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6841,6077,46796,6075,10209,56353,4356,1675,39452,47442],"tags":[268435461,536870990,536871078,536871823,536872225,536873064,536874398,536875258,536875870,536875879,536876120,536876634,536878192,536878566,536879840,536880079],"category":0,"keywords":[78,166,911,1313,2152,3486,4346,4958,4967,5208,5722,7280,7654,8928,9167],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":979776000000,"platforms":[52,23],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":1009756800000,"region":8,"human":"2001","y":2001,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":989971200000,"region":2,"human":"2001-May-16","y":2001,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":979776000000,"region":5,"human":"2001-Jan-18","y":2001,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wpmk3wgknnjngiqsspam.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wpmk3wgknnjngiqsspam","width":500,"height":497},"esrb":{"rating":1}}
