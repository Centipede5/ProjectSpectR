Nowpro) and published by Hudson Soft for the Super Famicom in Japan only. The game uses large sprites for the batters and focuses a little more on realism than many of its more Arcade-ish peers. It includes a Home Run Derby mode, as well as a pennant race and all-star games. \n \nSuper Power League was followed by three Super Famicom sequels, and the Power League series is also present on systems like the PC Engine and PC-FX.","collection":3098,"popularity":1,"games":[80490,80059,74046,72205,64027,64026,59450,58509,49306,47619],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[20,1166],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":744595200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":744595200000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Aug-06","y":1993,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":747273600000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Sep-06","y":1993,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k10qdjwrnvfxigwklhoc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k10qdjwrnvfxigwklhoc","width":225,"height":400}}
