The spies must gather the three segments of a rocket and then dive into a sea where a submarine awaits them. However, only connected segments can be carried at any one time. The second installment also included more complex scenery and continued the dual-screen interface present in the first.[7] The game starts with the two players parachuting onto an island in search of a buried missile. As they search, players are able to build traps to slow their enemy's progress.[7] This game was going to come out on the NES in North America from Kemco but was scrapped because of poor sales of the first game on NES, but in 2009 reproductions of the game in cartridge form were released in both regular and black and white limited edition cartridges.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":475891200000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":475891200000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Jan-30","y":1985,"m":1}]}
