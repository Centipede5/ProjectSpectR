Captures are animated a la Battle Chess, but the battles take place off the board, in futuristic wastelands and similar stages. \n \nThe game offers several difficulties and play styles to choose from, along with time control, ratings on the USCF scale over different time-frames and other niceties. Oddly enough, there's no 2D board.","collection":4129,"popularity":1,"games":[11582,19301,9789,76731,29173,1877,11550,25311,8773,23212],"tags":[18,268435471,536870979,536871015,536871882,536874694,536875054,536875294,536876694],"category":0,"keywords":[67,103,970,3782,4142,4382,5782],"themes":[18],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ssi1kwheqjuwxbhr5xat.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ssi1kwheqjuwxbhr5xat","width":886,"height":1147}}
