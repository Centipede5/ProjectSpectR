The players on both teams are given 20 seconds to choose an action each turn that is then played out in order. \nPrep and Blast actions are shown individually for a better idea of what has happened during their phases. \nDash and Move actions are shown simultaneously during their phases.","storyline":"\u201cTrust in Us,\u201d they say. \n \nIt\u2019s not a bad deal. The Trusts create, maintain, and exploit our glorious post-human era. They control the last Reactor \u2013 resurrection, energy, light \u2013 and the whole world along with it. Work for the Trusts, and live in the last megacity on the planet. Or, become a Freelancer, and live forever. \n \nThe Trusts pay top dollar to\u2026 well, stay on top. Freelancers help them do that. But every Freelancer is free to set their sights a little higher. Take down a Trust. Or create one. Some even try to save the world. \n \nJust try not to die. In this city, life is cheap.
