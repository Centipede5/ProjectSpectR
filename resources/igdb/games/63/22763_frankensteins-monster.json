There you must prevent him from completing his creation. \n \nYour only chance is to gather stones from the dungeon and bring them to the tower where you must build a barricade around the monster before he has accumulated enough energy to come alive. \n \nYou start at the top floor of the castle and must make your way to the dungeon to get a stone to wall in the monster, all the while avoiding ghosts, giant tarantulas, trapdoors, spiders and a pool of acid. Once you have the stone, you must make your way back to the top, again avoiding these obstacles. When you get near the monster, you switch to a new screen where you must make your way past bats to place the stone. You must do this four times and each time gets harder, with more ghosts, more and bigger tarantulas, and a harder to cross acid pool. \n \nYou have three lives and falling into the acid pool will lose you one. You are also timed (see Difficulty settings) and you are trying to get and not lose points","franchise":851,"franchises":[851],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,26914,28154,51485,55752,13189,44177,10039,44076,29525],"tags":[1,19,268435464,268435489,536870928,536872032,536872961,536873327,536875147,536875243,536876263,536877145,1073741828],"developers":[6361],"publishers":[6361],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[16,1120,2049,2415,4235,4331,5351,6233],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[8,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b4aza4hj4vsoprck8upt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b4aza4hj4vsoprck8upt","width":1000,"height":1384}}
