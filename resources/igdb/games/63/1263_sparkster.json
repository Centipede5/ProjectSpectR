{"id":1263,"name":"Sparkster","slug":"sparkster","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/sparkster","created_at":1343251845101,"updated_at":1515695126129,"summary":"The eponymous main character is an opossum knight who fights an army of yellow wolves and robots. He is armed with a sword that can fire energy bolts and a rocket pack that allows him to fly short distances. The gameplay remains mostly the same as in Mega Drive games, with the most notable change being the addition of a short-distance rolling dash. One major difference is that the game's final level depends on a difficulty player selected. On easy, the game culminates with battle against Axel Gear, but on normal, the story continues with Sparkster fighting the leader of the Wolves on the next level. On hard difficulty, the game continues beyond that, with the true final stage.","collection":278,"popularity":2,"games":[2933,24426,19150,56033,9611,22387,23733,20342,55173,26226],"tags":[1,268435464,536871079,536871139,536871208,536871306,536871487,536872961,536874398,536874653,536875074,536875083,536875201,536875308,536875396,536875871,536875941,536875944,536876007,536876020,536876120,536876490,536876755,536877058,536877110,536878192,536878199,536878216,536878439,536880223,536880251,536880737,536882290,536885401,1073741828],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[167,227,296,394,575,2049,3486,3741,4162,4171,4289,4396,4484,4959,5029,5032,5095,5108,5208,5578,5843,6146,6198,7280,7287,7304,7527,9311,9339,9825,11378,14489],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":778723200000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":778723200000,"human":"1994-Sep-05","y":1994,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30b9\u30d1\u30fc\u30af\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"c4aU60ENAlw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k3zpqvomioymcejgedph.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k3zpqvomioymcejgedph","width":640,"height":467}}
