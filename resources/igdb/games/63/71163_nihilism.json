The peculiar, MS-Paint graphics, the surreal humor and a lack of an actual ending make the experience of playing Nihilism quite unusual. \n \nThe game is controlled with a mouse; similarly to Sam & Max Hit The Road, right-clicking changes the cursor action (Walk to, Look at, Interact with, Talk to). Your inventory, as well as the Save\/Load\/Quit buttons, are at the bottom of the screen.","popularity":1,"tags":[1073741828],"developers":[14414],"game_engines":[546],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[203,1027,1416],"themes":[27],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":987552000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":987552000000,"human":"2001-Apr-18","y":2001,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h2s68nggy12hxmpdqwog.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h2s68nggy12hxmpdqwog","width":960,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mqf3rndojpepovmp09hv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mqf3rndojpepovmp09hv","width":960,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s81uwv6khvf7qbnx3jrk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s81uwv6khvf7qbnx3jrk","width":960,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ufgm8jd64qrdlekspojv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ufgm8jd64qrdlekspojv","width":960,"height":600}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ptva3xwzn1f8g47zwidb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ptva3xwzn1f8g47zwidb","width":320,"height":197},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/wikipedia.org\/http:\/\/realityonthenorm.info\/game.php?id=97"}]}
