The Matchbox Emergency Patrol, that's who! Play as a firefighter, police officer, or paramedic in this high-energy challenge based on real-life crises. Whichever hero you choose, you'll receive word of a situation over your radio, hop in your designated vehicle, and navigate your way to the scene of the potential disaster. Of course, there's really no way to know exactly what the scene is going to be when you arrive, so you'd better be on your toes. You might find a robbery in progress, but it might just be two people having an argument, so use your best judgment as to how to handle the situation. Modeled after the Matchbox Emergency Patrol series of die-cast toy vehicles, MATCHBOX EMERGENCY PATROL (the game) is an in-depth adventure revolving around crimes, accidents, and medical emergencies. There are nine different missions for each of the three emergency workers, making it a very diverse game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[58785,40470,28856,67625,80441,73154,72624,71804,69092,68306],"tags":[268435466,536872581,536874337,536875069,536875117,536876066],"category":0,"keywords":[1669,3425,4157,4205,5154],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":993945600000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":993945600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jul-01","y":2001,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tpu0dfs0sypms1pvphrh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tpu0dfs0sypms1pvphrh","width":1392,"height":1392}}
