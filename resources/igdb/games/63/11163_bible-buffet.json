The regular space is the player's own space, red space indicates another spin, a red circle connected to another red circle has the player move one step forward or backward. If the space has a red circle with a question mark in it, the player can take a pop quiz of three trivia questions and then, if succeeded, gets to select either a key, a heart or move ahead one-four spaces, along with the prize of winning a star.
