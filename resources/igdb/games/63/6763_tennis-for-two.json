At BNL\u2019s annual open day in 1958, Higinbotham created what is often credited as the world\u2019s first video game. Hundreds waited in line for a chance to play \u201cTennis for Two,\u201d an interactive game made from an analog computer, two chunky controllers, and an oscilloscope screen just five inches in diameter.\n\nThe visitors, some of the world\u2019s first gamers, saw a two-dimensional, side view of a tennis court on the oscilloscope screen. They served and volleyed using controllers with buttons and rotating dials to control the angle of an invisible tennis racquet\u2019s swing.","rating":85,"popularity":5.666666666666667,"total_rating":85,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":4,"games":[15851,1333,87728,55077,81145,76253,76566,104819,103312,22690],"tags":[1,268435470,268435489,536871223,536875168,536875177,536875666,536876445,536876534,536876718,536877248,536880489,536881123,1073741828],"developers":[2906],"publishers":[2906],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[2,4],"keywords":[311,4256,4265,4754,5533,5622,5806,6336,9577,10211],"themes":[1],"genres":[14,33],"first_release_date":-353635200000,"platforms":[85],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":85,"date":-353635200000,"region":2,"human":"1958-Oct-18","y":1958,"m":10}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"6PG2mdU_i8k"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rcnvpvmtoudlel9nunl1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rcnvpvmtoudlel9nunl1","width":498,"height":384},"websites":[{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Tennis-For-Two-301739412393"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/videogamehistory.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tennis_for_Two"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/wikipedia.org\/http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tennis_for_two"}]}
