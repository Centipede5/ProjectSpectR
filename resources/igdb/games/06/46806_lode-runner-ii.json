This second version contained 30 selected levels from the 150 original levels, in comparison to the first version's 24 levels. Other than the new levels, and some new looks for the enemies (all of whom behave the same) there is no difference in game play. \n \nIrem brought many of their arcade inspired levels to the Famicom Disk System under the names Super Lode Runner and Super Lode Runner II.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":444441600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":444441600000,"region":8,"human":"1984-Feb-01","y":1984,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dvpwxihf27paeuenayvy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvpwxihf27paeuenayvy","width":850,"height":1198}}
