Trials of Obi-Wan includes more than 50 new quests, from rescue missions to the exploration of a crashed Republic cruiser. Many quests also revolve around the return of HK-47 from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, whom players can kill for a quest. \n \nThe expansion also allows players to interact with the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi to help him \"correct an imbalance in the Force\" present on Mustafar. High-level quest rewards include the ability to find a fiery red crystal found only on the volcanic planet that creates a lava-like lightsaber.","collection":56,"franchise":1,"franchises":[1],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"game":145,"games":[25300,22425,26766,25311,19301,19448,26401,11567,2971,36950],"tags":[1,18,268435468,268435469,268435487,536870915,536871148,536871283,536871422,536871882,536871938,536871939,536872060,536872245,536875054,536875262,536875271,536875358,536875464,536875525,536875572,536875735,536875803,536875835,536875836,536875847,536876028,536876232,536876269,536877197,536877220,536877501,536878306,536878322,536879752,536880363,536880376,536880753,536881074,536881122,536883246,536884848,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[243],"publishers":[10],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[3,236,371,510,970,1026,1027,1148,1333,4142,4350,4359,4446,4552,4613,4660,4823,4891,4923,4924,4935,5116,5320,5357,6285,6308,6589,7394,7410,8840,9451,9464,9841,10162,10210,12334,13936],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[12,13,31],"first_release_date":1130803200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1130803200000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Nov-01","y":2005,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/clvtk3eudlzc4xx3ft0u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"clvtk3eudlzc4xx3ft0u","width":1024,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"QW3lxg2mgnI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mjjegv5pqv4xleqbw8xr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mjjegv5pqv4xleqbw8xr","width":700,"height":1000},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence towards non human looking characters","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Wars_Galaxies#Release_and_expansions"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/starwars.wikia.com\/wiki\/Star_Wars_Galaxies:_Trials_of_Obi-Wan"}]}
