It was released in Europe as Smash Tennis by Virgin Interactive. \nThe controls of Smash Tennis work similar to other tennis games and especially Namco's previous tennis game World Court Tennis: the player moves the athlete over the court and presses buttons with the correct timing in order to win the match. This time there is no story mode, but a tournament mode instead. Here the goal is to win the Grand Slam by playing various tournament matches. However. a match only has a single set. There are 20 athletes (both male and female) to choose from which have different advantages and drawbacks.","collection":4601,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[81145,6681,15851,102805,47338,37127,22690,70715,61245,56442],"tags":[268435470,536871223,536872078,536875175,536875176,536875177,536875181,536875919],"developers":[263],"publishers":[10091,263],"category":0,"keywords":[311,1166,4263,4264,4265,4269,5007],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":740966400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":760060800000,"region":1,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":740966400000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Jun-25","y":1993,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Smash Tennis","comment":"European title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ff2pk61ctuntai10qke9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ff2pk61ctuntai10qke9","width":2100,"height":1536}}
