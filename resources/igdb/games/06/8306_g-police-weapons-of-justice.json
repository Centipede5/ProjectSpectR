The various gangs are taking advantage of the G-Police by exploiting their weakened and exhausted task force. With crime back on the rise, the city will have to pull through and pray for a miracle --- fortunately, they're prayers have been answered. \n \nAfter an attempt to silence the terrorist organizations, your squad receives word of Marines being sent in to help with the current situation. Unfortunately, they're a few days away from the city and the G-Police can't keep things under control; the rivalry between good and evil heats up before their arrival. \n \nWhen the Marines and their heavy firepower enter the city -- things are already too late. Those small gangs have turned into full-blown crime syndicates making the force of good's job much harder. Fortunately, your squad of officers has the upper hand -- the G-Police uses a variety of five attack choppers including the Venom and Havoc. Additionally, the Marines have supplied their Corsair cruise ship, Raptor, and Rhino --- a giant mechanized robot used for mass destruction and a heavily armed patrol vehicle, respectively.","collection":1116,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,28029,25311,27314,11253,64204,25300,19341,71455],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435469,536870933,536870937,536871079,536871882,536872651,536874539,536875358,536876415,536877501,1073741826],"developers":[764],"publishers":[764],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[21,25,167,970,1739,3627,4446,5503,6589],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,13],"first_release_date":936057600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":936057600000,"human":"1999-Aug-31","y":1999,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"G-Police 2","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xamsngbmoywmz21hy6ru.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xamsngbmoywmz21hy6ru","width":650,"height":460},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ukxs2qfx7fek1lcrjdbe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ukxs2qfx7fek1lcrjdbe","width":650,"height":460},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rqrmw3jziq1oeylti0ak.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rqrmw3jziq1oeylti0ak","width":650,"height":460}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/merqa6mav4x5gchceg1v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"merqa6mav4x5gchceg1v","width":256,"height":256},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
