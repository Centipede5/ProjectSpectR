{"id":49306,"name":"Crushed Baseball","slug":"crushed-baseball","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/crushed-baseball","created_at":1500020048082,"updated_at":1516159288802,"summary":"With its unique comic-book inspired art style, Crushed Baseball 2004 will offer fast-paced arcade gameplay that will appeal to both sports and non-sports gaming fans. With its over-the-top style, players will be able to power-up characters and give them superhuman abilities and special powers called \"Mojo\" abilities. For example, a pitcher might throw a pitch that acts as a buzz-saw and slices through the hitter's bat; a batter may hit a ground ball that lodges itself in the field so it can't be picked up, and a fielder might use their suction glove ability to suction the ball into their glove to record an out.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[80490,80059,74046,72205,64027,64026,59450,58509,47619,46549],"tags":[268435470,536870932,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[20,1166],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1111449600000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1111449600000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Mar-22","y":2005,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/guphxfvzqwpy7jj3qdxt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"guphxfvzqwpy7jj3qdxt","width":640,"height":669},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
