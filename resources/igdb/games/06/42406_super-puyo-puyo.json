The Puyos are little creatures with eyes who, in most variations of the game, fall from the top of the screen in a pair. The pair can be moved left and right and rotated. The pair falls until it reaches another puyo or the bottom of the screen.","popularity":2,"games":[95776,80174,19222,113471,101563,87507,90766,107249,10225,88511],"tags":[268435465],"publishers":[1215],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":758160000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":758160000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Jan-10","y":1994,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xsi2mqnwsxgcmltpe8ss.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xsi2mqnwsxgcmltpe8ss","width":640,"height":1183}}
