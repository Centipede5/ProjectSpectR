With the return of mankind's ancient foe and the kingdom engulfed in civil war, you have been chosen by fate to unite the shattered lands and slay the archdemon once and for all.","storyline":"In every origin story, the player is introduced to Duncan, a Grey Warden who is trying to find recruits to join the order. By the end of their origin story, the player's character is selected as a potential Grey Warden, and leaves with Duncan.  \n  \nThe player and Duncan journey to a fortress called Ostagar in southern Ferelden, to join Cailan, the King of Ferelden, and Loghain, a legendary general and Cailan's father-in-law. The three leaders plan to make a stand against the encroaching Darkspawn before the Blight can overwhelm Ferelden. Duncan can sense the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like being hosted in the body of a powerful Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which means that this would be the first true Blight in over 400 years. It is of utmost importance that this Blight is ended before it can gain momentum, as previous Blights have left Thedas all but in ruins.","collection":10,"rating":87.2454335305136,"popularity":19,"aggregated_rating":90.2,"aggregated_rating_count":14,"total_rating":88.72271676525679,"total_rating_count":553,"rating_count":539,"games":[78,1887,478,1593,73,2933,75,80,22387,498],"tags":[1,17,268435468,536871059,536871139,536871208,536871244,536871390,536871504,536871758,536871938,536872225,536872371,536872435,536872626,536872798,536872799,536872978,536873066,536873718,536873949,536874136,536874552,536875050,536875281,536875372,536875398,536875432,536875531,536875638,536875735,536875764,536875774,536875779,536875791,536875830,536875889,536875935,536875937,536876007,536876235,536876286,536876392,536876476,536876545,536876585,536876969,536877032,536877209,536877383,536877965,536878072,536878267,536878382,536878423,536878512,536878610,536879062,536879106,536880547,536882924,536883649,536883846,536885222,536888127,536888363,536893175,536893176,1073741826,1073741827],"developers":[2],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[75],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":227557,"completely":279000},"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[147,227,296,332,478,592,846,1026,1313,1459,1523,1714,1886,1887,2066,2154,2806,3037,3224,3640,4138,4369,4460,4486,4520,4619,4726,4823,4852,4862,4867,4879,4918,4977,5023,5025,5095,5323,5374,5480,5564,5633,5673,6057,6120,6297,6471,7053,7160,7355,7470,7511,7600,7698,8150,8194,9635,12012,12737,12934,14310,17215,17451,22263,22264],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"expansions":[77],"dlcs":[17465,17466,17464,17462,22963,22975],"first_release_date":1257206400000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[6,14,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1296086400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Jan-27","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1258675200000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-20","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1257206400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-03","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1257206400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-03","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1261353600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-21","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1257206400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-03","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1257379200000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Nov-05","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1257379200000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Nov-05","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1257465600000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-06","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1257465600000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-06","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1296086400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Jan-27","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1296086400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Jan-27","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1416355200000,"region":3,"human":"2014-Nov-19","y":2014,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"DAO"},{"name":"Dragon

is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of mythical warriors through missions and battles in the ravaged lands of Ferelden. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person role-playing games where the user does not usually have direct control over combat moves. Instead, players select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, dragon, bear, etc.) and an action (e.g., \"attack,\"\"kill,\" and magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage by emitting splashes of red blood; pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. The most intense instances of violence occur when players have the option to kill non-combatant civilians: A prisoner can be stabbed to death in order to steal a key; a merchant who overcharges refugees can be slashed in the throat; and a boy possessed by an evil demon can be killed off-screen. During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select \"Surprise me,\" they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features  human  nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts. Some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"a*s\") can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Sexual violence.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/dragonage.bioware.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/17450"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/dragonageofficial"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/dragonagegame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/dragonage"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dragon_Age:_Origins"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/dragonage.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dragon_Age:_Origins"}],"external":{"steam":"17450"}}
