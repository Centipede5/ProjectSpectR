Players use machine guns, sniper canons, and grenade launchers to kill waves of enemy creatures and larger bosses. The combat can be frenetic at times, and is accompanied by realistic gunfire and explosions; enemies fall to pieces and disappear when defeated. A handful of still-frame cutscenes include magazine covers or character descriptions that reference suggestive material (e.g., '[This pilot] loves to sleep with his wife,' 'The Sex-Beast of Route 66,' and 'Saucy Succubi of Transylvania'). Several scenes depict characters smoking cigars or cigarettes. The words 'sh*t,' 'b*tch,' and 'a*s' can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.ironbrigadegame.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/115120"}],"external":{"steam":"115120"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
