Centuries have passed since the world succumbed to an unforeseen shadow of evil, and a hero was made an immortal by demons. These demons have risen once again in the present day causing unrelenting mayhem reinforced by destructible environments within the game. Now using his immortalic regenerative powers re-assembling his own body to evade death, the hero carries out the only salvation the world will know, for he is Never Dead.","rating":80,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":48.125,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":64.0625,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":0,"games":[1006,547,28204,528,475,1913,514,7351,7020,977],"tags":[1,18,19,27,268435461,536871010,536871117,536871139,536871208,536871262,536871882,536871937,536871945,536872032,536872205,536872221,536872245,536872883,536873065,536873352,536873973,536874398,536874745,536875046,536875073,536875098,536875199,536875257,536875271,536875281,536875301,536875314,536875330,536875340,536875396,536875437,536875455,536875488,536875493,536875523,536875526,536875527,536875532,536875537,536875538,536875572,536875610,536875695,536875745,536875750,536875781,536875804,536875808,536875822,536875895,536875941,536876109,536876261,536876365,536876435,536876471,536876521,536876603,536876652,536876695,536876762,536876821,536876934,536876948,536877175,536877264,536877283,536877287,536877628,536877653,536877974,536878032,536878075,536878213,536878281,536878317,536878566,536880578,536880863,536880925,536881594,536882447,536882664,536882680,536882859,536883374,1073741826],"developers":[318],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[98,205,227,296,350,970,1025,1033,1120,1293,1309,1333,1971,2153,2440,3061,3486,3833,4134,4161,4186,4287,4345,4359,4369,4389,4402,4418,4428,4484,4525,4543,4576,4581,4611,4614,4615,4620,4625,4626,4660,4698,4783,4833,4838,4869,4892,4896,4910,4983,5029,5197,5349,5453,5523,5559,5609,5691,5740,5783,5850,5909,6022,6036,6263,6352,6371,6375,6716,6741,7062,7120,7163,7301,7369,7405,7654,9666,9951,10013,10682,11535,11752,11768,11947,12462],"themes":[1,18,19,27],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1327968000000,"platforms":[9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1327968000000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jan-31","y":2012,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1328227200000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Feb-03","y":2012,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1327968000000,"human":"2012-Jan-31","y":2012,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1327968000000,"human":"2012-Jan-31","y":2012,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Never Dead","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30cd\u30d0\u30fc\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bc664ilwilrlkukvq86g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bc664ilwilrlkukvq86g","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v6kidylambkrzyhdimut.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v6kidylambkrzyhdimut","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fsekndn3kqzidtvsskai.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fsekndn3kqzidtvsskai","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c7cedc1egl2gbthqfqib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c7cedc1egl2gbthqfqib","width":1528,"height":1602},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action game in which players assume the role of Bryce Boltzman, an immortal demon hunter on a quest to save the world from a demonic invasion. From a third-person perspective, players use swords, pistols, and machine guns to kill demons and enemy creatures in both ranged and melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire, explosions, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood; enemies are sometimes hacked into pieces. One gameplay mechanic involves the frequent dismemberment of Bryce (e.g., getting hit by a car or helicopter blade and reduced to scattered body parts); players can manipulate, regenerate, and reassemble dismembered limbs to solve environmental puzzles and complete battle sequences. Some cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a rival getting beheaded with a sword; a companion getting impaled in slow motion. The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201ca*s,\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/neverdead.wikia.com\/wiki\/NeverDead_Wiki"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
