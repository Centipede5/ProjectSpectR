The game was first released in Japan for the Super Famicom on November 25, 1994, and has since been ported to PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, PC, and mobile phones. An English localized version (including changes to the setting and character names) of the game was released by Aksys Games on January 24, 2014 for iOS, with a release on Android devices to follow.[1][2] The story-line was written by Takemaru Abiko and production was directed by Kazuya Asano and K\u014dichi Nakamura. \n \nBanshee's Last Cry was the second sound novel developed by Chunsoft, and its popularity brought a myriad of other companies to develop similar games. The term \"sound novel\" was originally a registered trademark of Chunsoft, but is now regarded as a whole genre of its own. The game sold close to a million copies (including remakes and ports), making it a financial success as well.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"developers":[1217,5172,1093],"publishers":[1217,5172,1093],"category":0,"keywords":[94],"first_release_date":785721600000,"platforms":[39,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1390521600000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jan-24","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":785721600000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Nov-25","y":1994,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u304b\u307e\u3044\u305f\u3061\u306e\u591c","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Kamaitachi no Yoru","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xzqogcwiezzrhdf8pjlo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xzqogcwiezzrhdf8pjlo","width":643,"height":857},"websites":[{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/banshees-last-cry\/id740139977?mt=8"}]}
