{"id":10644,"name":"Order of War","slug":"order-of-war","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/order-of-war","created_at":1432627194748,"updated_at":1545293592874,"summary":"In the summer of 1944, the Second World War entered its end-game when the Allies launched two major operations that would drive back German forces on both the Western and Eastern Fronts at once. \n \nTheir names were Overlord and Bagration. Overlord famously commenced with the D-Day landings in Normandy and ended in the Liberation of Paris, while Bagration - a far less well-known but far larger Russian operation - crushed the invading German forces in the east, leading to their complete withdrawal from Soviet territory. Had either operation been unsuccessful, history could have been very different. \n \nIn the ultimate test of military strategy, Order of War will challenge you not only to lead America's finest to victory in the west, but also place you in command of the German forces charged with repelling the Red Army's seemingly unstoppable offensive in the east. Even the keenest military minds will find that it's one thing to make history, but quite another to change it.","rating":44.5195958901534,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":62,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":53.2597979450767,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":4,"games":[55029,30229,31480,78550,8773,22399,9856,27091,10243,6985],"tags":[39,268435467,268435471,536870931,536872019,536872070,536872383,536872733,536875137,536875593,536875624,536876407,536878117,536883865,536883994,1073741826],"developers":[790],"publishers":[26],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[19,1107,1158,1471,1821,4225,4681,4712,5495,7205,12953,13082],"themes":[39],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":1253577600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1253577600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Sep-22","y":2009,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bc7rvjcjhnndsphytges.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bc7rvjcjhnndsphytges","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ertevvho4pxqhkqjpf4a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ertevvho4pxqhkqjpf4a","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zddn93fe1nretxfoiise.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zddn93fe1nretxfoiise","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/phljb1vc9mvhojg6qer7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"phljb1vc9mvhojg6qer7","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l94etd32svn50uxaagmb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l94etd32svn50uxaagmb","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/agpgfvm5uc3a2e53d6ms.jpg","cloudinary_id":"agpgfvm5uc3a2e53d6ms","width":1000,"height":1420},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a real-time strategy game (RTS) set in World War II Europe during 1944. Players command either American or German infantry units and tank battalions through story campaigns. Presented from a top-down perspective, the game allows players to deploy their units on a battlefield and attack specific targets or soldiers. Artillery and air strikes can also be called against enemy forces. There are several sound effects associated with the combat, including building destruction, realistic explosions and gunfire, and cries of pain. Cutscenes and historical footage sometimes depict combat from a closer perspective (i.e., zoomed-in). The dialogue contains the expletives 'hell' and 'damn' as well as derogatory remarks against German troops (e.g., 'Jerries').","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.orderofwar.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/34600"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Order_of_War"}],"external":{"steam":"34600"}}
