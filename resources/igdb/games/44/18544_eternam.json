A CD-ROM version with full speech was published in 1993. The game was developed by Hubert Chardot, who is better remembered from his Lovecraft-themed games Shadow of the Comet and Prisoner of Ice. While the game is mainly a two-dimensional adventure game, it contains a three-dimensional subgame, which pays homage to Drakkhen, a roleplaying game from Infogrames.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[13189,27314,25222,19448,26766,29004,25300,236,36950,19289],"tags":[17,18,27,268435458,268435487,536871325,536871859,536871882,536871939,536871991,536872423,536872435,536873016,536875058,536876322,536881650,1073741828],"developers":[720],"publishers":[720],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[413,947,970,1027,1079,1511,1523,2104,4146,5410,10738],"themes":[17,18,27],"genres":[2,31],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[13,118],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":118,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/df95eritvh66awx7flyb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"df95eritvh66awx7flyb","width":640,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r0mho4c4txt1kc7vnwl6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r0mho4c4txt1kc7vnwl6","width":300,"height":386}}
