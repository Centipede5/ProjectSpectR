Remix is a portable version of Midnight Club: Los Angeles. \n \nThe game features only a portion of Los Angeles, using a slightly-modified version of the L.A. map from Midnight Club II. Making up for this, the game features another playable city, Tokyo, which uses the same map from Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix. \n \nUnlike the console version, the police do not chase the player in \"Cruise\" mode. However, the player can get caught after running from the police for a long period of time, and eventually getting boxed in, and getting no fine. Also unlike the console version, Midnight Club: L.A. Remix does not feature cutscenes. Also, the cars in the game have been split up meaning that one half of the cars can be used in Los Angeles while the other half can be used in Tokyo, the bikes aren't split as all three can be used in Los Angeles and Tokyo.","popularity":1,"version_parent":7071,"version_title":"PSP version","category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tqn4egnornfix8paf018.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tqn4egnornfix8paf018","width":697,"height":1200}}
