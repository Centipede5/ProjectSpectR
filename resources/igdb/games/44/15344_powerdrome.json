Why race on flat 2D circuits when you can charge through a multi-textured half-pipe in small aircraft? Typhoon Racing have taken up the challenge, and entered you in their machine. \n \nThere are 6 different circuits, with hazards including chicanes, tunnels and crusher gates. Shading to the sections marks out whether a corner or dive is coming up. There are 5 computer opponents to race against in one player mode, while a data link cable allows 2-player games. \n \nEach planet has its own atmosphere, and your machine's filters will need to be set to take account of this. Rain on some circuits necessitates a pitstop for a changeover. You are armed with afterburners, which can provide a speed use in open air but should not be overused. The Amiga version allows you to adjust the sensitivity of the controls - either way, joystick is easier to use but mouse is seen as ultimately being faster.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":72,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":72,"total_rating_count":2,"tags":[1073741825],"publishers":[1],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[63,13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jtoq8w5fuijodxxfsnrt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jtoq8w5fuijodxxfsnrt","width":1000,"height":1301}}
