The levels consist of a collection of cogs, which can be rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise to achieve this goal. There are lots of special blocks to help out, including bombs, diamond-producers and anti-gravity blocks. Each level has its own time limit, ranging from seconds to minutes - this doesn't start until you make your first move, and you can look around the level at your leisure before making a stab at it. Each level has its own password, which makes progression a little easier.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[114,13,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wgdwiqes3c5mhhndlra7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wgdwiqes3c5mhhndlra7","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d9xa69iygplzudcauum4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d9xa69iygplzudcauum4","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gmal2fdtcccfy9gmgokn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gmal2fdtcccfy9gmgokn","width":640,"height":805}}
