{"id":7744,"name":"Godzilla","slug":"godzilla","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/godzilla","created_at":1411461847669,"updated_at":1510763148924,"summary":"Godzilla is a strategy game in which you must command the military in an attempt to kill Godzilla before he destroys Tokyo. If Godzilla reaches Tokyo, the game is over. The game is a large grid on the map of Japan and nearby waters. There are 25 grids (7 of which contain Japan and one containing Tokyo.) Godzilla is randomly set in any of the 25 grids except the grid with Tokyo. The player has a choice of attacking Godzilla or moving troops. You are given a choice of attacking with a land attack, sea attack, air attack, a missile or an atom bomb. When choosing an air, land or sea attack you must choose how many troops, boats or jets you want to send out (you can only send out how many of the given attackers are in the grid that Godzilla is.) You can also move troops and boats to different grids as opposed to attacks. After an attack it will show the amount of attackers killed and how effective the attack was. (e.g. If you send out a sea attack it will tell how many boats were sunk.) After this Godzilla will move to another grid. If Godzilla is on land he will go on a rampage and it will show how many civilians were killed. The atom bomb is the most powerful weapon in the game. Whenever it is used it will destroy all life and weapons around the surrounding 8 squares. If the bomb goes off near Tokyo, the game is over.","franchise":205,"franchises":[205],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,107226,32510,25646,23183,902,106859,107614,18011,28182],"tags":[19,268435465,268435471,268435472,536871327,1073741827],"developers":[3664],"publishers":[3664],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[415],"themes":[19],"genres":[9,15,16],"first_release_date":441676800000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gwl2ezfakvoaz8irmp19.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gwl2ezfakvoaz8irmp19","width":370,"height":245}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"wpsab4jG2Mc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sfh8mlrgoresc86riub0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sfh8mlrgoresc86riub0","width":600,"height":835},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/godzilla.wikia.com\/wiki\/Godzilla_(Commodore_64)"}]}
