The object of the game is to get a higher count of cards than the dealer, up to but not over 21. If a player draws cards with a point value over 21, the hand is a BUST, and he loses his bet to the dealer. If the dealer's goes BUST, he pays off each of the remaining players. A player may \"draw\" any number of cards until he reaches or exceeds a total of 21. The dealer must \"draw\" a card on 16 or less and \"stick\" with his hand on 17 or more. An ace counts as either 1 or 11 at the player's discretion. Kings, queens and jacks count as 10 each. All other cards count as their face value.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,19934,55590,18623,25311,76731,9199,23345,19376,55689],"tags":[1,268435469,268435471,268435472,536871641,536872060,536874083,536874694],"category":0,"keywords":[729,1148,3171,3782],"themes":[1],"genres":[13,15,16],"first_release_date":255139200000,"platforms":[88],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":88,"date":255139200000,"region":8,"human":"1978-Feb-01","y":1978,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dvk9pngxf0zrxcwhu3wz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvk9pngxf0zrxcwhu3wz","width":679,"height":900}}
