A head-up display is superimposed on the main screen; this shows engine thrust, the ATF's speed, ground height and altitude, along with the missile system available, direction of flight and a target's range and bearing. \n \nThe right-hand side is devoted to the \"on-board flight computer\" which shows enemy positions on a world map, the status of weapon systems and the ATF itself. Above the flight computer display is a panel which shows the score and number of lives left.","collection":1800,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":77,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":77,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[68287,28751,36950,28029,64204,27314,76229,71455,25300,18088],"tags":[1,18,39,268435461,268435489,536870913,536871882,536875171,536881342,1073741826],"publishers":[467],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,970,4259,10430],"themes":[1,18,39],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gezoj1alw3ydcxafxatr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gezoj1alw3ydcxafxatr","width":1024,"height":1366}}
