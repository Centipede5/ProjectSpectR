{"id":47144,"name":"Red Scorpion","slug":"red-scorpion","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/red-scorpion","created_at":1499742574223,"updated_at":1509722615697,"storyline":"RED SCORPION \n \n \nMERCENARY FOR POWER AGENCY LTD \n \nTOP SECRET \n \nDear Volunteer \nI am pleased to inform you of \nyour selection for service in the \nTerran Confederation Star \nCommandos. \n\tThe Confederation Star \nCommandos are a proud and \nelite corps with exacting \nrequirements and superior \ncombat skills. You must \nunderstand that failure of a \nmission will not be tolerated - \nand this fact cannot be \nemphasized enough. \n\tI must say I am impressed with \nyour track record. The \nCommanding Officer of Tutmos \nIII had a lot of praise for your \ndedication and stamina while \nposted as an instructor at the \nMobile Organic Sanitation Unit. \n\tYour first combat tour of duty is \nthe Bombyx Moons. These are a \nlarge number of small planetoids \nin the 97th Quadrant. They lie \nexactly between the Terran \nConfederation and our galactic \nsuperpower rival, The Necron Empire. \n\tThe Bombyx are rather a \nprimitive people -they program \ntheir computers!!! In fact no-one \nwould even give them a second \nglance but for the fact that the \nmoons are virtually pure Talanite. \n\tThe evil Necrons are intent on \ndominating the Bombyx. They \nare literally \"stealing\" the \nBombyx's Talanite in exchange \nfor worthless trash. I personally \nwould describe it as an inter- \nplanetary rip-off!!! We, on the \nother hand, are going to bring \nthe Bombyx all the benefits of \nTerran Civilisation - pulpburgers, \nsynthocola -you know, that sort \nof thing - in exchange for a few \nTalanite crystals (40 Gigatonnes \nper oscillation). \n\tI have enclosed copies of full \ndetails of the mission and a \ndescription of the equipment \n---------------------------- \nwhich will be issued to you. This \nequipment (The Multi-Role \nInfantry Combat Capsule) has \nonly just been released by the \n\"boffins\". It is, therefore, \nimperative that you read and \ninwardly digest the information \nconcerning its operation. \n \nMission Details: \nThe Assault Carrier \"Coral Sea\" \nand the Battle Cruiser \"Zhukov\" \nare to proceed to the Bombyx \nMoons. Star Commandos will be \ndropped onto the surface of the \nMoons. Their mission is to \neliminate Necrons and all \nBombyx military and \ncommunication installations \nand personnel. In addition, all \nstructures connected with the \nmining or utilisation of Talanite \nare to be destroyed. Bombyx \ncivilians and their homes are to \nbe unharmed. Any commando \ndisobeying the rules of \nengagement will be punished. \n(It must be remembered we are \nhere to liberate these people.) \n \nEquipment Details: \n \nMURICC: \nThe Multi-Role Infantry Combat \nCapsule or Death Scorpion MkIV \nis the most powerful infantry \nweapon developed so far. \n\tThe commando has a CAV \n(Combat Action Visor) through \nwhich he views the combat \narea. Information is flashed up \naround the visor through the \nHUDWAS (Head Up Display \nWeapon Aiming System). This \nmeans the commando never \nhas to look down at the vehicle's \ncontrols. Vision through the CAV \nis aided by AVS (Augmented \nVision System). \n \nAVS: \nThe commando can select from \n4 modes of the electromagnetic \nspectrum. Natural light is \nbasically equivalent to human \nvision. Microwave can be used to \nsee through camouflage or \n------------------------- \ndetect underground \ninstallations. Infra Red detects \nfast moving objects and Talanite \nis sensitive to Ultra Violet. \n \nWeapons: \nThe Death Scorpion is equipped \nwith a Tomatak particle cannon \ncapable of destroying most \nmobile or small soft targets. \nPlease note after repeated fire \nthe cannon gets hot and its \neffect weakens. It will be \nnecessary to close the target or \nallow the cannon barrels to cool. \nArmour Piercing (AP) missiles are \navailable for hard or buried \ntargets. Cluster Bomb (CB) \nmissiles take out large soft \ntargets. All weapons range to \nthe horizon. \n \nDefence: \nThe cannon can be used in \ndefence - particularly in Sight \nMode. There are Sonic Stunners \nwhich will temporarily paralyse \naliens. But beware! They will also \ndamage the Death Scorpion's \nshields. An Electronic Warfare \n(EW) system, capable of \nexploding the proximity fuses \nin Necron missiles, is a standard \nfitting. \n \nThreat Detection: \nDeath Scorpions are equipped \nwith a variety of threat detectors. \nAround the AVS screen are 4 \ndetectors which are activated \nwhen different objects are in \nrange. The one marked 'B' lights \nup when there is an above- \nground structure nearby. \nSimilarly, the 'T' detector \nindicates a Talanite mine in close \nproximity, while 'W' warns of a \nweapon-armed alien. 'M' lights \nup when a Necron missile is \nabout to strike the craft. In \naddition, the \"Coral Sea\" will \nbeam down a message warning \nwhen a Necron missile launch \noccurs. \n\tAs an \"extra\" the Boffins have \nfitted a sophisticated Electronic \nIntelligent (Elint) computer. This \n---------------------------------- \nidentifies objects under the \ngunsight and puts up a \nmessage, and possibly a picture, \nusing HUDWAS. \n \nDamage: \nWhen a MURICC is hit by enemy \nfire, the energy shields are \ndamaged. Their condition is \nindicated on the 'E' light as a \ntwo figure number. The shields \nare part of the anti-grav thrust \nmotors which will fail when the \nshields energy rating = 0. The \ncraft will then be destroyed by \nthe first alien to hit it. \n \nCommunication: \nThe are two communication \nchannels. Selecting the \"Coral \nSea\" channel puts out a \nrendezvous call to the assault \ncarrier which is in low \ngeostationary orbit. You will be \ntractor-beamed up. The \n\"Zhukov\" channel requests heavy \nfire support from the \nbattle cruiser. This will destroy \nanything in the area and will do \nsome damage to your shields. \nNaval heavy cannon also \noverheat with repeated fire and \ntake a long time to cool. \n \nNavigation: \nThe geocompass is used for \nnavigation. \n \nPromotion: \nYou will be promoted if you \nundertake successful missions. \nMedals will be awarded for \ndistinguished service. Since the \nTerran Star Commandos have \nan exemplary combat record, \nfailure is not permitted. You will \nstart as a Drop Commando. \n \nGAMEPLAY \n \nA Kempston joystick can be used \nto control movement. 'Fire' fires \nthe cannon or an armed missile. \n\tFor keyboard control - \n'Y' = Forward, 'H' = Backwards, \n'O' = Left and 'P' = Right. Key 'J' \nsubstitutes for the fire button. \n \nSpectrum 48: \nThe ten icons along the bottom \nof the screen correspond to the \nten keys respectively on the \n---------------------------- \nbottom row of the keyboard \nreading from left to right. The two \nraised \"spaceship\" (\"Coral Sea\" & \n\"Zhukov\") keys correspond to the \nfar left and far right respectively \non the second row of keys from \nthe bottom. \n \nSpectrum 128: \nThe second row of keys from the \nbottom control the ten screen \nicons starting from Left to Right - \n'Caps Lock' to 'Caps Shift' \n'Space' switches AVS to \nMicrowave, 'A' to Rendezvous \n(\"Coral Sea\") and 'Enter' for Fire \nSupport (\"Zhukov\"). \n \n \n \nFunction \nAsks assault carrier for a rendezvous \n \nFunction \nAsks battle cruiser for fire support \n \nFunction \nArms AP Missile \n \nFunction \nArms CB Missile \n \nFunction \nSight mode puts the sight under joystick control \n(for cannon or Elint). Press again to move normally \n \nFunction \nFire Sonic Stunner \n \nFunction \nActivates EW system. Select a wave pattern \nusing the numeric keys 1 to 0 on the \nkeyboard and flick the joystick \nleft and right ('O' and 'P' for \nkeyboard) to change wave- \nphase. Find the right pattern and \nphase to destroy enemy missiles. \n'Space' switches off the system. \n \nFunction \nAsks Elint computer for an identification of \nthe object under the sight. \n \nFunction \nSwitches AVS to Natural Light \n \nFunction \nSwitches AVS to Infra Red \n \nFunction \nSwitches AVS to Ultra Violet \n \nFunction \nSwitches AVS to Microwave","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,10209,10213,36950,76722,57627,52752,26353,25955],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,1073741825],"publishers":[9519],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Sg5NcQxiGzA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/epk9gpyr1phlrbdvt8y3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"epk9gpyr1phlrbdvt8y3","width":600,"height":782}}
