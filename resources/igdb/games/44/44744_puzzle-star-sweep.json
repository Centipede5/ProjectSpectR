While the game is being played, star blocks and obstacles rise from the bottom of the screen while the player moves and rotates a cursor which determines where additional star blocks will be thrown into play from off-screen. The game features single-player and competitive play as well as a story mode featuring boss creatures and a bizarre plot -- apparently the whole game is actually a sport in which children poke a creature known as a star pig with sticks in order to make it vomit star blocks","rating":48.98022,"popularity":1,"total_rating":48.98022,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[95776,80174,19222,101563,87507,107249,90766,10225,88511,106275],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":854755200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":854755200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Feb-01","y":1997,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1i77.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1i77","width":640,"height":632}}
