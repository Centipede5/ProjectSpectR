There are four stages which are broken down into three stages each, for a total of twelve stages. When Wang gets knocked out, the game starts over at the beginning of the stage in which he got knocked out. Players can memorize the object\/enemy pattern in order to get through the stage more easily whenever Wang gets knocked out. At the end of each level, there is a boss fight. \n \nThe control was designed to be similar to the arcade game Kung-Fu Master, but with gameplay similar to Gladiator without the sword or shield held in hand. The graphics utilized very large character models that fill up the screen. They were capable of moving without any graphical flickering.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[114032,2254,44647,42855,12860,75964,38514,75962,44861,2252],"tags":[268435460],"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":567043200000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":567043200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Dec-21","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kzz0ndaf9nnge1rurchc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kzz0ndaf9nnge1rurchc","width":1402,"height":1406}}
