Players explore various caves, islands, and pirate ships while interacting with characters and solving puzzles. The game is presented in an irreverent and whimsical manner, which is reflected in the the dialogue; suggestive comments that contribute to the E-10+ rating are as follows: 'I like to get in on Manatee make-out sessions and ride merfolk around!'; 'You and Winslow were pretty hot and heavy, huh?'; and 'Hey, is it weird that I thought you were a little sexy when you were all poxed up?' Some scenes contain mild depictions of characters getting hit by darts, engaging in sword fights, or getting knocked down aboard ships. A scene with more impact depicts a ghost pirate getting stabbed multiple times\u2014though since he is a ghost, there is no apparent injury. During the course of the game, players can obtain grog from a vending machine; there is also a sequence in which a character gets hauled off to the 'drunk tank' for his unruly tavern behavior. The expletive 'hell' can be heard in the dialogue (e.g., 'Hell, I'll take it anyway.').","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/31170"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tales_of_Monkey_Island"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/monkeyisland.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tales_of_Monkey_Island"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.telltalegames.com\/talesofmonkeyisland\/"}]}
