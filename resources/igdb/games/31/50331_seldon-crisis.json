Skills do not limit access to modules and ships, but they augment their specialization and effectiveness. \n \nThere are four major NPC factions: The Foundation, The Tauri Dominion, The Solar Empire and The Kerrats. Together with countless minor factions they vie for control over the galaxy, constantly trying to gain the upper hand over one another on their home frontiers. But outside the core systems, in the majority of the galaxy anarchy reigns supreme and everything is free to be taken. Be careful when you venture out there and keep your friends close, but your enemies even closer.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1467331200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1467331200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Jul-01","y":2016,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/frfdnoyktwi94erfnjha.jpg","cloudinary_id":"frfdnoyktwi94erfnjha","width":1100,"height":700}}
