The voice speaks of the tower being trapped in a nightmare and commands that you enter its perilous halls and slay the 1,000 beasts that infest it.  \nGameplay is straightforward and focuses on engaging beasts in swiftly-executed combat, navigating hazardous areas of various effects called Terrain, and doing both in tandem in an \"obstacle course\" style of ever-increasing difficulty. Another focus is on the acquisition of magical Orbs that grant new abilities, and collecting equipment from difficult yet optional Lairs which makes the slaying of beasts and navigation of Terrain easier.  \n  \nThe player's progress is saved at the beginning of every new floor, and the use of Xbox gamepads is supported.","storyline":"Slay the 1,000 beasts and end the tower's nightmare.  \nHone your skills in direct and unforgiving combat.  \nNavigate treacherous terrain.  \nOvercome the tests of lairs and earn new equipment.  \nSeek out magical orbs and unleash their awesome powers.  \nFind your glory, beggar, if even just in the moments before your death.  \nHeed the call.","popularity":2.666666666666667,"tags":[1073741827],"developers":[12679],"publishers":[12679],"game_engines":[79],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[126,524,538,905,2472,2563,2904],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[25,32],"first_release_date":1491868800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1491868800000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Apr-11","y":2017,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ctji4h2fzdokawpll9kw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctji4h2fzdokawpll9kw","width":347,"height":311},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kgyyiaf4mso0v5f4qqvw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kgyyiaf4mso0v5f4qqvw","width":347,"height":311},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lecducygqwqbhxvy1mev.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lecducygqwqbhxvy1mev","width":347,"height":311},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rqerdcxrvmi98rvg8wrp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rqerdcxrvmi98rvg8wrp","width":347,"height":311}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/idzgop2wdhxx3vqz1n6b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"idzgop2wdhxx3vqz1n6b","width":347,"height":311},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/nick-antonopoulos.itch.io\/the-sword"}]}
