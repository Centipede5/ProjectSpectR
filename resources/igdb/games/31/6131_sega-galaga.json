However, the enemies in Galaga have the power to steal your ship to use as reinforcements (meaning the player loses a life). However, if you are able to destroy the enemy who has captured your ship, you are able to pilot both ships at once, doubling your firepower at the expense of being a bigger target. \n \nThough Sega-Galaga is essentially the same game as the arcade original, the limitations of the SG-1000 means the graphics and sound are not quite as advanced. Also the \"challenging stages\" have been omitted, meaning each stage is identical to the last.","popularity":1,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[84,64],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":84,"date":441676800000,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":64,"date":441676800000,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30bb\u30ac\u30fb\u30ae\u30e3\u30e9\u30ac"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yhvn3btrfkikf6vkxmka.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yhvn3btrfkikf6vkxmka","width":400,"height":553}}
