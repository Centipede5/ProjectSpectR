Events happen in real-time and you must make decisions based on the evidence surrounding you. \n \nIs the cost of an extreme action outweighed by the cause of the greater good? \n \nYou are the reporter. You decide the narrative.","hypes":5,"popularity":7.333333333333333,"games":[79999,26163,110808,54678,26223,103054,19150,103266,55080,20329],"tags":[20,23,43,268435487,268435488,536871029,536871044,536872267,536872286,536872890,536876219,536877758,536879133,536888023,536888066,536888067,536888068,536888069,536888070,1073741825],"developers":[2513],"publishers":[4996],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[117,132,1355,1374,1978,5307,6846,8221,17111,17154,17155,17156,17157,17158],"themes":[20,23,43],"genres":[31,32],"first_release_date":1549324800000,"pulse_count":15,"platforms":[6,48,49],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1549324800000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Feb-05","y":2019,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1549324800000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Feb-05","y":2019,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1549324800000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Feb-05","y":2019,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nx8qo8hbanigcphnexkm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nx8qo8hbanigcphnexkm","width":1920,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sv5dm0djugpwb1gwq8db.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sv5dm0djugpwb1gwq8db","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/imdp03m7023r4auhub8s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"imdp03m7023r4auhub8s","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pxmkim7enpt9iy8qsbjo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pxmkim7enpt9iy8qsbjo","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/za2nomvgu9honcskbz83.jpg","cloudinary_id":"za2nomvgu9honcskbz83","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"uLJjs4Knsgc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fapdmfpo0x8kgp4xiisr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fapdmfpo0x8kgp4xiisr","width":600,"height":800},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UChYX4YOEhfEs4M15_OsZheA"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/whitepapergames"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/whitepapergames"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/whitepapergames"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Occupation"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/765880"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/occupation-game.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"765880"}}
