The energy gauge gives the chance to perform special attacks or call in help from Tuxedo Mask, who throws roses to pop the highest row of balloons. This gauge increases once every other time a shot destroyed a balloon. If the energy gauge is full, the Sailor Senshi character can perform a special attack.","collection":3094,"franchise":755,"franchises":[755],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[25222,51464,18167,8197,26223,60044,71148,38274,22481,14047],"tags":[27,268435465,268435489,536870990,536871878,536871881,536873787,536875054,536875291,536875472,536876694,1073741828],"developers":[1722],"publishers":[617],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[78,966,969,2875,4142,4379,4560,5782],"themes":[27],"genres":[9,33],"first_release_date":818380800000,"pulse_count":14,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":818380800000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Dec-08","y":1995,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sailor Moon Super S: Floating Panic","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Super S: Floating Panic"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jteqyn6q7kpik3tzc5iw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jteqyn6q7kpik3tzc5iw","width":256,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sbwxa03k7nr1fdruboth.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sbwxa03k7nr1fdruboth","width":256,"height":224}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"AvBFH20r1jE"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oelbm2kbdk1eardmtygr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oelbm2kbdk1eardmtygr","width":960,"height":530},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/sailormoon.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bishoujo_Senshi_Sailor_Moon_SuperS:_Fuwa_Fuwa_Panic"}]}
