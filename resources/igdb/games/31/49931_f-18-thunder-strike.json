In this one-player flight sim, you take the role of a daring pilot who's flying an elite fighter jet. Slide into an inside-the-cockpit view, battle against multiple enemies, and practice your aerial combat and evasion maneuvers to prove your air superiority. You can play in either Arcade or Simulation mode, each affording you a unique experience. Arcade mode offers looser controls that make things easier for rookie pilots, while experts will want to jump right into Simulation mode, which will challenge the ability of even the most experienced flyboy. Head into multiple missions of dogfighting action and perform aerial tricks that will break the sound barrier, but don't think that it's all fun and games. When the mission's complete, you'll have to carefully land your jet on an aircraft carrier.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[34919,19341,25311,54999,28465,37419,44242,36608,55715,33603],"tags":[1,268435469,536870968,536871904],"category":0,"keywords":[56,992],"themes":[1],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":959817600000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":959817600000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jun-01","y":2000,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fpjqxykvdzzr5b3frcdr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fpjqxykvdzzr5b3frcdr","width":200,"height":200},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
