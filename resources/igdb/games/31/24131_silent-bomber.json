You play as a character named Jutah Fate, a genetically engineered man created by the government. You're an expert at using bombs. You start out being able to set only a few bombs at a time, but eventually you can increase the number by collecting E-Chips. It's a fast paced game of blowing things up before they blow you up.","popularity":2,"games":[68287,36950,11253,27314,28029,64204,25300,71455,19448,142],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871079,536871859,536871882,536872131,536872957,536874745,536875199,536875262,536875910,536875954,536879992,536880837,536884863,1073741827],"developers":[12992],"publishers":[141,617],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[167,947,970,1219,2045,3833,4287,4350,4998,5042,9080,9925,13951],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":941068800000,"platforms":[45,7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1164067200000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Nov-21","y":2006,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":963532800000,"region":1,"human":"2000-Jul-14","y":2000,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":951782400000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Feb-29","y":2000,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":941068800000,"region":5,"human":"1999-Oct-28","y":1999,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30b5\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30dc\u30de\u30fc","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dcl3tvjmxqfrobwtypcr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dcl3tvjmxqfrobwtypcr","width":640,"height":640},"esrb":{"synopsis":"-","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Silent_Bomber"}]}
