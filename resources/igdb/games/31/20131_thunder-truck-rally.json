Not the only game to twist the racing genre to this end, but as you'd expect from Psygnosis, the quality of presentation is head and shoulders above the rest. \n \nThere are two types of courses; circuits offer demanding hilly terrains which can easily trash the vehicle and must be learned intimately. Endurance courses offer greater freedom, with the aim of finding the best route to link eight dispersed checkpoints. \n \nTo avoid any disorientation, arrows guide you to the next marker. Each area, be it snowy or volcanic, has characteristic features and hazards, yet this doesn't stop a repetitive feel developing. The third option is a fun mode, and one you might expect from the developer of Destruction Derby. Players have sixty seconds to take their truck on a car smashing spree.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[67625,58785,78637,44930,41114,22823,6515,40470,45079,44332],"tags":[268435466,268435470,536872078,536874337,536875069,536875117,536876293],"category":0,"keywords":[1166,3425,4157,4205,5381],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":867715200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":867715200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Jul-01","y":1997,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Monster Trucks","comment":"European title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qmawltdnri4awvoaif8a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qmawltdnri4awvoaif8a","width":800,"height":968}}
