The letter informs them of a terrible disaster: Mangar's master, the Mad God Tarjan, has unleashed his wrath upon the town of Skara Brae, completely destroying in. The heroes visit a refugee camp nearby and embark on a quest to defeat Tarjan. \n \nThief of Fate is the third installment in the Bard's Tale series, and a sequel to The Destiny Knight. It is similar to its predecessors, being a first-person fantasy role-playing game in which the player explores maze-like pseudo-3D towns, dungeons, and wilderness areas. Two new character classes have been added: Geomancer and Chronomancer. There are more dungeons than in the previous games, and this installment also adds an auto-mapping feature. The game's world is divided into separate realms accessed by using time warps, each with its own theme and setting - including, among others, famous locations from Earth's history such as ancient Rome or Berlin during World War II.","collection":629,"franchise":556,"franchises":[556],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[26766,11214,12632,36534,18398,36926,2430,47823,19698,17583],"tags":[17,268435468,536871139,536871208,536871938,536873384,536875196,536875455,536875531,536875614,536877028,536878505,536879130,536879765,536880563,1073741825],"developers":[903],"publishers":[1],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[227,296,1026,2472,4284,4543,4619,4702,6116,7593,8218,8853,9651],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[13,16,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":694137600000,"region":2,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":662601600000,"region":2,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ulnowfx0klj4ksxshufm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ulnowfx0klj4ksxshufm","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lo4yzhfeyfmpv9nbqoc5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lo4yzhfeyfmpv9nbqoc5","width":560,"height":384},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xkl4l1lg5alkiktfwjnt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xkl4l1lg5alkiktfwjnt","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jrx0ccstuxgmxpmryfla.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jrx0ccstuxgmxpmryfla","width":1993,"height":2629},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
