Your defense: a bunch of potted plants hanging over your balcony. As the bugs climb the wall, push the pots over the edge and knock the bugs off. If six bugs get into your building through the window, they'll eat away at the foundation until the building drops a bit. Then the bugs will have a shorter wall to climb, and things get harder. This game is original, challenging, and pretty addictive.
