This game saw Pond and friends competing in the underwater Olympics. \n \nThe events take the form of various mini-games, usually in the same vein as Hyper Sports, but with an aquatic theme and the humour seen in the James Pond series (e.g. The 100 Metre Splash). More unusual mini-games include Kipper Watching, which involves 'heading' incoming beach balls away from a troop of sleeping seals, and Gymnastics. Events can be played with up to 4 players.","popularity":1,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":752112000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":752112000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Nov-01","y":1993,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nanpndcmby7cgnacrpgz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nanpndcmby7cgnacrpgz","width":1024,"height":703}}
