Always looking for an adventure, Adol joins him and soon finds out the cause of this new evil. \n \nYs III: Wanderers from Ys breaks away from the \"bumping into enemies\" battle system of the first two games, allowing Adol to control his sword in a variety of directions. Beside changing the battle system, the game's perspective switches to a side-scrolling view, as opposed to the top-down one of the previous games. Adol also has the ability to jump now. New to the series is the use of magical rings, which give Adol different powering-up abilities such as healing and shielding. The game also uses various key items found along the way to solve minor puzzles and progress the story.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,16468,55289,59516,49414,28010,34294,25636,1224,25311],"tags":[1,268435468],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}]}
