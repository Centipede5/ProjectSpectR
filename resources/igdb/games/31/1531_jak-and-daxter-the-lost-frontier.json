Players explore fantasy environments, interact with whimsical characters, and dispatch 'Dark Eco warriors' through a combination of melee and shooting attacks. Players can use futuristic laser weapons and oversized machine guns to blast at robots, 'eco eels,' and three-legged walkers that all disappear in a flash of purple light; these enemies also leave behind 'dark eco' (purple orbs) that can be picked up and used for weapon\/power upgrades. Air missions (roughly 40% of gameplay) sometimes require players to attack enemies and floating stations: from a third-person perspective, players shoot lasers and launch rockets at airborne pirate ships that explode into a burst of light. The game's combat is supplemented by cutscenes that are mostly irreverent in tone; aside from a brief depiction of armpit-sniffing (e.g., a character sniffs, then says, 'No worse than usual'), the crude humor is mostly stated in dialogue: 'kanga-rabbits are gonna fly out of my fuzzy butt' and  'At least you didn't say the exit's through the rear.' The dialogue occasionally ventures into suggestive innuendo with comments like 'She's being entertained by the captain . . . if you know what I mean' and 'Ahh, not much for small talk are you'\u2014a line delivered by a woman named Danger Sexy Pirate. The expletive 'damn' can also be heard on occasion.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence towards non human looking characters - Non realistic looking violence towards human characters.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/jakanddaxter.wikia.com\/"}]}
