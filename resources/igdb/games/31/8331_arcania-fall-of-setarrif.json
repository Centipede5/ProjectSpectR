As players complete missions and interact with various characters, they use swords, bows, and magical attacks to kill human foes and fantasy creatures (e.g., goblins, golems, skeletons). Battles depict melee-style combat, accompanied by shrieks and cries of pain as enemies are slashed, electrocuted, or lit on fire. Injured characters emit brief spurts of blood when hit. Some quests demand the slaying of specific adversaries (e.g., a pack of 12 \u201cdemon wolves\u201d), and players may be rewarded with experience\/skill points. As the game progresses, some of the dialogue contains suggestive remarks (e.g., \u201c[The neighboring island's women] might be after my willy, innut? . . . there are worse things in life than letting a hot chick nibble on you!\u201d). In one sequence, players' character can smoke from a hookah pipe. The words \u201csh*t,\u201d \u201ct*ts,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.
