The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person RPGs in which users select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, snake beast) and an action (e.g., 'attack,' 'kill,' magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage with splashes of blood; large pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. Cutscenes may depict an imprisoned innocent kicked into a lava pit, a fire golem tearing a man in half, or an insect-like creature feasting on the entrails of the dead. Some characters engage in suggestive dialogue\u2014mostly a dwarf character that makes several comments about sex, mistresses, and breasts. In one sequence, a demon character appears topless.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence.","rating":5},"external":{"steam":"47730"}}
