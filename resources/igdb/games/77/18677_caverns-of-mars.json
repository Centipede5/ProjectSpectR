Fuel must be collected along the way, and at the bottom of the last level a Martian base must be destroyed. Horizontal sections provide variety, scrolling is smooth, and the fast paced, though methodical shooting action is intensely enjoyable, making this a truly addictive game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,36950,76722,76246,19341,306,64204,17522,10039],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,1073741826],"developers":[855],"publishers":[9380],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[65],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r72ewueu5cmdrbei9nwx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r72ewueu5cmdrbei9nwx","width":800,"height":1038}}
