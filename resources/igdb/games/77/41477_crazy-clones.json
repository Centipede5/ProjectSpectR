In Crazy Clones, you are the one real person in a sea of clones. You must tag as many clones as possible while avoiding the Clone Master. When the Clone Master touches a clone, a new clone is produced. When the Clone Master touches you, the game is over. \n \nNote: If you tag all of the clones without letting the Clone Master create a new clone, you're hosed.","popularity":1,"category":0,"first_release_date":886291200000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":886291200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}]}
