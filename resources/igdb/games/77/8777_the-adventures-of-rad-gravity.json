The game is a platformer with a wacky storyline in which the eponymous main character explored multiple planets and fought enemies while jumping through levels. The game was notable for the planet Turvia, where gravity works in reverse. In that level the protagonist was drawn upside down, as were the enemies and the entire screen. The main character has a comically large head and strongly resembles actor Bruce Campbell. His early game attack consists of a sort of a lightsaber.","storyline":"The story is that in the far future, humans colonized many planets and established a form a biotechnology, which were sentient beings called Compuminds, which could communicate rapidly from world to world. The game's villain had shut down all the Compuminds and hid them. Eventually one of the Compuminds, named Kakos, was found. Rad Gravity is the name of the game's hero. Together, Rad and Kakos must find the eight missing Compuminds, each on eight different unique planets, such as the cyberpunk world of Cyberia, the green jungle world of Sauria, and the caustic trash world of Effluvia.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,27314,10039,21063,19174,44544,28029,25300,64204],"tags":[1,18,27,268435461,268435464,536871015,536871038,536871049,536871298,536871487,536871859,536871882,536872009,536872039,536872961,536875209,536875326,536875847,536876028,536876293,536876348,1073741828],"developers":[1882],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[103,126,137,386,575,947,970,1097,1127,2049,4297,4414,4935,5116,5381,5436],"themes":[1,18,27],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":660009600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":18,"date":660009600000,"human":"1990-Dec","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":675561600000,"region":1,"human":"1991-May-30","y":1991,"m":5},{"category":2,"platform":18,"date":694137600000,"region":3,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d6mqpuw2jwsz54u5kern.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d6mqpuw2jwsz54u5kern","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lrx3rxswzkabphqrosrf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lrx3rxswzkabphqrosrf","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/abkzhwnm1w5ofoklvtot.jpg","cloudinary_id":"abkzhwnm1w5ofoklvtot","width":512,"height":448}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"yDXFkbe1WeI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rhpiqskwmsgnndzb7dop.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rhpiqskwmsgnndzb7dop","width":220,"height":320}}
