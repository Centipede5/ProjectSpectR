It was later ported to the Sega Mega Drive. While the game is essentially a standard horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up, it has an innovation that makes it unique in the genre. The player flies a spaceship (specifically, a bioship) which has the standard forward guns to be found in all horizontal scrollers, but it also possesses a weapon that can be manually targeted with a crosshair, in the same manner as in the game Missile Command. This allows the player to fire in any direction with pinpoint accuracy, and adds an extra level of strategy to the game. The game saw an almost arcade perfect port on the Sega Mega Drive. What few changes there were actually enhanced the look of the game such as added parallax scrolling backgrounds in level 2.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,10209,10213,28029,36950,64204,10210,10212,27314,71455],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871882],"category":0,"keywords":[166,970],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":640224000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":640224000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Apr-16","y":1990,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Bioship Paladin\nSpace Battleship Gomora\nUch\u016b Senkan Gomorrah\n\u5b87\u5b99\u6226\u8266\u30b4\u30e2\u30e9","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vzopbl4lxhp6btaojrlj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vzopbl4lxhp6btaojrlj","width":596,"height":178}}
