Events include boot throwing (similar to hammer throwing), pizza balancing, and sack racing, among others. In the background, landmarks unique to Italy are shown (i.e., Leaning Tower of Pisa) and the structures using Roman architecture (i.e., the Colosseum) are shown while the player competes at the six events. A majority of the game seems to be ported from the Commodore 64 video game Alternative World Games by Gremlin Interactive.","collection":3932,"franchise":1120,"franchises":[1120],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[10620,22690,15851,19565,23733,27091,95028,51524,71226,30830],"tags":[1,268435470,536871186,536872078,536872475,536872847,536872981,536873303,536874452,536875054,536875074,536875079,536875088,536875222,536875240,536875291,536875292,536875717,536876528,536877431,1073741828],"developers":[1848],"publishers":[1848],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[274,1166,1563,1935,2069,2391,3540,4142,4162,4167,4176,4310,4328,4379,4380,4805,5616,6519],"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":590889600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":590889600000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Sep-22","y":1988,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ctwkfjlb0bcskqepymvx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctwkfjlb0bcskqepymvx","width":1528,"height":2100}}
