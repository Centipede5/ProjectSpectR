Her dragon, Arokh, tells her that he hears a voice that calls them to the city of Surdana. There, they find out that race of three-faced monsters, called Desert Lords, have been terrorizing the human population recently. In order to fight them, the humans need powerful allies. But the gateway to the world of dragons has been sealed, and only a dragon of the Elder Breed can open it. Rynn and Arokh must now venture to the dragon world, restore the bond between humans and dragons, and defeat the Desert Lords. \n \nDrakan: The Ancients' Gates is an action game with RPG elements.
