The genius scientist Dr Ginn Chaos has gone missing. Before his disappearance, he was actively working in his large mansion on a device allowing access to alternate dimensions. Armed only with a knife, his brother decides to look for him and ultimately unveil the mystery behind the incident. Something obviously went terribly wrong with Dr. Chaos's experiment, and the goal of the game is to locate all the eleven dimensional warp-zones hidden within the mansion, as well as assembling a powerful laser gun, the only weapon capable of taking down the last boss. \n \nWas also released in America for the Nintendo Entertainment System but lacks the saving abilities of the Famicom Disk System version.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[12579,25646,70385,68142,36608,28148,43210,34919,40524,23175],"tags":[1,19],"category":0,"themes":[1,19],"first_release_date":1468800000000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":1468800000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Jul-18","y":2016,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xgzrkfnfhgdrc8cklkby.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xgzrkfnfhgdrc8cklkby","width":922,"height":947}}
