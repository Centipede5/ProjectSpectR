It is a sequel to Super Monaco GP, but this time the game is sponsored by Ayrton Senna (who won the Monaco Grand Prix six times). Also unlike the previous game, Super Monaco GP II was not released in arcades or for any non-Sega console or computer. \n \nAt the time of release it was regarded as the most realistic racing experience on home video game consoles, and the fact that it was endorsed by Ayrton Senna meant the game was very popular. However, due to these celebrity endorsements, it is unlikely Super Monaco GP II will be re-released without cutbacks.","collection":2611,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,36662,24918,26709,6250,7142,40470,19419,58785,13861],"tags":[1,268435466,536871294,536873747,536874337,536874398,536874813,536875069,536875117,536875464,536875955,536876108,536876779,536878517,536882383,1073741825],"developers":[9723],"publishers":[9723],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[382,2835,3425,3486,3901,4157,4205,4552,5043,5196,5867,7605,11471],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":711331200000,"platforms":[29,35,64],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":714960000000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Aug-28","y":1992,"m":8},{"category":2,"platform":64,"date":725760000000,"region":1,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":711331200000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jul-17","y":1992,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP 2","comment":"Other"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"MVJVAGiBR7A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/efvo5ezzbj1uvdgwreki.jpg","cloudinary_id":"efvo5ezzbj1uvdgwreki","width":282,"height":397},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ayrton_Senna%27s_Super_Monaco_GP_II"}]}
