There are three stars to collect, plus a portal that allows you to proceed to the next level. You move Qub by tapping anywhere on the part of the screen that\u2019s the direction you want him to go. To be most precise, you can tap the arrows in the four corners of your screen. If there\u2019s a ledge that\u2019s short enough to jump up to, he will automatically jump to it. Walk Qub onto thin air and he\u2019ll fall and lose a star, but return just as cheerful as ever. Nothing, and I mean nothing, wipes the smile off this little guy\u2019s face. \n \nBesides controlling Qub, you rotate the entire planet by swiping the screen in any direction. This is how you get Qub to different sides of the planet. Fans of Monument Valley may feel at home with this control scheme. But be careful! Unlike Monument Valley, you can fall off the planet, and there are consequences for it. And it can be a bit frustrating sometimes when you accidentally walk off the edge. The \u201cimpossible architecture\u201d concept of Monument Valley also does not apply here. Just because it seems like two blocks connect from one angle, doesn\u2019t mean they do. You need to make sure from every angle that you\u2019re lined up with a block before you rely on it to catch you.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25646,76253,28070,103312,20342,109458,24426,95776,76747,87507],"tags":[1,268435465,536872172,536875072,536875439,536880306,1073741827],"developers":[14467],"publishers":[1493],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":16200,"normally":20700,"completely":25200},"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1260,4160,4527,9394],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1419984000000,"platforms":[34,39],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":39,"date":1419984000000,"region":8,"human":"2014","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":34,"date":1419984000000,"region":8,"human":"2014","y":2014,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rm9p63anv0rw1kpalvxs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rm9p63anv0rw1kpalvxs","width":1280,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iakbqvtawwbwkaeqjbvk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iakbqvtawwbwkaeqjbvk","width":1200,"height":900},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ct4tjscwif3c8pal7ueh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ct4tjscwif3c8pal7ueh","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ud0teoi1rka627hlz6tr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ud0teoi1rka627hlz6tr","width":1280,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dgac6urhgn5zr2h36u4s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dgac6urhgn5zr2h36u4s","width":750,"height":563},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ncyvczmnqqdzdqdu5qoi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ncyvczmnqqdzdqdu5qoi","width":642,"height":361},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/usitcdircjk9g2i8i3ry.jpg","cloudinary_id":"usitcdircjk9g2i8i3ry","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zcj2cswwenfablgfu3sw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zcj2cswwenfablgfu3sw","width":1280,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gf83zkriekcvxnukkiak.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gf83zkriekcvxnukkiak","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rbmvg0yat9dhzjsvfj77.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rbmvg0yat9dhzjsvfj77","width":520,"height":293}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"6ey6f9H4paE"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ocUU4_Oj23E"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tyb8mskgkd0zky32zx6c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tyb8mskgkd0zky32zx6c","width":630,"height":630},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.firstsightgames.twistyplanets&hl=en"},{"category":5,"url":"http:\/\/\u2022 https:\/\/twitter.com\/cm_games"},{"category":4,"url":"http:\/\/\u2022 https:\/\/facebook.com\/crescentmoongames"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/\u2022 http:\/\/crescentmoongames.com\/other-games\/"}]}
