When someone dies in Upsilon Circuit, they can never play again. When you are chosen to play, the world watches, and everyone has a hand in your journey, both friend and foe. \n \nEach Contestant explores the overworld and generated dungeons in search of the Dream Tech Crystals. They fight monsters, avoid traps, and compete with the opposing team. \n \nWhen the Contestant fights monsters or gets treasure, the EXP and other rewards go to the Audience. EXP is used collectively by the Audience to level up the Contestant's Skill Tree. Simply put, the Audience is part dungeon master, part strategist, and part judge & jury.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55092,11560,22747,19376,47823,26766,36926,25300,12632,19290],"tags":[536871029,536871208,536871684,536871938,536871945,536875046,536875299,536876228],"developers":[3832],"category":0,"keywords":[117,296,772,1026,1033,4134,4387,5316],"pulse_count":2,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zvsgnwuqa8hk87oqu7ah.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zvsgnwuqa8hk87oqu7ah","width":1262,"height":400},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/upsiloncircuit.com\/"}]}
