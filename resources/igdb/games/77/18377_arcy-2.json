You play a smiley face who must collect all of the keys in a level before you can leave. Each enemy moves in a specific way, so the puzzle is figuring out how to move through the level without getting killed. Some enemies will only move if you cross their path, some will kill you instantly, some move in straight lines and only turn left or right, and some will try to trap you. Rocks can be used to interpose something between yourself and your enemies, and sometimes must be used to destroy walls or barriers. The soundtrack gets old quickly (one stanza of \"The Entertainer\" plays in a loop forever), but the game is very challenging and should entertain anyone who is up to the challenge. There are 3 volumes in this game, with only the first volume playable in the shareware version.","popularity":1,"category":0,"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"20XDOwvoQ6c"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/owytlxtwz80n1mt8tjeh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"owytlxtwz80n1mt8tjeh","width":640,"height":400}}
