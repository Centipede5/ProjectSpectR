From a \u00be-overhead perspective, players traverse landscapes and engage in turn-based combat to kill humans and fantastical creatures (e.g., orcs, giant insects). Characters use swords, staffs, spears, and magic attacks to kill enemies. Combat is highlighted by frequent screams of pain, impact sounds, and large blood-splatter effects. Some areas depict large pools of blood amid human corpses and dismembered limbs.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/373420"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.divinityoriginalsin-enhanced.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"373420"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":2,"offlinemax":2},{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false},{"platform":48,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
