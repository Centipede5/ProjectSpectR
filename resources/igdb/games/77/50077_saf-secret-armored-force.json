Even the scrolling runs perfectly smooth, and there are real transparency effects, which are not too common with DOS games overall. \n \nAlthough not a sequel per se, the game soon evokes memories of lazenca, not only because the player once again takes place in a mecha. Instead of having to chose between two models, though, the machine in SAF unites the agility of the Ripple with the weapons and jetpacks of the Cyber-Troll and for good measure throws in the left & right fire buttons of the shmup sequences in lazenca. Weapons can be upgraded in two levels, and filling the upgrade meter above that unleashes a devastating special attack particular to that weapon. During the first four stages weapons get gradually unlocked. After the initial machine gun follow a frame thrower, a grenade launcher and a laser cannon.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":862185600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":862185600000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Apr-28","y":1997,"m":4}]}
