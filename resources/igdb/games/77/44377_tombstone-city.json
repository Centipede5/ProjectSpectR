You must destroy them by shooting them from your \"schooner\". When you kill them, they turn into cactuses which create obstacles on the map. But if you kill a Morg while it is adjacent to an existing cactus, the Morg and the cactus are both eliminated from the map. \n \nTombstone City was known as Saguaro City in Prototype but was later changed.
