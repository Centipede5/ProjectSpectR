(branded Burnout CRASH!) is a downloadable action driving title in the Burnout video game series. It is developed by Criterion Games and published by Electronic Arts for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, iOS and Android via PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, iTunes App Store and Google Play Store. \n \nIn Burnout Crash!, players drive into an intersection and attempt to cause as big a pile-up as possible. Unlike previous games in the series, Burnout Crash! is played from a bird's-eye or aerial view. Points are earned for causing damage and destroying the environment and other vehicles. Leaderboards powered by EA's Autolog service enable players to compare scores with other players. \n \nThe game features three game modes and six different intersections to play, as well as seven drivable vehicles, for example the Vegas Saloon. The Xbox 360 version of the game also includes a Kinect mode, allowing players to use gestures to control the game.","collection":515,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":72,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":72,"total_rating_count":6,"games":[3047,56033,3772,20329,55173,1886,19539,6250,1050,7333],"tags":[1,268435465,268435466,268435489,536871644,536871647,536871783,536872205,536872511,536872590,536872594,536872695,536872954,536873064,536873753,536874337,536874743,536874767,536874896,536874906,536875046,536875073,536875117,536875258,536875271,536875645,536876260,536876261,536876703,536877388,536877999,536878071,536879193,536880084,536881679,536883074,536883075,536888127,536892470,536892471,1073741827],"developers":[347],"publishers":[1,712],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[732,735,871,1293,1599,1678,1682,1783,2042,2152,2841,3425,3831,3855,3984,3994,4134,4161,4205,4346,4359,4733,5348,5349,5791,6476,7087,7159,8281,9172,10767,12162,12163,17215,21558,21559],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,10,33],"first_release_date":1316476800000,"platforms":[39,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1316563200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Sep-21","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1316563200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Sep-21","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1316476800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Sep-20","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1316563200000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Sep-21","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1316563200000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Sep-21","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1334188800000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Apr-12","y":2012,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/djb1kitgzzbhwconm6a8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"djb1kitgzzbhwconm6a8","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k1rkzdhbwcwivmjojxqc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k1rkzdhbwcwivmjojxqc","width":640,"height":878},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action game in which players earn points for creating traffic pileups. From a top-down perspective, players initiate crashes by driving \"cartoony\" vehicles (e.g., cars, trucks, vans, buses) into busy intersections; multiple crashes trigger score multipliers and rack up large \"bills\" of property damage. Each level is accompanied by crashing sounds, small explosions, and vocal encouragement (e.g., \"Cool,\" \"Maximum Carnage!\"). In some levels, players are instructed to crash into police cars (e.g., \"Crash them before they bust you!\"); in other sequences, oversized airplanes, tornadoes, lobster monsters, and UFOs slide across the screen, destroying any vehicles in their path.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Violence that is not shown but is implied","rating":1},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.ea.com\/ca\/burnout-crash"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Burnout_Crash!"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/burnout.wikia.com\/wiki\/Burnout_CRASH!"}]}
