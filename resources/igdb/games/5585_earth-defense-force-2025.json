Players use lasers, machine guns, turrets, and rockets launchers to destroy alien robots, spacecraft and creatures (e.g., ants, spiders, dragons). Players can also use jet packs, tanks, and helicopters to fight enemies in frenetic combat. Battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire and large explosions. Large splashes of red blood frequently appear when creatures are hit and when human characters are attacked.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.edf2025.com\/"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
