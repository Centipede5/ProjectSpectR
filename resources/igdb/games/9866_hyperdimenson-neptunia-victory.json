Combat is turn-based, and damage is indicated by impact sounds and a loss of hit points. During the course of the game, some female characters are dressed in low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage and\/or buttocks; one bathing sequence depicts female bodies partially obscured by hot-spring mist and soap suds.

Mine get big when I transform\u201d \u201cWait, is she a dominatrix\u2026?\u201d \u201cI'm sorry for all the foreplay\u201d and \u201cEven if you get groped a bit, or get into some kinky stuff, you'll end up able to transform.\u201d).
