Players can advance their nation's technology, manage its economic and social infrastructure (e.g., diplomacy, trade), and expand territory through military conquests. Battles occur from an overhead perspective on gridded maps, depicting brief sword\/gun fights and vehicular warfare between small army units. Entries from the game's \u201cCivilopedia\u201d include additional descriptions of violence (e.g., \u201c[He] took the encamped Huns unaware and massacred them,\u201d \u201c[O]ne of his friends and retainers committed seppuku (ritual suicide) in humiliation.\u201d), and one introductory video depicts realistic soldiers fighting with swords, axes, and bows. Some in-game text includes suggestive material (e.g., \u201cHe [amused] himself with hunting, court parties, and sexual pursuits\u201d and \u201cWu became concubine of Emperor Taizong.\u201d) or historical references to the opium trade (e.g., [T]he Qing rulers objected, and attempted to seize incoming opium shipments, inciting the First Opium War in 1839.). The word \u201chell\u201d appears in the dialogue.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.civilization5.com\/godsandkings\/us\/info.php"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":6,"onlinecoopmax":6,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
