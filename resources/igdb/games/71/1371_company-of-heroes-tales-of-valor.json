Presented from a top-down perspective, the game allows players to position troops and issue commands ('open fire' and various 'attack, defend, move' commands) to accumulate resource points and increase veteran status. Soldiers use machine guns, grenades, flamethrowers, and mortar to kill enemies who react by screaming in pain or emitting puffs of red blood. During one sequence, an armored vehicle with a shredder dismembers soldiers on the battlefield. Strong profanity (e.g., 'f*ck' and 'sh*t') can be heard in the dialogue and radio chatter.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.companyofheroesgame.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/20540"}],"external":{"steam":"20540"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
