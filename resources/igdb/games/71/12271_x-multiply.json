Instead of the Force pod, however, the main power-up apparatus takes the form of two flexible tentacles. The tentacles are invulnerable to all enemy attacks, and can be positioned with careful maneuvering of the X-002. \nThe game centers around an unusual alien invasion against a colony planet in the year 2249\u2014the aliens themselves are microscopic creatures that invade, infect, and kill the colonists. Scientists have deployed the microscopic fighter X-002 into the body of the hapless woman whose body has been invaded by the alien queen.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,10209,10213,36950,76722,57627,52752,47144,26353],"tags":[18,268435461,268435489,1073741828],"publishers":[1287],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":631065600000,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ez218d2c2p7r61j13uug.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ez218d2c2p7r61j13uug","width":850,"height":1200}}
