With Unidad\u2019s military force unable to maintain control over Bolivia, the country is in a state of civil war. To help restore order, the Unidad enlists cartel members, veterans, mercenaries and criminals from various nearby countries as volunteers. Together, they form a new brutal special unit: Los Extranjeros, which is ordered to track and eliminate all American agents.  \n  \nIn this chaotic situation, the Ghosts have one last mission: evacuate the last CIA members and American civilians remaining in the country. Shot down en route to their mission, the Ghosts find themselves in the middle of the jungle, without external support, facing deadly enemies equipped with the latest gear and technology.   \n  \nThe Fallen Ghosts campaign will feature 15 new missions in which players will have to take down four new bosses located in three different regions. In the expansion, players will start with a new character at level 30 and equipped with all of the main game skills. The level cap will increase from 30 to 35, and players will be able to unlock nine new skills including physical, weapon and drones skills.  \n  \nFallen Ghosts also features six exclusive new weapons ranging from new assault rifles, sniper rifles and a crossbow that can be equipped with explosive arrows.  \n  \nFinally, the more hardcore players will be pleased to know that the advanced and expert difficulties have been tweaked to offer an even higher challenge. By turning the HUD off players will get the most extreme and tactical experience possible in Ghost Recon Wildlands.","popularity":2,"game":11171,"games":[83728,102868,26845,19549,113111,103210,8422,19686,103301,76747],"tags":[39,268435461,268435480,536871016,536872241,1073741826],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[104,1329],"themes":[39],"genres":[5,24],"pulse_count":1,"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aoendcrhztr4zc2nqsx6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aoendcrhztr4zc2nqsx6","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wskxlp8ljudigdxzy2cj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wskxlp8ljudigdxzy2cj","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tgfhjysyydgztnklyoft.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tgfhjysyydgztnklyoft","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xqwkbxv6xy4xaoioy5x9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xqwkbxv6xy4xaoioy5x9","width":3840,"height":2160},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wiozivfri9clokp16qto.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wiozivfri9clokp16qto","width":3840,"height":2160}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar4un.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar4un","width":1500,"height":1060}],"videos":[{"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"jc-LNFeb7v0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oxqkgv8dj2qhtpkyi4aj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oxqkgv8dj2qhtpkyi4aj","width":5329,"height":6000}}
