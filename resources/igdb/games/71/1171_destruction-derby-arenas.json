Because this is now on the PS2, the capabilities are much higher, so now there is a vastly improved graphics engine, physics engine, and levels. \n \nThere are now loads of online play modes to try, with up to 19 other racers online with you, and now, the crashes are bigger than ever.","collection":249,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":71,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":71,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[28856,36662,665,40470,28143,1169,3772,63232,61178,50247],"tags":[1,268435466,536870937,536874007,536874539,536875069,536877285,536879609,536880448,536883028,536883097],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[25,3095,3627,4157,6373,8697,9536,12116,12185],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1080777600000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1080777600000,"human":"2004-Apr-01","y":2004,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jdnym2bec1n9n99305zr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jdnym2bec1n9n99305zr","width":1200,"height":1532}}
