Instead, when you hit a special brick, it flips to show a letter. E.g. E (Extend bat), C (Catch ball), M (Missile), B (Bomb, explodes when hit by ball, clearing a number of bricks) and X (Extra life). \n \nThe enemies\/obstacles are more varied than in Arkanoid. Some make the bat freeze, some actually chew and eat your ball and spit out the core back at you!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[51485,36794,36608,34919,41647,16468,24199,22819,23175,18565],"tags":[1,268435489,536872673,536872924,536875071,1073741828],"developers":[3212],"publishers":[3212],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1761,2012,4159],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[69,15,26,25,27],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":69,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pw1e57b99brnft8ambg0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pw1e57b99brnft8ambg0","width":1000,"height":1053}}
