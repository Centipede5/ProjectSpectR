Specifically, the game is based on the 44 episode 1992-93 anime adaptation with the same name, and features most of its cast of characters in the roster. The game includes two modes: a single-player elimination tournament against increasingly difficult computer opponents, and a versus mode for up to two players. \n \nIn the single-player mode, the player can only choose from two characters: Phoenix and Tiki. The two characters fight almost identically. They fight through the other six characters from the versus mode and a \"clone fight\" against the character they did not select. Beating the game leads to the ending and a password (A, B, L, R, X, Y, Start) that allows players to select the same character as their opponent in versus mode.","collection":3759,"popularity":1,"games":[56987,70861,23113,14763,19658,76428,2558,62743,1235,41828],"tags":[268435460,536870926,536870990,536871019,536873299],"category":0,"keywords":[14,78,107,2387],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":728265600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":728265600000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Jan-29","y":1993,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":730944000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Mar-01","y":1993,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xl2is3zowroxbabf9zsi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xl2is3zowroxbabf9zsi","width":190,"height":342}}
