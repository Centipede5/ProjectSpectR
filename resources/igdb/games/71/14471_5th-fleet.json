You will have at your command a wide range of ships and aircrafts, with over 160 different units like Nimitz class carriers, Ticonderoga class cruisers and F-117A Stealth Fighter. Only ten scenarios are included in the game, but each one will probably require you several tries before you can complete it. There are indications in the manual for the time necessary to finish a scenario, given in number of turns and also expressed in hours, and sometimes even in days, knowing that a turn is equal to eight hours of real time. The game can be played by two players on the same computer or through electronic mail, or one against the computer.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":760060800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g4udfqaveip2g94l48tc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g4udfqaveip2g94l48tc","width":800,"height":946}}
