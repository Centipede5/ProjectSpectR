It is a sequel to Williams' 1982 game Joust. Like its predecessor, Joust 2 is a platform game that features two-dimensional (2D) graphics. The player uses a button and joystick to control a knight riding a flying ostrich. The object is to progress through levels by defeating groups of enemy knights riding buzzards. Joust 2 features improved audio-visuals and gameplay elements absent from the original. \n \nThe game uses more advanced hardware than the original Joust, allowing for the new elements. John Newcomer led development again, which began to create a conversion kit that allowed arcade owners to convert the cabinet into another game. Williams chose a vertically oriented screen for the kit as a result of the design's popularity at the time. Released during the waning days of the golden age of arcade games, Joust 2 did not achieve the success that Joust reached. The game was later released on home consoles as part of arcade compilations.","collection":3704,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,10039,1188,51485,26848,36608,74863,34919,27239],"tags":[1,268435464,536879683,536880070],"category":0,"keywords":[8771,9158],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":536457600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":536457600000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Jan-01","y":1987,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/im61uk6v9jlhbbrkbiwc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"im61uk6v9jlhbbrkbiwc","width":850,"height":1104}}
