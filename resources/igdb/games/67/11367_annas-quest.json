{"id":11367,"name":"Anna's Quest","slug":"annas-quest","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/annas-quest","created_at":1438000871979,"updated_at":1545340145212,"summary":"Dragons, witches, trolls... No one can stop Anna. With her telekinesis, unorthodox use of torture instruments, a knack for improvisation and the help of a shady fox she just makes her way. She communes with the dead, shuts off the local taverns beer supply and gets old ladies behind bars...\n\nThe world of author Dane Krams' debut on the game development stage isn't as cuddly as it may seem. Anna however, is actually perfectly nice - or is she? It all starts with freeing talking teddy bear... Anna's Quest unfolds a hand-drawn, grim tale with a good dash of self-irony.","storyline":"In a land far, far away lives a brave young girl called Anna. She lives a peaceful life in the forest with her grandfather, until a mysterious illness befalls him. And so Anna ventures forth to find a cure for him, but this world is a much more dangerous and bizarre place than she'd thought: putting her journey to a sudden end, the witch Winfriede kidnaps Anna to use her for an experiment.\n \nWinfriede's experiment is a success \u2013 Anna develops telekinetic powers, but this is also where the witch\u2019s schemes are foiled:  with the help of Ben, a boy who has been turned into a teddy bear, and new powers she can barely control, Anna manages to escape from her cell.\n \nTogether with Ben and her new impressive ability Anna is off for an adventure in the haunting world of Grimm's fairy-tales and European folklore. Witches, ghosts, trolls and cursed princesses: no matter if you have to save them or outsmart them \u2013 they all play their part in Anna's quest to find a cure for her grandfather.\n \nAnd since there's no rest for the wicked, Winfriede breathes down Anna's neck, eager to reclaim her successful experiment at any cost.","rating":80,"popularity":19.66666666666667,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":4,"games":[26223,24426,25222,31235,80916,47823,27266,18011,21641,236],"tags":[17,27,268435465,268435487,268435488,536871208,536873787,1073741828],"developers":[9215,2248],"publishers":[2248],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,2875],"themes":[17,27],"genres":[9,31,32],"first_release_date":1435795200000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1435795200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jul-02","y":2015,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1435795200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jul-02","y":2015,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m1zrfvlgp7cze8jrjyjf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m1zrfvlgp7cze8jrjyjf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lxbs7h1tw50l8bmow8uo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lxbs7h1tw50l8bmow8uo","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ny18rsrmmjep31leyo52.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ny18rsrmmjep31leyo52","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nuz8zwbzh59rcex3hwmh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nuz8zwbzh59rcex3hwmh","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hirqdteuk8hta7bgegvv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hirqdteuk8hta7bgegvv","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"6aZJveZUaBM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hyrdq9esz4o6izv3vura.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hyrdq9esz4o6izv3vura","width":391,"height":550},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards fantasy characters - Pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children - Violence that is not shown but is implied","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/327220"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.daedalic.de\/de\/game\/Annas_Quest"}],"external":{"steam":"327220"}}
