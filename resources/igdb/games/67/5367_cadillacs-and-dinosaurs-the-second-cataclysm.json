Once it could come out again, it found the world terribly changed, with dinosaurs roaming freely once again. A mysterious mutant-like race, called the Grith, believe the cataclysm was caused by the upsetting of the natural balance. Now, the leader of the restored City in the Sea, Scharnhorst, is using old technology and disrupting the balance again. The Girth chose you, Jack Tenrec, and your partner Hannah Dundee, to rid the world of Scharnhorst. And you get to do it in a red '53 Cadillac with mounted machine guns. \n \nWhile you're at the task, you must battle hungry, mean dinosaurs, but also be careful not to upset the balance of nature. Also, try not to upset your volcanic-energy fueled caddy by hitting too much obstacles along the way.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,10039,76246,19341,68287,68142,32902,28751,36950,54639],"tags":[1,268435461,536870918,536870999,536875590,536875655,536877996],"developers":[569],"publishers":[112,703],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[6,87,4678,4743,7084],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":770428800000,"platforms":[6,78],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":78,"date":770428800000,"human":"1994-Jun","y":1994,"m":6},{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":770428800000,"human":"1994-Jun","y":1994,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fdicjwhit4qkuso7hva5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fdicjwhit4qkuso7hva5","width":220,"height":374},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
