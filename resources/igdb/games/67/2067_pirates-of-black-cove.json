From a top-down perspective, players use swords, muskets, and cannon balls to defeat other pirates and enemy soldiers. These land and sea battles are accompanied by gunfire, sword-clanging sounds, and explosions; enemies cry out when hit and collapse to the ground when killed. In battle, players can use bottles of grog to restore characters' health; a variety of sequences contain other references to alcohol (e.g., \u201cI'm laughing so hard I nearly spilled me rum,\u201d\u201cThe ramblings of drunken sailors . . .\u201d and \u201cWhere do pirates drink their beer?\u201d). In one scene, a couple of characters allude to marijuana plants: \u201cI trap here, mon. Got too much bad weed\u201d\/\u201cHeh, I thought you meant the other kind of weed.\u201d During the course of the game, players can uncover hidden jokes\u2014some of which contain questions\/answers that are sexual in nature (e.g., Q: \u201cHow does a pirate greet a prostitute?\u201d Q: \u201cWhat's a horny pirate's worst nightmare?\u201d A: \u201cA sunken chest with no booty,\u201d Q: \u201cHow does a pirate tell his wench he wants to have sex?\u201d). The words \u201ca*s\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence towards non human looking characters - Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.blackcovegame.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/49330"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pirates_of_Black_Cove"}],"external":{"steam":"49330"}}
