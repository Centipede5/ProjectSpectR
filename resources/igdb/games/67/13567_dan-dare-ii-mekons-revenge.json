He\u2019s created the SuperTreens, a genetically engineered species bent on destruction, as well as a new spaceship. As Dan Dare, you must stop him. \n \nYou have gained access to Mekon\u2019s spaceship, which is packed with SuperTreens. When you find each one you must disable each control box before the time limit, and then reach the next level. Mekon will be trying to reach and activate each one, with the help of his existing race of Treens. Although Dan has six lives, being caught in an blast triggered by the destruction of a level without appropriate shielding is Game Over. Extra lives are scored incrementally after 50,000 points, while energy recharges can be obtained around the game.","collection":1711,"franchise":617,"franchises":[617],"popularity":2,"games":[28029,68287,36950,76246,64204,76722,19341,10039,27314,25311],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536873303,536875222,1073741828],"developers":[12658],"publishers":[8108],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2391,4310],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Dan Dare II: Mekon's Revenge","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qm5lfyvzc2po43umziga.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qm5lfyvzc2po43umziga","width":1811,"height":2344}}
