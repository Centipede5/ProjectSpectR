{"id":41167,"name":"Mollusk Redux","slug":"mollusk-redux","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/mollusk-redux","created_at":1498813471369,"updated_at":1500262927140,"summary":"Dive into the ocean and guide the mollusk through 24 levels of excitement in this C64 exclusive underwater eat 'em up! \n \nOriginally entered in RGCD's 16KB Cartridge Game Development Competition (2011), this special redux version features a number of enhancements over the competition release, including: \n \n* 4 stages each with 6 levels, \n* A limited amount of fishes to eat on each level. \n* Bonus fish, \n* Improved controls, \n* Hi-score table, \n* Optional disk hi-score saver\/loader (and hi-score reset), \n* Game map wraps horizontally, \n* PAL\/NTSC compatibility, \n* Other minor bugfixes. \n \nThe game is set across four oceans (Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Antarctic) each made up of six levels. The goal on each level is to eat a set quota of fish whilst avoiding enemy eels, piranhas, sharks and falling anchors. Your mollusk isn't defenseless though - you have a reserve of ink at your disposal! \n \nThe fish stock of each ocean is rapidly depleting - much like in real life - so you'll have to move quick. The stock level reduces when fish leave the screen, so try not to let too many get past you as you zoom about the ocean! When the stock runs out, you'll lose a life. \n \nThe simple HUD on the bottom of the screen functions using both characters and colours. Ink is represented by eight little droplets. These deplete with use and can be recharged by eating jellyfish. Standard ink (grey on the HUD) scares enemies or other fish away and is obtained by eating white jellyfish, whereas poisonous ink (red on the HUD) kills enemies. When you have a reserve of poisonous ink left, any additional ink obtained will also become poisonous. Note that kills achieved using poisonous ink are added towards your fish quota. \n \nYour Mollusk can take two hits from eels or anchors, after which point the lives counter on the HUD will flash red. Another hit will cost you a life, and note that blue eels also slow the Mollusk down. Sharks and piranhas are deadly to touch. \n \nThe fish stock level flashes red and an audible alarm sounds when there are 20 or less fish left in the ocean.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1296518400000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":1296518400000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Feb-01","y":2011,"m":2}]}
