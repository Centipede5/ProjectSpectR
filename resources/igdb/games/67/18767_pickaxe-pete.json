{"id":18767,"name":"Pickaxe Pete","slug":"pickaxe-pete","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/pickaxe-pete","created_at":1460681154889,"updated_at":1517270861028,"summary":"You play a miner named Pickaxe Pete, and you start off in the middle of the screen with a pick-axe. There are three doors from which boulders are coming, bouncing down the mine-shafts; every time Pete destroys one of these he gains 3 points, although the axe wears out after a while and disappears. When two boulders collide, they explode, and out comes either a pick-axe which floats to the bottom of the screen, a key which floats to the top, or nothing. If Pete has no axe, you can either jump over boulders (gaining him 1 point), or get to the bottom of the mine to retrieve a new axe (gaining a 5-point bonus). If he collects a key then he can enter the doors, which lead him to the next level.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,51485,24199,1073,10039,1188,42611,36794,67197,36608],"tags":[1,268435464,268435489,1073741828],"publishers":[9542],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[133],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":133,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pick Axe Pete!"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"EFy876HAV4Q"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/os0o4r9bh0dnms0a2skh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"os0o4r9bh0dnms0a2skh","width":1000,"height":1315}}
