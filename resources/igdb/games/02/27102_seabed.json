To separate truth from illusion. To make sense of their own lives.\"","storyline":"I saw a ghost in the living room. \nBut as I was already used to the phenomenon, I did not let it interfere with the preparation of my evening meal. \nThe ghost ate my fried egg and commended its taste. \nAs I listened to her talk, my memories drifted back to the days we were still together. \nBack when we were in school, she asked me what was necessary for the two of us to be together. \nA small workplace that we could make a living from without relying on anyone. \nA silent apartment where we would have the freedom to do what our hearts desired. \nI told her that. \n \nIn the late eighties \u2013 during the economic boom \u2013 the small design company we founded was doing surprisingly well. \nWe visited all the places we talked about when we were in school \u2013 the southern islands, the old European cities, the West Coast. We went wherever we wanted, seeing whatever we sought. \nAlone in that spacious living room, I attempted to figure out why it all ended this way. Why those days when nothing could stand in our way faded into the past. \nI no longer felt like I could do everything. \nThe world had grown complicated. Even simple matters became difficult. \nThe rules we had established in the past no longer seemed to apply, and the castle we built for ourselves crumbled to dust. \n\"What is necessary for us to be together?\" \u2013 the ghost asked me. \nWe need a make a new place for ourselves. \nA place no one can destroy. \nLet's make it a place that no one else can reach. \nAnd so, I inconspicuously proceeded with the plan. \nIn a place so deep below the surface that no one else can find it.","collection":39,"rating":70,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":65,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":0,"games":[27301,76397,28465,51991,103232,41895,26163,75797,34053,43130],"tags":[42,43,268435487,268435488,536871006,536871208,536871938,536872873,536874223,536874498,536875045,1073741829],"developers":[12054],"publishers":[12054,6083],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[94,296,1026,1961,3311,3586,4133],"themes":[42,43],"genres":[31,32],"first_release_date":1453680000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1513728000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Dec-20","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1453680000000,"region":5,"human":"2016-Jan-25","y":2016,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30b7\u30fc\u30d9\u30c3\u30c9","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/shvgqw4hiezmedsqi26a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"shvgqw4hiezmedsqi26a","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dkplpbojaklq829m47nk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dkplpbojaklq829m47nk","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lpcjrqjj2yhs5qkwdmek.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lpcjrqjj2yhs5qkwdmek","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f7vbfotpppnritiihar4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f7vbfotpppnritiihar4","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xxyxvt2xeosuqhf7can7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xxyxvt2xeosuqhf7can7","width":1440,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"C1zYBU5AEnA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/itipmnwbwk2goyhhq6lp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"itipmnwbwk2goyhhq6lp","width":700,"height":756},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/583090"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/fruitbatfactory.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"583090"}}
