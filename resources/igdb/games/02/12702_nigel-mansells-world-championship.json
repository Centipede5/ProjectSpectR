The game was pitched somewhere in between a full-blown simulation like F1 GP and action games like Continental Circus. Only 12 cars were in each race, which could last from between 3 and 20 laps. \n \nBefore each race you can customize wing downforce, gear ratio, tyre selection and fuel load choices \u2013 pitstops are a standard feature of the longer races. The 16-bit versions include a unique 'Improve With Mansell' mode, in which a digitized version of Nigel's head appears in the top corner of the screen, offering instructions and praise.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[27378,76566,55192,3772,19462,40470,44178,5597,69725,7747],"tags":[268435466,268435470,536871532,536872852,536874337,536875069,536875117,536875128,536875955,536876348,536876749,1073741825],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[620,1940,3425,4157,4205,4216,5043,5436,5837],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[29,114,13,16,19,18],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":18,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":19,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":29,"human":"TBD"}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Nigel Mansell F-1 Challenge","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dvizt0kte2erddi3hdru.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvizt0kte2erddi3hdru","width":640,"height":817}}
