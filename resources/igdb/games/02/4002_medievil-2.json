{"id":4002,"name":"MediEvil 2","slug":"medievil-2","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/medievil-2","created_at":1390370468982,"updated_at":1543543919884,"summary":"MediEvil 2 or MediEvil II in its NA release, sequel to the popular MediEvil takes place after the noble but bony Sir Dan Fortesque defeats the evil wizard Zarok. After a new villain by the name of Lord Palethorn arises, poor Dan is awakened along with everything dead and forgotten. The game allows you to explore past levels as well as collecting the Chalice which gives a new weapon once 100% of the souls have been returned in the level. The game has many comedic moments, such as when Sir Dan tries conversing with a bunch of midgets in the city sewers who think he is an almighty God.","storyline":"In Kensington in the year 1886, 500 years after Sir Daniel Fortesque's battle against the evil sorcerer Zarok, a sorcerer named Lord Palethorn discovers Zarok's spellbook and casts its spell of raising the dead over the city of London. However, the pages of the book soon scatter across London and Palethorn gains a demonlike appearance as a result. The spell Palethorn casts once again brings Sir Dan, who was resting at a nearby museum, back to life. He is recruited by a professor named Hamilton Kift and his ghostly sidekick Winston to recover the pages of Zarok's spellbook and put a stop to Palethorn's plans. Along the way, they end up being joined by an ancient mummy princess named Kiya, who becomes Dan's love interest. \n \nDuring an incident in which Kiya goes off on her own, she is killed by Jack the Ripper, much to the shock of Dan. Discovering a time machine, Dan travels back in time in order to save Kiya, merging with his past self to gain golden armour. As Dan finally confronts Palethorn, he steals the pages from him and uses it to summon a large blue demon. However, Dan manages to turn the demon against Palethorn, putting a stop to both of them. As Palethorn blows up his lair on his dying breath, Dan decides to join Kiya together in the afterlife as they return to their eternal rest. If the player has collected all the Chalices, Dan and Kiya will instead go for a ride on the time machine, which takes them to Zarok's arena.","collection":653,"rating":80.9450359522596,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":80.9450359522596,"total_rating_count":23,"rating_count":23,"games":[56033,24426,20342,2933,19150,33269,51524,19561,10760,19001],"tags":[1,19,27,268435464,268435481,268435487,536871041,536871138,536871208,536871262,536871301,536871818,536871878,536871939,536872032,536872201,536872961,536874398,536874745,536875073,536875131,536875262,536875271,536875396,536875485,536875572,536875573,536875609,536875639,536875760,536875825,536876032,536876706,536876876,536877406,536878323,536879761,536880441,536880959,536881414,536884863,1073741826],"developers":[749],"publishers":[334],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[129,226,296,350,389,906,966,1027,1120,1289,2049,3486,3833,4161,4219,4350,4359,4484,4573,4660,4661,4697,4727,4848,4913,5120,5794,5964,6494,7411,8849,9529,10047,10502,13951],"themes":[1,19,27],"genres":[8,25,31],"first_release_date":956102400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":957052800000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Apr-30","y":2000,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":956102400000,"region":1,"human":"2000-Apr-19","y":2000,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MediEvil 2","comment":"Other"},{"name":"MediEvil II","comment":"NA Release"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bxz4daf8fwu7xnefzdru.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bxz4daf8fwu7xnefzdru","width":440,"height":350},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l9jhisk092gujxmfpcrk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l9jhisk092gujxmfpcrk","width":440,"height":350},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oodwdfmq2l1jdbblylwm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oodwdfmq2l1jdbblylwm","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yhmilgy23rhhzhmd5oi4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yhmilgy23rhhzhmd5oi4","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/icplrvkomsntp6ajlnff.jpg","cloudinary_id":"icplrvkomsntp6ajlnff","width":640,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"6BBTzQNF07A"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"rylerJgR4WY"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"S2NiH53U6Ac"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xfxk7h6wfnlncpme4vsh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xfxk7h6wfnlncpme4vsh","width":543,"height":640},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/MediEvil_2"}]}
