Treasure Planet brings Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island not just right up-to-date but into the future--one in which the spaceship Legacy is overrun by mutinous pirates, led by the cyborg John Silver. You'll take on the role of Jim as he solar-surfs and performs action moves with the help of Morph, who can transform into various items. Embark on a voyage through 10 levels, minigames, and boss challenges as you view original artwork, behind-the-scenes game footage, and stored movie clips.","collection":2986,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23175,59516,13189,27314,55289,25222,25646,26914,25311,22425],"tags":[1,268435487,536871939,536872552,536875054,536875294,536875699,536880441],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1027,1471,1640,4142,4345,4382,4787,6059,9529],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[11,15,31],"first_release_date":1038700800000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1038700800000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Dec-01","y":2002,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lqaxiqc9j6tshvosxdnp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lqaxiqc9j6tshvosxdnp","width":1530,"height":1370},"esrb":{"rating":4}}
