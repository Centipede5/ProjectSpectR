Experience the adventures of Keiji Maeda from personal conflicts with his adopted Maeda family, brave combat exploits, travels to the capital, and relationships with famous existing figures such as Iyeyasu Tokugawa, Rikyuu the tea master, and Hideyoshi himself, to experiences with the foreign and Japanese Christian faithful.","popularity":1,"games":[37088,19289,36911,11423,13189,7364,22425,36792,26163,25222],"tags":[17,22,268435460,268435487,536870973,536871019,536871165,536871213,536871939,536874398,536875054,536875067,536875073,536875090,536875198,536875222,536875406,536875870,536877696,536878439],"category":0,"keywords":[61,107,253,301,1027,3486,4142,4155,4161,4178,4286,4310,4494,4958,6784,7527],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[4,31],"first_release_date":787708800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":787708800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Dec-18","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dvpnjsjtuwlbdxe0kn4u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvpnjsjtuwlbdxe0kn4u","width":280,"height":499}}
