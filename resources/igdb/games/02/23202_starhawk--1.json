Starhawk is a shoot 'em up with a fixed environment. The game was unique at the time as it presented the graphics in a pseudo-three dimensional way. Essentially, the game is a simple video game version of the Star Wars: Episode IV trench run. The game was later ported to the Vectrex video game console in 1982. The game is remembered as having quite advanced graphics for the time and being the first video game based upon or to have noticeable references to Star Wars.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,142,71455,25300,27523,11253],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871859,536871882,536871937,536873064,536873246,536880437,1073741825],"developers":[1139],"publishers":[1139,9539],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[947,970,1025,2152,2334,9525],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":315446400000,"platforms":[70,52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":315446400000,"region":2,"human":"1979","y":1979,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":70,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aplxc89qywixpbire3rp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aplxc89qywixpbire3rp","width":1000,"height":1365}}
