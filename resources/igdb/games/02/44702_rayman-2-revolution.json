Now in full 3D and blending humor, suspense, and blinding speed, Rayman must escape an intergalactic zoo by using the powers of his still-imprisoned friends to open the door to an even greater power to free them. Unique to the PS2 version of the game are a number of brand new stages, a harder difficulty level, and a progressive upgrade system that gives Rayman a number of abilities not found in other iterations.","popularity":1,"games":[29032,37419,33269,27880,81249,80916,1070,78149,24426,19150],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,536873712,536893605,536893606],"category":0,"keywords":[2800,22693,22694],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":983577600000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":983577600000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Mar-03","y":2001,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tfzh1hqomosmjoqa2mzo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tfzh1hqomosmjoqa2mzo","width":1273,"height":601}]}
