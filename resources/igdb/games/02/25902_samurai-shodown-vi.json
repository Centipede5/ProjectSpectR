{"id":25902,"name":"Samurai Shodown VI","slug":"samurai-shodown-vi","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/samurai-shodown-vi","created_at":1479683537704,"updated_at":1537843110963,"summary":"Among other series changes, aerial blocking was removed entirely, and the switch-around move, which enabled a player to shift quickly behind the other's back, as well as the dodge (evade, side-step), in which the move virtually brings a semi-3D environment to the defense in attempt to use each sword more effectively. \n \nOne can no longer charge one's own \"pow\" gauge. The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The \"CD combo\" was added, wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps. \n \nSNK also added a \"suicide\" move, wherein one's character forfeits the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full \"POW\" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a \"fatality\" move in the vein of Mortal Kombat.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[2254,42044,103269,75964,75962,42584,106859,106777,103848,99742],"tags":[268435460],"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":848880000000,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":848880000000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Nov-25","y":1996,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y59ugziq9iilk5vxa12u.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y59ugziq9iilk5vxa12u","width":1450,"height":1892}}
