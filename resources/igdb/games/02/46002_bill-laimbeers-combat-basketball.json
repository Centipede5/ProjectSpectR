Basketball teams play in gruelling league matches where new players are bought and sold. Within this future, basketball uses a dedicated robot to perform the toss up at the start of each match as referees had been fired by Bill Laimbeer sometime prior to the year 2030. As a result, players now wear armor to their games and weapons are thrown from the audience.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":691545600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":691545600000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Dec-01","y":1991,"m":12}]}
