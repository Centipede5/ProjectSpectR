Characters are able to move left, right, up, down... jump and drop. \n \nThough you can record your animations and play them back, there is no method of saving your work, so it all disappears when the power goes off.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44242,24491,28465,75579,75275,34919,75102,33603,36962,55888],"tags":[268435469],"category":0,"genres":[13],"first_release_date":454896000000,"platforms":[68],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":68,"date":454896000000,"region":8,"human":"1984-Jun-01","y":1984,"m":6}]}
