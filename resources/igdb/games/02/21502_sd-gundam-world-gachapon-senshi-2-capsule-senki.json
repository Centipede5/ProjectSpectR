As with its predecessor, Scramble Wars, the game is a tactical turn-based war simulation in which each side uses their Gundam mechas to defeat the other and are occasionally aided by a \"gachapon\" - or capsule machine - that dispenses additional Gundams in a manner similar to their toy counterparts. \n \nThe game was the first of the series to be released on a Famicom cart, as Scramble Wars was a Famicom Disk System-only game. Capsule Senki was also rereleased on the Japanese Wii Shop's Virtual Console.","collection":3603,"franchise":820,"franchises":[820],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[51464,25311,68287,76731,19301,11582,25300,71455,36950,19099],"tags":[1,18,268435471,536870990,536871079,536871882,536874694,536875053,536875054,536875290,536875434,536880702,1073741826],"developers":[10071,1744],"publishers":[1215,617,10436,6330],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,167,970,3782,4141,4142,4378,4522,9790],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":614563200000,"platforms":[47,18,27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":614563200000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Jun-23","y":1989,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":643593600000,"region":5,"human":"1990-May-25","y":1990,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":47,"date":1297728000000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Feb-15","y":2011,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/byuekvv5byeszsuyhiq4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"byuekvv5byeszsuyhiq4","width":297,"height":205}}
