Well, they went and made one anyway. this is one of those brain melting puzzle games that some will love and some will despise. Each level you are presented with a room with boxes and spots, which are where the boxes should end up. You can push the boxes, but not pull them and you really have to plan in advance to stop getting, um...'boxed' in. If you feel you've taken a bit of a wrong turn, you can simply push a button and rewind your moves. But as well as countless levels of box-shoving there's also a level editor that allows you to create your own levels of fun and frustration. \n \n(From The PC Engine Software Bible)","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":640224000000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":640224000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Apr-16","y":1990,"m":4}]}
