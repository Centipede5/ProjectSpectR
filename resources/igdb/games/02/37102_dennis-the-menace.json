{"id":37102,"name":"Dennis the Menace","slug":"dennis-the-menace","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/dennis-the-menace","created_at":1497357804779,"updated_at":1540409555470,"summary":"This game brings the US cartoon character Dennis the Menace's menacing treatment of poor old Mr. Wilson to the computer screen, around the time of the film also released in 1993. \n \nDennis is a platform game across settings such as Sewers, the Park, and Mr. Wilson\u2019s house, each of which has an end-of-level bad guy. The in-level opposition follows standard attack patterns and can usually be avoided. The enemies regenerate as you move on, although you generally only progress from bottom-left to top-right anyway. \n \nSome of the holes in the ground are deadly while others lead to secret rooms. Fortunately, you are given up to 9 lives at the start, and lots of extra lives are on offer throughout the game, so these are well worth checking out. A choice between music and sound effects is offered.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[20342,103339,3766,61548,19001,43465,33269,24426,51464,19150],"tags":[27,268435464,536871213,536871262,536872961,536873064,536875054,536875073,536875125,536875209,536875294,536875637,536875736,536877314],"category":0,"keywords":[301,350,2049,2152,4142,4161,4213,4297,4382,4725,4824,6402],"themes":[27],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":16,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Dennis","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/usd0megvsyhsp7nbvqgd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"usd0megvsyhsp7nbvqgd","width":2100,"height":1534}}
