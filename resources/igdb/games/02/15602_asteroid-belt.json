In Asteroid Belt you are flying - guess what - through an asteroid belt. Typical for Atari is the lack of and ending, so you\u00b4re shooting asteroids for points. You can fly and also shoot in four different directions and even control your speed. Sometimes there is a giant UFO trying to catch and kill you, so the fast speed is comming in handy, although you have to avoid the asteroids and flee from the giant UFO. \n \nThis is one of the few non-popular Atari games amongst the universe of Atari Space-games that is really good.","popularity":1,"games":[68287,14364,28029,36950,142,64204,27314,71455,27523,10209],"tags":[18,268435461,536871882,536871937],"category":0,"keywords":[970,1025],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jqw7me0ffbwvekn7vw2b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jqw7me0ffbwvekn7vw2b","width":400,"height":481}}
