Everyone expected the league leaders to roll into town and easily defeat the home team. But the scrappy upstarts have played the game of their lives and managed to keep the score tied right until the end. Their fatigue is showing and now it's their last chance. If the home team batters don\u2019t score a run now, the visitors will be sure to win the game in extra innings. It all comes down to the Bottom of the 9th! \n \nWill you lead the underdogs to victory? Or will you defend the league leaders\u2019 unbroken winning streak? \n \nBottom of the 9th is a strategic 2-player baseball game played with cards and dice. This faithful adaptation brings the fast-paced fun of the tabletop game to your phone and tablet! Choose your lineup from a pool of players with different strengths and abilities, outsmart your opponent in the stare-down, then roll the dice to trigger the action. \n \nBottom of the 9th offers many ways to play: \n\u2022 Compete in single player against a computer opponent (3 levels of difficulty) \n\u2022 Take on the Manager's Challenge 6-game solo campaign mode \n\u2022 Pass and play on your device with a friend \n\u2022 Challenge a friend to play online \n\u2022 Find a worthy opponent in a ranked online match \n\u2022 Organize a casual online exhibition game \n \nThe powerhouse visitors have 6 dynamite pitchers to choose from, including: \n\u2022 Wake Louder throws a nasty knuckleball that can get a lost ball just into the edge of the strike zone. \n\u2022 Southpaw Straw is a talented lefty pitcher with one dangerously effective (and illegal) spitball. \n\u2022 Hurricane Patriss is a top notch reliever, and the only thing more hypnotic than his curveball is his voice. \n \nDon't count out the home team! They have a dozen batters, each with their own special powers, including: \n\u2022 Mully Nomah can be devastating against the pitching team when runners are in scoring position. He can clobber a pitch and get those base runners home! \n\u2022 Kerry Rumble has power behind her swing. She has the ability to crush the ball hard, at the cost of hitting lots of fouls. She just can\u2019t resist taking a swing! \n\u2022 K.C. Petty is truly a powerhouse when the chips are down. The more strikes he gets, the bigger he swings. \n\u2022 Hannah Cait may look innocent, but when she's in the zone she calls all the shots! This rookie's level of control over her swing is the envy of many a veteran. \n \nBoth teams have access to 2 support characters who provide special abilities to one or both teams: \n\u2022 Dice Dixon has no problem taking chances coming out from the dugout, benching batters and challenging umps! \n\u2022 Doc Mullins is always looking after the health of the team, whether that means a more rested pitcher or more energized batters! \n \nThe Manager's Challenge solo campaign mode puts you right in the dugout as a team manager.
