There is a small unshielded exhaust port which you must hit directly with a torpedo. As you approach the death star numerous imperial fighters and Darth Vader himself will try to stop you. Your fighter is equipped with lasers to fight the imperial fighters and Darth Vader, and three torpedoes to use against the death star. The mission fails if you miss the death star with all three torpedoes or are destroyed by a fighter.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,25311,71455,36794,36608,51485,34919,36950,76722],"tags":[1,18,268435489],"publishers":[11349],"category":0,"themes":[1,18],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":410140800000,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yd2pzgtn2ylq4hhaz0ub.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yd2pzgtn2ylq4hhaz0ub","width":640,"height":400}}
