The only land parts of the level are at the entrance to the Titanic, which is sunk by the iceberg. \n \nOther changes include fewer bonus levels and fewer quotes, due to the Nintendo 64 cartridges storing significantly less data for games than CDs. Some of the sound effects were altered slightly.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":907200000000,"platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":907200000000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Oct-01","y":1998,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wu8bijxrqd5h9ovymd9k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wu8bijxrqd5h9ovymd9k","width":2100,"height":1532}}
