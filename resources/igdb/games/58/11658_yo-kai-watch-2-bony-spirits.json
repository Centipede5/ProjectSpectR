Players navigate around the open world using the Nintendo 3DS' touchscreen to find and befriend various Yo-kai, which are scattered across the overworld. Players befriend Yo-kai by giving them a food that they like before beginning battle, and after defeating the Yo-kai it approaches the player character and gives them its Yo-kai Medal, allowing it to be summoned at will. A new feature in battles is using the touch screen to find a particular sweetspot on an enemy Yo-kai to increase the likelihood of befriending it at the end of the battle, or other sweetspots for extra damage, extra money, or extra experience. Yo-kai can also be acquired through an in game Crank-a-kai (Gasha Machine) by collecting in-game coins or using Play Coins. Certain Yo-kai are necessary for completing the game's main quest, and special rare Yo-kai are acquired through various subquests. Yo-kai have the capability to evolve into more powerful versions of themselves if they reach a certain level, or they can evolve by combining with particular items or other Yo-kai. The Yo-kai are divided amongst eight different classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. There are also Legendary Yo-kai that can only be obtained by collecting a particular set of Yo-kai listed in the Yo-kai Medallium, a compendium of the different Yo-kai the player has encountered or befriended. When the player encounters a Yo-kai, he enters into battle with it using six Yo-kai that the player has befriended previously. The touchscreen is used during battles to rotate amongst the player's Yo-kai in battle at will. It is also used either to clear up status effects on the player's Yo-kai or to charge up the Yo-kai's Soultimate abilities. While the original Yo-kai Watch featured nearly 250 Yo-kai, Yo-Kai Watch 2 features nearly 450, including several that were featured as bosses in the original game.","franchise":961,"franchises":[961],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":66.875,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":66.875,"total_rating_count":8,"games":[81249,25877,54775,109581,75848,28010,103282,26658,25076,57372],"tags":[1,17,19,27,35,38,268435468,536870990,536871262,536872032,536872256,536872594,536872822,536872983,536873311,536873476,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[837],"publishers":[2850,837],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[78,350,1120,1344,1682,1910,2071,2399,2564],"themes":[1,17,19,27,35,38],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1404950400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1475193600000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Sep-30","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1491523200000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Apr-07","y":2017,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1404950400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Jul-10","y":2014,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Y\u014dkai Watch 2: Ganzo","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"\u5996\u602a\u30a6\u30a9\u30c3\u30c12 \u5143\u7956","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iwiukujxwekcnefzlo4b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iwiukujxwekcnefzlo4b","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"yzsQVuGjUaA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l2ucjab2vebxhzxgl06t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l2ucjab2vebxhzxgl06t","width":482,"height":430},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a role-playing game in which players help a young boy regain his lost memories. As players traverse around a city, they can identify and interact with ghost-like creatures (Yo-Kai) and use them in turn-based combat against other creatures. Yo-Kai can use various attacks (e.g., punches, sword slashes, magic spells) to drain opponents' life meters; colorful light effects, smacking\/zapping sounds, and depleting hit points indicate damage during battles. A handful of sequences also depict violent acts: a cat hit by a truck; a child beaten up by bullies. The game includes several depictions and references to bodily functions: a Yo-Kai called Snotsolong with mucous dripping from its nose; Yo-Kai (Cuttincheez and Cheeksqueek) with buttocks for heads that use flatulence-like attacks; dialogue that states, \u201cIt smells a little like my farts. . .\u201d and \u201cI mean, if it were my farts that had made this smoke. . .
