Some of the artists included are: Public Enemy, LL Cool J, Naughty By Nature, Queen Latifah (!), Yo-Yo, House of Pain, Onyx, Warren G. and Coolio. The gameplay is modeled after the fast-paced NBA Jam and takes place on various outdoor courts in 5 different U.S. cities. Up to four players can compete, and the \"Xtra\" button works similar to turbo. There's a shot meter that enables you to sink jumpers and rattle the rim. No 3-point shots exist and there are no fouls in the game.","popularity":1,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"keywords":[58,6460,8780,9577],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kqvfhvzrto6urglyy908.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kqvfhvzrto6urglyy908","width":620,"height":439}}
