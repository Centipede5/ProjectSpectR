It was published by Global Star Software, before GSS was absorbed into Take-Two Interactive (and what is now 2K Play). \n \nDespite poor reviews by most gaming websites and critics, the game was a commercial success. The Wii and DS versions of the game have combined shipped over 7 million copies to date,[1] which according to the NPD Group, is the third best-selling third-party game on the Wii. \n \nAs a result of the original's success, a follow-up for the Wii was announced, and launched in the fall of 2008, titled Carnival Games: Mini-Golf.[2] A proper sequel, New Carnival Games, was released on September 21, 2010 for the Wii and Nintendo DS.[3]","collection":2494,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":55,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[11588,28113,19083,18387,28213,35626,36868,19082,7782,76098],"tags":[27,40,268435470,536870942,536871262,536871596,536871597,536872475,536875123,536875350,536875626,536877275,536883988],"developers":[2000],"publishers":[2001],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[30,350,684,685,1563,4211,4438,4714,6363,13076],"themes":[27,40],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1224460800000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1224460800000,"human":"2008-Oct-20","y":2008,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gqokqamncjeon6mjmbhz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gqokqamncjeon6mjmbhz","width":170,"height":240},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
