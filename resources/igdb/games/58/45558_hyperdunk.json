The three modes of play are Exhibition, Multi-Play, and Playoff. In Playoff Mode, one team is selected and placed in a tournament bracket. The first round is a best-of-5 series while the remaining rounds are best-of-seven. Passwords are given during the semi-final round. \n \nEach player has a separate gauge that determines their energy level in addition to how effective that they are with their shots. Unlike the NBA or NCAA college basketball, the shot clock is shown in milliseconds in addition to seconds. Each player is shown with an identical height and weight to all the other players in-game. \n \nInstead of four teams like the original, players can choose to be one of the 16 teams which vaguely resemble teams from the National Basketball Association. The team name for each city corresponds to the culture of each venue.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,55715,40524,14713,23175,16468,1070,2940,68324],"tags":[1,268435470],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":765417600000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":765417600000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Apr-04","y":1994,"m":4}]}
