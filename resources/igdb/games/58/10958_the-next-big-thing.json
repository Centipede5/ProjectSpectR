Players solve puzzles, interact with various characters, and search for clues as they piece together the storyline. A handful of sequences depict mild acts of violence (e.g., a woman firing a tranquilizer gun, a character poisoning a man's pipe). The dialogue sometimes references suggestive material (e.g.,'Us skinny girls without so much up front are much more attractive'), and one sequence depicts a robot scanning the identity of a woman (e.g., 'Bust: 40DD, Waist: 20, Hips: 34'). One female character wears an outfit that exposes moderate amounts of cleavage. During the course of the game, characters can be seen holding smoking pipes and cigars; players can also view a handful of alcohol-related items (e.g., a margarita-making kit).","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Sexual images and\/or sexual innuendo - Mild bad language","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/58570"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Next_Big_Thing_%28video_game%29"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.thenextbig-game.com\/"}],"external":{"steam":"58570"}}
