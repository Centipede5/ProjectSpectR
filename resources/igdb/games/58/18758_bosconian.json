{"id":18758,"name":"Bosconian","slug":"bosconian","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/bosconian","created_at":1460648216860,"updated_at":1546425703801,"summary":"The object of Bosconian is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemy bases and ships. The player controls a small fighter ship that can move in eight directions and can fire both forward and backward. Each level consists of a number of green space stations that must all be destroyed to advance to the next level (a semi-transparent mini-map helps identify their location). Each station consists of six cannons arranged in a hexagon, surrounding a central core. The player must either destroy all six cannons or shoot the core to destroy a station, and in later levels the core is capable of defending itself. \nAdditionally, the player must avoid or destroy asteroids, mines, and a variety of enemy missiles and ships that attempt to collide with the player's ship. Enemies occasionally launch formation attacks \u2014 destroying the leader causes all remaining enemies to disperse, but destroying all enemies in a formation scores extra bonus points. A spy ship (worth a random bonus value) also appears occasionally, which must be destroyed or the enemies will go berserk.","collection":1758,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,55038,36950,27398,17130,28029,19249,14364,90099,109627],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871113,536871859,536871882,536871937,536871970,536872651,536875046,536875258,536875262,536875942,536877141,536878192,536878610,536880077,536885038,1073741827],"developers":[263],"publishers":[327,10317,2067,263],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[166,201,947,970,1025,1058,1739,4134,4346,4350,5030,6229,7280,7698,9165,14126],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":378604800000,"platforms":[52,121,77,47,27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":47,"date":1258416000000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Nov-17","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":121,"date":596937600000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Dec-01","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":77,"date":567907200000,"region":5,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":473299200000,"region":5,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":378604800000,"region":5,"human":"1981","y":1981,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Star Destroyer","comment":"Other"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"_nP5xKoObu4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nfxbsrdijsuzngrlq1bw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nfxbsrdijsuzngrlq1bw","width":1000,"height":410},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCSSSsJrhGifBoxoVqvVU1lQ"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Bosconian-197464100295571"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bosconian"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/namco.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bosconian"}]}
