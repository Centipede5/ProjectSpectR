Despite being the third game in the Nazo Puyo subseries, it is drastically different from its prequels, taking a combined RPG\/puzzle approach to its (now existent) storyline. It would receive two sequels, both on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super Nazo Puyo Rulue no Roux, combining a retooled version of this game with a new story mode focusing on Rulue, and Super Nazo Puyo Tsu: Rulue no Tetsuwan Hanjouki, a new game focusing exclusively on Rulue).","collection":3350,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19376,19934,29173,18167,25222,55036,18918,23345,55590,19301],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536873787,536874694,536875046,536875434,536879119],"category":0,"keywords":[2875,3782,4134,4522,8207],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":778118400000,"platforms":[35],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":778118400000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Aug-29","y":1994,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Nazo Puyo: Aruru no ruuu","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eptln8omnvncwj51y4xp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eptln8omnvncwj51y4xp","width":315,"height":380}}
