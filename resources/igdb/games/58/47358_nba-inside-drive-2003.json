One of the most important aspects of professional basketball is being able to drive to the lane and have a player make it look like he's going up for a shot so that he can draw defense, but then pass the ball to an open man on the inside or to a wide-open player out on the perimeter. Indeed, generally driving through the lane can be a little problematic since the AI tends to latch onto players in the paint, and the juke moves can be difficult to use effectively against tough opponents.","collection":4959,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23446,22425,24124,4031,8832,3549,26772,54662,811,71666],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536870970,536872060,536872078,536872352,536875073,536875138,536875186,536875257,536875265,536875271,536875525,536875562,536875615,536875659,536875749,536875870,536875941,536877459,536877463,536881357,536884029],"category":0,"keywords":[58,1148,1166,1440,4161,4226,4274,4345,4353,4359,4613,4650,4703,4747,4837,4958,5029,6547,6551,10445,13117],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":1038700800000,"platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1038700800000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Dec-01","y":2002,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b1wnlomgosvvn1eyuswi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b1wnlomgosvvn1eyuswi","width":1533,"height":2171},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
