{"id":9758,"name":"Luckless Seven","slug":"luckless-seven","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/luckless-seven","created_at":1429078686347,"updated_at":1522407019810,"summary":"Luckless Seven is the story of Mark Vesco\u2019s coming of age. Once an inspired youngster, Mark finds himself living a listless, dutiful existence just two years out of high school. When a group of old friends contacts Mark about reuniting with them, the stars align to allow him to join his old friends in a nationwide competitive tournament. \n \nTake control of Mark as he and six friends set out to compete in Arithia\u2019s most popular game, Ekosi. This fast and fun card game is inspired by KOTOR\u2019s Pazaak, and the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. With a little experience, money, and luck, take Mark from a modest amateur to an Ekosi champion! \n \nWhich card to play won\u2019t be the only difficult choice for Mark, though. Along his journey, Mark will have to make several decisions that will challenge him morally, ethically, and socially. More than just a card game, Luckless Seven invites you to take control of the whole person. Who will Mark be on his quest for glory?","storyline":"The game will put players in the shoes of Mark, a young adult drifting through life. Bored of his dead end job and feeling less risk averse than usual, Mark decides to take a leap of faith and joins his friends on a cross-country Ekosi tour. \n \nEkosi is the name of the card game used as the battle system for Luckless Seven. The foundation for the card game was inspired by Pazaak, a minigame from Bioware\u2019s 2003 hit Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. Both Ekosi and Pazaak are similar to Blackjack but have a few key differences such as players having a hand in which they can play cards to manipulate their score. \n \nBesides battling other characters, players will travel with a group of Mark\u2019s childhood friends. Each of the characters that travels with Mark will have a prominent role in the story and fully developed character arcs. The player\u2019s interactions with his party members and other characters in the story will determine what dialogue choices they can make and how their story will conclude. \n \nThe game will have a top-down isometric view and feature an overworld that the player can explore. Numerous NPCs scattered throughout the world will engage the player in Ekosi battles. Players will unlock new cards and additional quests by taking the time to explore the world and challenge other characters. The player will also have numerous interactions with their party throughout each stage of their journey. \n \nThe players will have more options and strategies available to them as they win more cards. Besides collecting powerful cards, the player will also be able to interact with many NPCs and witness many story-creating events when they explore Arithia\u2019s cities. By taking the time to interact with the world\u2019s characters and participating in each party member\u2019s story arcs, the player will level up their character and unlock additional story events, dialogue trees, and endings.","hypes":5,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[25311,55289,72412,26145,26163,75813,47823,19301,36044,25300],"tags":[268435468,268435471,268435487,268435488,536871195,536872433,536872435,536872436,536872437,536872438,1073741826],"developers":[5224],"publishers":[5224],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[283,1521,1523,1524,1525,1526],"genres":[12,15,31,32],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"status":2,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/twveaftoc6l4y08fxqoz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"twveaftoc6l4y08fxqoz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ltq2vekminezokdvoejx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ltq2vekminezokdvoejx","width":1614,"height":904},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vv03zisegonuewiwefbf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vv03zisegonuewiwefbf","width":1920,"height":907},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/imosshlaoojvibgcwxvk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"imosshlaoojvibgcwxvk","width":1920,"height":909},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mhkexyeir3cwiqerxxmk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mhkexyeir3cwiqerxxmk","width":1615,"height":909}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"7doinPDSJj4"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"e4g-czk0Edk"},{"name":"Gameplay Tutorial","video_id":"2xCkJdH6QW8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fempwcnxv0kyppa5ilib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fempwcnxv0kyppa5ilib","width":1536,"height":616},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.lucklessseven.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/433370"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lucklessseven"}],"external":{"steam":"433370"}}
