You can play as either Sonic or Blaze as you try to track down powerful Sol emeralds. Sonic Rush displays the level over both screens, allowing for screen-spanning jumps and dives. Some gameplay modes include stylus support as well. \n \nDesigned as a 2.5D side-scroller, Sonic Rush is the first game in the Sonic series to explore both 2D and 3D venues by combining two-dimensional environments with three-dimensional models. In 2007, the game received a sequel, Sonic Rush Adventure.","collection":2156,"franchise":814,"franchises":[814],"rating":73.20253171482909,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":75,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":74.10126585741455,"total_rating_count":24,"rating_count":22,"games":[6283,4156,2933,6599,21062,358,3192,7862,1223,506],"tags":[1,268435464,536871075,536871208,536871306,536871487,536871501,536871506,536871645,536871971,536872010,536872098,536872211,536872961,536873064,536874398,536874743,536874745,536874824,536875073,536875074,536875076,536875088,536875101,536875128,536875199,536875201,536875209,536875213,536875228,536875241,536875367,536875369,536875370,536875371,536875396,536875413,536875435,536875437,536875441,536875453,536875489,536875523,536875658,536875689,536875740,536875816,536875819,536875855,536875870,536875883,536875902,536875934,536875941,536875954,536876120,536876214,536876318,536876470,536876713,536876827,536876850,536876947,536876952,536877006,536877029,536877099,536877399,536877406,536877723,536877839,536878033,536878132,536878149,536878192,536878256,536878566,536883921,536884021,1073741828],"developers":[395],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[163,296,394,575,589,594,733,1059,1098,1186,1299,2049,2152,3486,3831,3833,3912,4161,4162,4164,4176,4189,4216,4287,4289,4297,4301,4316,4329,4455,4457,4458,4459,4484,4501,4523,4525,4529,4541,4577,4611,4746,4777,4828,4904,4907,4943,4958,4971,4990,5022,5029,5042,5208,5302,5406,5558,5801,5915,5938,6035,6040,6094,6117,6187,6487,6494,6811,6927,7121,7220,7237,7280,7344,7654,13009,13109],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1132012800000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1132272000000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Nov-18","y":2005,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1132012800000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Nov-15","y":2005,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1132704000000,"region":5,"human":"2005-Nov-23","y":2005,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30bd\u30cb\u30c3\u30af\u30fb\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5 ","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sjpcnzujpuwnhywighyg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sjpcnzujpuwnhywighyg","width":256,"height":432},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fc6d4ux9ldhyxsguujg2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fc6d4ux9ldhyxsguujg2","width":256,"height":432},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ebnvssjt44axffvbf0ba.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ebnvssjt44axffvbf0ba","width":256,"height":432},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tkvzo3iu7z8f6xojty27.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tkvzo3iu7z8f6xojty27","width":256,"height":432},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zdfarpbpnbirkyoepq70.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zdfarpbpnbirkyoepq70","width":256,"height":432}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1ibu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1ibu","width":800,"height":715},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sonic_Rush"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/sonic.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sonic_Rush"}]}
