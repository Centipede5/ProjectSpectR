The game features more than 80 new features and improvements, including a deeper, more customizable franchise mode. The biggest change comes in the interface. You still hit the same buttons to swing, bunt, steal, and field, but the batting cursor has been visually altered. It's still the same triangle shape as before, just with a different outline. Bunting is more unique, though. Instead of aiming the cursor when you go to bunt, a large arrow points on the ground. Aim your bunt in the desired direction and hope for the best. Fielding has also received a slight change, with the ball cursor changing color. Four up to four players.","collection":1550,"popularity":1,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":5,"games":[10624,54662,10663,44242,18623,69229,22470,29173,22425,26145],"tags":[32,268435469,268435470,536870932,536872060,536872078,536875138,536875562,536875570,536876150,536876165,536876190,536878507,1073741826],"developers":[2005],"publishers":[287],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[20,1148,1166,4226,4650,4658,5238,5253,5278,7595],"themes":[32],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":1046131200000,"platforms":[11,21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1046304000000,"human":"2003-Feb-27","y":2003,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1046736000000,"human":"2003-Mar-04","y":2003,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1046131200000,"human":"2003-Feb-25","y":2003,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s1aiimdxkfbkrbkdbalr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s1aiimdxkfbkrbkdbalr","width":1538,"height":1970},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
