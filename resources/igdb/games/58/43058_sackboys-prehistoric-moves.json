One player uses the PlayStation Move motion controller as a pointing device to manipulate the environment by triggering switches and moving platforms, while the others play using a gamepad to control Sackboy in the usual way.

It was made available to other users in North America on 14 December 2010 and in Europe on 15 December 2010.[110] The game was also bundled with LittleBigPlanet 2 when it was released in January 2011.[108] \n \nReception[edit]","popularity":1,"publishers":[13634],"category":0,"first_release_date":1292284800000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1292371200000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Dec-15","y":2010,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1292284800000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Dec-14","y":2010,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1294963200000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Jan-14","y":2011,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pfdgnhdush5dhrrffcff.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pfdgnhdush5dhrrffcff","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dn3zmnzbclk7f6hlfphz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dn3zmnzbclk7f6hlfphz","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ukdadnkwceymbxzmjbjg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ukdadnkwceymbxzmjbjg","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vxtwty08hv1swheukr2p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vxtwty08hv1swheukr2p","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/er5s9vc6c3rsohmvfskh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"er5s9vc6c3rsohmvfskh","width":960,"height":540}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jbyh3agoea39yxo9fgvd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jbyh3agoea39yxo9fgvd","width":500,"height":250}}
