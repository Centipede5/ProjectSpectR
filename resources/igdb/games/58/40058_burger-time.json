The game's original Japanese title, Hamburger (\u30cf\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc?), was changed to BurgerTime before its introduction to the United States. \n \nIn the United States, Data East USA licensed BurgerTime for distribution by Bally Midway as a standard dedicated arcade game. Data East also released its own version of BurgerTime in the US through the DECO Cassette System. The Data East and Midway versions are distinguished by the manufacturer's name on the title screen and by the marquee and cabinet artworks, as the game itself is identical.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25640,25311,36608,34919,11362,9760,33603,36962,40524,55888],"tags":[1,268435471],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":381369600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":381369600000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Feb-01","y":1982,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aplghf2yaptk0i89gmmx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aplghf2yaptk0i89gmmx","width":850,"height":1137}}
