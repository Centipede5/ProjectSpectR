The game was one of the nine launch titles offered when the Atari 2600 went on sale in September 1977. The player's objective is simple: solve basic arithmetic problems. Game variations determine whether the player solves addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems, and whether he\/she could select the top number (the console randomly selects the lower number). The player uses the joystick to enter a guess, with sound effects signaling whether it is right or wrong.","collection":3564,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[80046,79085,58477,77007,34218,72373,29526,58575,35722,18435],"tags":[34,536871446,536871830,536872216,536872419,536872475,536873584,536874706,536875046,536875096,536875143,536875144,536875145,536875151,536875236,536875435,536875733,536876082,536877385,536877756,536878492,536880000],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[534,918,1304,1507,1563,2672,3794,4134,4184,4231,4232,4233,4239,4324,4523,4821,5170,6473,6844,7580,9088],"themes":[34],"first_release_date":241920000000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":59,"date":241920000000,"human":"1977-Sep","y":1977,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Fun With Numbers","comment":"Other"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"va5C4PSgvrQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mocwiobzsjzbcrdf06hv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mocwiobzsjzbcrdf06hv","width":600,"height":812}}
