However, Twisted Metal 2 does feature many new notable gameplay mechanics. One addition is vehicle-common advanced moves. These moves allow players to press button combinations in order to perform special rechargeable maneuvers such as cloak , shield, and a napalm blast. Cars can catch on fire after being attacked with weapons such as napalm, which will slowly deteriorate their health. Health pick-ups allow players to heal themselves in a more sensible fashion than that of the first game.","collection":709,"franchise":361,"franchises":[361],"rating":71.2669118793021,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":73,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":72.13345593965104,"total_rating_count":22,"rating_count":21,"games":[4695,4698,4697,5413,1192,26658,19561,26192,7631,37016],"tags":[1,19,20,21,27,268435460,268435461,268435466,536870937,536870981,536871041,536871213,536871226,536871262,536871470,536871537,536871618,536872032,536872225,536872352,536872651,536872695,536872983,536873512,536874398,536874539,536875073,536875122,536875179,536875198,536875199,536875208,536875284,536875573,536875606,536875691,536875707,536875715,536875825,536875941,536876062,536876066,536876199,536876240,536876266,536876293,536876348,536876365,536876415,536876419,536876511,536877169,536877285,536877517,536877744,536877938,536877967,536877982,536878439,536879704,536880441,536880761,536880837,536883566,536883622,536884026,536884403,536884863,536886401,1073741826],"developers":[2098],"publishers":[45],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[25,69,129,301,314,350,558,625,706,1120,1313,1440,1739,1783,2071,2600,3486,3627,4161,4210,4267,4286,4287,4296,4372,4661,4694,4779,4795,4803,4913,5029,5150,5154,5287,5328,5354,5381,5436,5453,5503,5507,5599,6257,6373,6605,6832,7026,7055,7070,7527,8792,9529,9849,9925,12654,12710,13114,13491,13951,15489],"themes":[1,19,20,21,27],"genres":[4,5,10],"first_release_date":846720000000,"platforms":[45,6,7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":846720000000,"human":"1996-Oct-31","y":1996,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":879379200000,"human":"1997-Nov-13","y":1997,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1185408000000,"human":"2007-Jul-26","y":2007,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Twisted Metal 2: World Tour"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jsqgqpvkxyoiuxqgphy2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jsqgqpvkxyoiuxqgphy2","width":512,"height":384}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/otrtrx9wwlwsaw8bxbwh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"otrtrx9wwlwsaw8bxbwh","width":500,"height":500},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Twisted_Metal"}]}
