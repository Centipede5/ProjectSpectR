Ten tough-nuts have come forward, such as Burke the squaddie and Eric the biker. Many of these have special moves in which they can turn into an animal - Tong Lee can become a tiger and Lorente a puma. \n \nSpecial moves are selected using a combination of joystick\/pad movements followed by a tap of fire. The game can be played with or without blood, and in a turbo speed mode, with tournament and tag-team options for potential multi-player tournaments. The game supports CD32 controllers as well as one-button joysticks.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[29173,55590,18623,9199,19934,55689,44242,23345,19376,33603],"tags":[268435460,268435469,268435471,536871327,536872060,536874694,1073741828],"developers":[6381],"publishers":[3190],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[415,1148,3782],"genres":[4,13,15],"first_release_date":851990400000,"platforms":[114,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":851990400000,"human":"1996","y":1996,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":851990400000,"human":"1996","y":1996,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hmm7g9o99mzbnwsss2vf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hmm7g9o99mzbnwsss2vf","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mnb6e393wkulm2xi5yfu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mnb6e393wkulm2xi5yfu","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kvjt3qv2pa6gyxn4oitl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kvjt3qv2pa6gyxn4oitl","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r1l0defon0owktjp52uj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r1l0defon0owktjp52uj","width":640,"height":862}}
