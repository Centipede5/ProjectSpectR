Become an ace in one day like Yeager in World War II, fight Sabres high over the Yalu River in Korea, fly in the biggest air battle of Vietnam. \nKorean War. \n \nJet aircraft dominate the skies. Tactical updates on call. You have a Sabre in your sights, but is he alone? Info windows give you critical data on enemy locations, plane performance, even your opponent's next move. \n \nMissiles make their first deadly mark. Accurate flight dynamics. Faster speeds and greater Gs put your pilot skills to the test. Gunning fighters over Germany was hard, but a missile lock at Mach 1 is a whole different ballgame.","popularity":2,"games":[44242,18623,22470,29173,22425,26145,55590,55689,22406,23867],"tags":[268435469,536870913,536870968,536871904,536872060,536872129,536873753,536874982,536875061,536875171,536876296,536879629,536879693,536879827],"category":0,"keywords":[1,56,992,1148,1217,2841,4070,4149,4259,5384,8717,8781,8915],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nk2epaxvzjxppdj2u5kt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nk2epaxvzjxppdj2u5kt","width":800,"height":984},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chuck_Yeager%27s_Air_Combat"}]}
