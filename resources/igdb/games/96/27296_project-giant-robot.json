The Wii U's gyroscope sensor would be used to keep your robot standing during the fight. \n \nThe game had been in development for years and was shown at E3 2014 but development was canceled on February 1st, 2017.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36950,68287,71455,25300,28029,142,64204,27314,10039,25311],"tags":[1,18,268435460,536871019,536871882,536876227,536876252,1073741826,1073741825],"developers":[7902],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[107,970,5315,5340],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":1483142400000,"status":6,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[41],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":41,"date":1483142400000,"region":1,"human":"2016","y":2016,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":41,"date":1483142400000,"region":2,"human":"2016","y":2016,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/h8r3fjukj9i8qobrtlj1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h8r3fjukj9i8qobrtlj1","width":1920,"height":1330}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"OAWU16gcELc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uzag8cmwvcszngggp5ki.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uzag8cmwvcszngggp5ki","width":2044,"height":1416}}
