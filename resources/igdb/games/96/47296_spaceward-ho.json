The first version was released in 1990, and further upgrades followed regularly; the current version, 5.0.5, was released on July 8, 2003. It has received wide recognition in the Macintosh community, for example being inducted into the Macworld Game Hall of Fame. \n \nSpaceward Ho! can be categorized in the 4X game genre (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) with a theme of galactic conquest. It took many elements of its design from the earlier Reach for the Stars, but expanded on many of that game's basic themes while taking advantage of the larger memory and better graphics available on the Mac platform.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19350,11582,11550,16513,19301,9789,29173,10034,68287,55036],"tags":[536871327,536871416,536871859,536871882,536872956,536874694,536875362,536876566,536877142],"category":0,"keywords":[415,504,947,970,2044,3782,4450,5654,6230],"themes":[18,41],"genres":[15],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/skhdcupgfjih3jxzn4z0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"skhdcupgfjih3jxzn4z0","width":256,"height":323},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
