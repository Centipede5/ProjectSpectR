As a Hunter, you have the special gift--or curse--to recognize and destroy the evil that has come back from the dead to dwell the earth. This time, an evil cult has formed in Ashcroft and it's up to Hunters to destroy it. Choose from five playable characters--each with unique weapons, edges, and supernatural abilities--and fight crowds of monstrous enemies. Based on White Wolf's pen-and-paper role-playing game, Hunter: The Reckoning Wayward combines an intense storyline, deadly characters, and gothic environments.","collection":850,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[13189,25646,26914,11296,1905,7329,19561,36926,12198,1907],"tags":[1,19,268435487,536871041,536871123,536871138,536871139,536871213,536871301,536871938,536871939,536872032,536873176,536874182,536875098,536875483,536875484,536875572,536875573,536875610,536875728,536875743,536875891,536876301,536877319,536877501,536878004,536878096,536880639],"category":0,"keywords":[129,211,226,227,301,389,1026,1027,1120,2264,3270,4186,4571,4572,4660,4661,4698,4816,4831,4979,5389,6407,6589,7092,7184,9727],"themes":[1,19],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1065657600000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1065657600000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Oct-09","y":2003,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/papbo3b2vhdvuttitwkt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"papbo3b2vhdvuttitwkt","width":1496,"height":2116},"esrb":{"rating":6},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":8,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
