Family Quiz 4 Man Rivalry) is a Japanese trivia game devloped by Athena for the Famicom, and published in Japan in November of 1988. This game was Athena's first console release. With a focus on family play, the game allows for four players to compete simultaneously. The goal is to beat the other opponents in four mini-games, each requiring that the player answer some Japanese trivia questions in order to proceed. The four mini-games are based on a game show, a board-game, the game of Othello, and a memory match game. In the game show, the only version that allows for just one player, answering questions correctly raises that player's podium towards a balloon. The other versions require at least two players, and turns may only be taken after players have answered a trivia question correctly.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28213,25217,19082,11588,19083,74498,11529,5161,12940,51028],"tags":[268435465,268435482,536871186,536871684,536873513,536873516,536875051,536875240],"category":0,"keywords":[274,772,2601,2604,4139,4328],"genres":[9,26],"first_release_date":595641600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":595641600000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Nov-16","y":1988,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":598233600000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Dec-16","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zcxrzentirv3rxoql1f2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zcxrzentirv3rxoql1f2","width":199,"height":138}}
