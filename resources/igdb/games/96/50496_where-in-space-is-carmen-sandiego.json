The player flies in a rocket ship throughout the solar system, interrogating various alien lifeforms in order to solve the theft of an important part of the solar system (e.g. Saturn's rings). There was only a limited amount of fuel available for travel. So if the player didn't ask the right questions on the right planets, or followed the wrong clues, the criminal(s) would get away, leaving the player to start over again with another crime.
