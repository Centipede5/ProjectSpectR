You play as a hunter looking to catch a nice trophy in one of four different areas using three different weapons. Hunt deer with a shotgun, a rifle, or a bow, using slightly different tactics with each. If you want to be successful, you'll have to use real-world hunting strategies. Search for droppings or other signs of movement to find the best area to wait in. Once there, use one of an assortment of tools to help you catch your prey: mask your odor with a cover scent, use a tree stand to camouflage yourself, or lure the deer with a powerful musk, a deer call, or an antler rattle. It's up to you to decide how to catch the deer; some methods are more efficient than others, so you'll have to find the one that works best for you. Detailed graphics and digitized sound round out the experience for would-be hunters.","collection":49,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44242,18623,22470,29173,26145,22425,55689,55590,23867,22406],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536870976,536871838,536872060],"category":0,"keywords":[64,926,1148],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":948499200000,"platforms":[22,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1072051200000,"region":2,"human":"2003-Dec-22","y":2003,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":948499200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jan-22","y":2000,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jgj2vcn6tispqzglqjot.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jgj2vcn6tispqzglqjot","width":640,"height":908},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
