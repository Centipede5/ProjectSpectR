In single-player mode, players can switch turtles on the fly in order to accomplish the various tasks. Throughout some levels, the turtles also have racing sections over various terrains. \n \nAs players progress through the game, they can find secret items, abilities, and power-ups, including the original late 1980's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade game.","collection":3220,"franchise":77,"franchises":[77],"rating":60.7577573708176,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":54,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":57.3788786854088,"total_rating_count":6,"rating_count":5,"games":[4197,18639,46975,48927,78938,48928,3817,26820,64244,19747],"tags":[1,268435466,268435481,536870973,536871075,536871076,536871139,536871571,536872234,536872981,536873671,536874688,536875054,536875069,536875074,536875180,536875271,536875291,536875445,536875450,536875451,536875654,536875717,536875945,536875947,536875948,536876208,536876611,536876694,536877029,536877713,536878471,536878505,536879682,536882023,536882308,536884022,1073741827],"developers":[129],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[61,163,164,227,659,1322,2069,2759,3776,4142,4157,4162,4268,4359,4379,4533,4538,4539,4742,4805,5033,5035,5036,5296,5699,5782,6117,6801,7559,7593,8770,11111,11396,13110],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,25],"first_release_date":1098144000000,"platforms":[6,11,24,21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1098144000000,"human":"2004-Oct-19","y":2004,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1098144000000,"human":"2004-Oct-19","y":2004,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1098144000000,"human":"2004-Oct-19","y":2004,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1098144000000,"human":"2004-Oct-19","y":2004,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1098144000000,"human":"2004-Oct-19","y":2004,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"TMNT 2: Battle Nexus","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w4s2yn0vv8drm0xizoub.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w4s2yn0vv8drm0xizoub","width":256,"height":357},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
