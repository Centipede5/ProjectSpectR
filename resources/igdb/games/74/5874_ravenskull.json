Due to lower hardware specifications, the Acorn Electron version used a much smaller playing window and the speed scrolls were omitted.","storyline":"The player is tasked with entering Baron Strieg's Castle Ravenskull in order to defend the village of Austberg and retrieve a stolen silver crucifix, which has been split into quarters and found on four different levels of the castle. \n \nThe player may choose from one of four character types: an Adventurer, a Wizard, a Warrior or an Elf. The choice defines both the graphics for the character's player and the treasure pieces to be collected.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[37088,19289,25222,25646,236,37094,47823,16468,27266,1221],"tags":[1,17,22,268435465,268435487,536871063,536871939,1073741827],"developers":[650],"publishers":[1120],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,1027],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[9,31],"first_release_date":512611200000,"platforms":[134,69],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":134,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":3,"platform":69,"date":512611200000,"region":1,"human":"1986-Q1","y":1986,"m":3}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"euhIW6fVQdU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fv5bdoytifukkstrge1y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fv5bdoytifukkstrge1y","width":587,"height":819}}
