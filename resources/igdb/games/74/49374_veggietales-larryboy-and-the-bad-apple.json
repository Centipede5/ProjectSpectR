When trouble appears, the citizens of Bumblyburg call world-famous crime fighter LarryBoy! Aided only by his trusted butler Alfred (played with zest by Archibald Asparagus), LarryBoy is everything that his alter-ego Larry the Cucumber is not: bold... confident... relentlessly driven... brazenly heroic! Well, actually, that's not entirely true. While he tries to create this impression, inside, LarryBoy is still plain-old Larry. LarryBoy attempts to save the day with clever use of his super-suction ears and the many features of the Larry-Mobile. Call him a kinder, gentler, slightly slower superhero!","collection":4456,"popularity":1,"games":[19565,59516,22425,25311,23175,25646,36926,55289,47823,25300],"tags":[1,268435487,536870926,536871931,536872014,536872475,536873299,536875054,536875074,536875095,536875271,536875291,536875292,536876328,536876375,536877314,536877434,536879171],"category":0,"keywords":[14,1019,1102,1563,2387,4142,4162,4183,4359,4379,4380,5416,5463,6402,6522,8259],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1157068800000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1157068800000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Sep-01","y":2006,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sootno90ootlcotrrjfc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sootno90ootlcotrrjfc","width":500,"height":500},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
