This squad can then be developed into a winning unit using the game's exhaustive training and tactics functions.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[29173,54662,44242,55689,55590,40470,18623,9199,22470,11679],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536870938,536871906,536872060],"category":0,"keywords":[26,994,1148],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":1230422400000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1230422400000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Dec-28","y":2008,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bo7fnlqgo1ucwag0gjzd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bo7fnlqgo1ucwag0gjzd","width":256,"height":384}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tk4cfdeaxl1zxk7adysj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tk4cfdeaxl1zxk7adysj","width":640,"height":575},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
