Gamers participate in single player or co-op modes as Point Man, a genetically enhanced super soldier originally introduced in F.E.A.R., or they can play cooperatively as his conniving brother Paxton Fettel, whose incredible telekinetic power has given him life beyond the grave. The game is developed by Day 1 Studios, developer of the original F.E.A.R. console games in collaboration with Monolith Studios.","collection":95,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"version_parent":514,"version_title":"Collectors Edition","games":[28029,36950,29525,25646,25311,68287,12579,68142,76229,27314],"tags":[1,18,19,268435461,268435487],"category":0,"themes":[1,18,19],"genres":[5,31],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bciu6kdtds80praycovp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bciu6kdtds80praycovp","width":1280,"height":720}]}
