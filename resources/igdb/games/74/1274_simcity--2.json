The model-like world and detail of the simulation make this the most responsive and personal SimCity ever. This is also the most expansive city management game yet where you can control a region that delivers true multi-city scale and play a single city or up to 16 cities at once each with different specializations. Multiplayer is also a first for the series, which adds a new dimension to your game as your decisions impact both your city and your region and creates new ways to play by collaborating or competing to earn achievements.","collection":90,"franchise":1017,"franchises":[1017],"rating":76.06382498093039,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":60.0769230769231,"aggregated_rating_count":15,"total_rating":68.07037402892675,"total_rating_count":82,"rating_count":67,"games":[7046,9066,18425,2002,29173,5447,55590,26651,1272,330],"tags":[28,33,268435469,268435471,536870933,536870972,536871033,536871441,536871561,536871906,536872010,536872060,536872245,536872315,536872511,536872578,536872954,536873249,536873449,536873753,536874445,536874694,536874706,536874906,536875058,536875059,536875098,536875154,536875432,536875453,536875649,536875730,536875885,536876257,536876274,536876759,536876797,536876915,536877174,536877325,536877846,536878043,536879111,536879696,536880177,536881389,536882404,1073741827],"developers":[284],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[34],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[21,60,121,529,649,994,1098,1148,1333,1403,1599,1666,2042,2337,2537,2841,3533,3782,3794,3994,4146,4147,4186,4242,4520,4541,4737,4818,4973,5345,5362,5847,5885,6003,6262,6413,6934,7131,8199,8784,9265,10477,11492],"themes":[28,33],"genres":[13,15],"expansions":[20106],"first_release_date":1362441600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1362441600000,"human":"2013-Mar-05","y":2013,"m":3},{"category":1,"platform":14,"date":1375315200000,"human":"2013-Aug","y":2013,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sim City Graphics Set 2: Future Cities","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Sim City","comment":"Other"},{"name":"The SimCity","comment":"Other"},{"name":"SimCity V","comment":"Other"},{"name":"SimCity 5","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i5qdp84vrf4sxpluopvp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i5qdp84vrf4sxpluopvp","width":640,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qxm3ulojh3h0exjeuu42.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qxm3ulojh3h0exjeuu42","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j45bvanfpf6n9lmsghp6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j45bvanfpf6n9lmsghp6","width":640,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rwwml8yywhmqytildg22.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rwwml8yywhmqytildg22","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ycqp79ao55h4rwunyiev.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ycqp79ao55h4rwunyiev","width":2528,"height":1408}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"yWLClUwAHGc"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"uFa3ET9FUzI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/csbqnva4b4nzdjgkbe8c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"csbqnva4b4nzdjgkbe8c","width":1530,"height":2157},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a simulation game in which players create and expand fictional cities by managing resources and keeping their population content. From a birds-eye perspective, players build residences, factories, and civic structures to improve city conditions; certain actions (e.g. building a casino) may cause crime to increase in the city. Murder is sometimes referenced in the text (e.g., a news ticker displays \u201cShocking murder puts local police in the spotlight\u201d); small figures can be seen robbing banks and engaging in shootouts with police. Players are also able to deploy natural and fantastical disasters on the city (e.g., tornadoes, flaming meteors, fires, giant monsters, destructive robots).","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Pictures or sounds likely to be scary to young children - Violence that is not shown but is implied - Non realistic looking violence towards characters which although human are not very detailed\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.simcity.com"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":16,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
