Your company computer is a demented psychopath, and all you really want to do is get home, sit down and have a nice cup of tea. \n \nTo make matters worse, you have to build a new rocket and refuel it before you can get away. All this while your oxygen supply is running out, meteors fly and aliens try to squish you. \n \nAt least there is the odd precious stone to supplement your meagre pay. You may even meet an exotic alien princess if you're lucky. \n \nSpace travel doesn't get dafter than this! \n \nDeveloped for the Commodore 64 home computer, ROCKET SMASH EX is an extended version of Saul Cross and John Christian L\u00f8nningdal's ROCKET SMASH, released in 2013 as an entry in RGCD's annual 16KB gamedev competition. \n \nYour goal is simple; on each of the single-screen levels you must reassemble and refuel your crashed rocket ship before your oxygen runs out. However, the hordes of fearsome aliens and deadly meteor showers on each planet will ensure that your mission is far from easy! \n \nROCKET SMASH EX features: \n \n Rockets! Aliens! Meteors! Lasers! \n Story and pure arcade 'loop' game modes! \n Three difficulty levels! \n Cutscenes!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1425168000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":1425168000000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Mar-01","y":2015,"m":3}]}
