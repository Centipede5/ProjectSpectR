AniMatch will also keep your kids quiet while they play it again, and again, and again.... right when you need that much-needed break in a restaurant, on a plane, or in a car. \n\nWhile kids can play the game all on their own, it is even more fun when you take turns and play AniMatch with them!

There are no complicated menus for kids to get confused by, or multiple options to get lost in. The moment the game loads, kids can start playing it right away - it is so simple and engaging that we have seen even 11-month olds interact with it!
