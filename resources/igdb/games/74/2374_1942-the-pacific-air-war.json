{"id":2374,"name":"1942: The Pacific Air War","slug":"1942-the-pacific-air-war","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/1942-the-pacific-air-war","created_at":1372797677824,"updated_at":1523425879385,"summary":"From December of 1941 through the end of the World War, the combined forces of Japan fought the armed forces of the United States of America over a broad stretch of ocean peppered with islands. This was the Pacific campaign, one of the bloodiest, toughest-fought campaigns in all of recorded history. Though all of the forces involved were essential parts of the eventual outcome, naval aviation played a special part. The carrier forces of both sides proved their worth time and again.\n\nThe idea behind 1942: The Pacific Air War is to re-create some of the adventure of that time and place and give you a chance to take part in it. To succeed, you have to avoid that oil- and blood-soaked, fire-on-water grave long enough to be of service to your country or your Emperor. As a commanding admiral of the navy, a crack fighter pilot, or just an anonymous Joe tail gunner, you are going to fight for recognition and just plain survival. The Japanese are moving south and east like a steamroller, trying to take control of the Pacific. The Americans are fighting back, desperately hoping to drain the strength from the Japanese juggernaut.","collection":5101,"rating":50,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":0,"rating_count":0,"games":[18623,22399,23345,33603,640,36962,55888,65827,28244,2015],"tags":[22,268435469,268435471,536870914,536870931,536870968,536871188,536871201,536871904,536875137,1073741825],"developers":[152],"publishers":[152],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2,19,56,276,289,992,4225],"themes":[22],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ic3ffdmunsvpsyks280p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ic3ffdmunsvpsyks280p","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tjssgvtv2fd0gyuauhir.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tjssgvtv2fd0gyuauhir","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lvomgz80jsmxtoucbevg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lvomgz80jsmxtoucbevg","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uqfphni5cl9mrxnksqn3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uqfphni5cl9mrxnksqn3","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vxxi4ozybihr3kwppryx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vxxi4ozybihr3kwppryx","width":1280,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/va1fizgepckhvj1qzntp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"va1fizgepckhvj1qzntp","width":1212,"height":1383},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.retroism.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/347230"}],"external":{"steam":"347230"}}
