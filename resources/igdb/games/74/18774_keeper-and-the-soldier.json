Keeper and the Soldier uses symbolism and fantasy to the tales of a young girl's struggles; inspired by real ordeals. \n \nOur team is a strong supporter against child abuse and neglect, and we hope to contribute to and plan future charitable\/awareness events towards this cause.","hypes":1,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[106279,27266,25311,25646,26145,56033,28070,26658,18011,24426],"tags":[18,19,20,21,23,34,268435464,268435465,268435471,268435487,268435488,536871962,536873284,536873285,1073741828],"developers":[2917],"publishers":[2917],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1050,2372,2373],"themes":[18,19,20,21,23,34],"genres":[8,9,15,31,32],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"status":2,"platforms":[92],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":92,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"KATS","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fhzwnkxgugrmzidoniy7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhzwnkxgugrmzidoniy7","width":2866,"height":1426},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d68yzqgmqlwckcgrat64.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d68yzqgmqlwckcgrat64","width":2860,"height":1516},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fqrjtv1jfiv2zi3pvowp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fqrjtv1jfiv2zi3pvowp","width":2864,"height":1522},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pib5wob4kvvc7urhldkp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pib5wob4kvvc7urhldkp","width":2866,"height":1510},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/twjzk54jj8fa5bms07up.jpg","cloudinary_id":"twjzk54jj8fa5bms07up","width":2862,"height":1522}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dp5kzso4ieqiyrpmrrqh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dp5kzso4ieqiyrpmrrqh","width":609,"height":609},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.keeperandthesoldier.com\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/jbskats"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/KATSproject"}]}
