Developed by Tim Skelly while working at Cinematronics, it was released under the Vectorbeam company name shortly before Cinematronics closed Vectorbeam down. The game featured two dueling knights rendered in monochrome vector graphics and based on crude motion capture techniques. Due to the limitations of the hardware used, the processor could not render the characters and gaming environment at the same time and backgrounds were printed, with the characters projected on the top.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,75089,1235,10039,25311,68287,41828,71455,142,36794],"tags":[1,18,268435460,536871019,1073741827],"developers":[1139],"publishers":[8441],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[107],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":307584000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":52,"date":307584000000,"human":"1979-Oct","y":1979,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pogabqzodepcztihvj1s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pogabqzodepcztihvj1s","width":1280,"height":1024}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j9kx9ssvlyrtbzpfful5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j9kx9ssvlyrtbzpfful5","width":2000,"height":3008}}
