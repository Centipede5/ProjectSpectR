To win, a player must place four of their symbols on four squares that line up vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, on a single grid, or spaced evenly over all four grids. This creates a total of 76 possible ways to win, in comparison to eight possible ways to win on a standard 3\u00d73 board. The game has nine variations: it can be played by two players against each other, or one player can play against a built-in AI on one of eight different difficulty settings. The game uses the standard joystick controller.","collection":3008,"popularity":2,"games":[19083,55036,28472,77768,77597,32510,29173,17613,36553,9472],"tags":[268435471,268435482,536872407,536873513,536874694,536875051,536876005],"developers":[82],"publishers":[82],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1495,2601,3782,4139,5093],"genres":[15,26],"first_release_date":315446400000,"platforms":[59,65,126],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":126,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981-Dec-31","y":1981,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":65,"date":378604800000,"region":2,"human":"1981-Dec-31","y":1981,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":347068800000,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":315446400000,"human":"1979","y":1979,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wwirei4t3m4e4hi1q0re.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wwirei4t3m4e4hi1q0re","width":320,"height":200}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"cQiKut1p_vc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qvan5j6ufxstptsjppcu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qvan5j6ufxstptsjppcu","width":600,"height":827}}
