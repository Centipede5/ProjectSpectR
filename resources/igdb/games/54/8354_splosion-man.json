Players' objective is to get 'Splosion Man' out of the laboratory by running through levels and triggering fiery explosions in front of scientists, robots, and monsters made out of meat. When enemies explode, they turn into 'cartoony' hams, sausages, T-bone steaks, and other cuts of meat. A scientist can also be used as shield against robot guns; when the scientist is shot, he laughs and giggles as turkey legs and donuts fly out of him.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards fantasy characters","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.splosionman.com\/"}]}
