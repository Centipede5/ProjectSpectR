You can enter the Practice mode in order to train yourself on individual events, or you can go for broke and play the full 10-event Decathlon. Each event has a minimum time, distance, or height you must beat in order to qualify. Three difficulty levels are available: Amateur, Olympic and Super Pro. \n \nEvents are as follows: 100 Meter Dash, Broad Jump, Shot-Put, High Jump, Triple Jump, 110 Meter Hurdles, Discus Throw, Pole Vault, Javelin Throw and 400 M. Dash. Most of the events require running, which is done by quickly tapping alternate sides of the disc repeatedly or by spinning the disc.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[22690,81281,80876,80865,80456,80412,79667,79593,79464,79309],"tags":[268435470,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[1166],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":570672000000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":570672000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Feb-01","y":1988,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n2xtyiawbxzgamcjkz9t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n2xtyiawbxzgamcjkz9t","width":383,"height":512}}
