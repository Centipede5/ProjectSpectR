Though the game was marketed as a tie-in with the February 14th release of the Daredevil film, the GBA title is more based upon a less realistic, comic book design with bright and vibrant colors and the occasional \"Pow!\" and \"Bif!\" when knocking out opponents. Some levels cut across rooftops, others over vehicles in traffic; some go in buildings and underground. As players get through the 23 different levels, they'll uncover the game's original plot through comic book-style cutscenes.","collection":3147,"franchise":124,"franchises":[124,779],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19565,76253,14288,55112,26820,65603,76888,51525,43465,134],"tags":[1,268435481,536870926,536871894,536873299,536874452,536875054,536875222,536875294,536875736,536875874,536883757,1073741828],"developers":[62],"publishers":[338,197],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,982,2387,3540,4142,4310,4382,4824,4962,12845],"themes":[1],"genres":[25],"first_release_date":1044316800000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1044316800000,"region":2,"human":"2003-Feb-04","y":2003,"m":2}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vd9OswOkH8o"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cudgwyl6cpgz4hjaa66x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cudgwyl6cpgz4hjaa66x","width":225,"height":225},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
