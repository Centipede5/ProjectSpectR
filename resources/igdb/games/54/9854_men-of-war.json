{"id":9854,"name":"Men of War","slug":"men-of-war","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/men-of-war","created_at":1429483383485,"updated_at":1537022446342,"summary":"Men of War takes place in Europe and North Africa during the height of World War II. The story takes place over three different campaigns and players take on the role of Soviet, Allied and German soldiers. Each campaign has its own scenario and structured timeline, which brings different elements of the war to life. \n \nThe game features hundreds of accurately modelled historical tanks and vehicles \u2014 including new designs of tanks, APCs and heavy guns \u2014 all of which are ready for your command. Dynamic in-game cutscenes enhance the single-player by telling the plot, without pulling the player out of the game experience. What's more, the sounds of war have been given a new lease of life, with more than 1,000 sounds effects of weapons and combat gear; all recorded under real operating conditions. \n \nThe single-player campaign also features a customisable user-interface, so players can have the command controls laid out in their own style. One of the biggest changes for Men of War is the inclusion of a comprehensive multiplayer, featuring new maps and modes, including Capture the Flag, High-Value Cargo and more. Also, there's a refined rating system to ensure a fair fight in online multiplayer battles.","collection":245,"rating":79.1958721756196,"popularity":4.333333333333334,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":79.5979360878098,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":6,"games":[9477,619,10272,27475,3700,617,27091,5841,15894,654],"tags":[1,39,268435467,268435471,536870931,536871474,536871475,536872070,536872733,536874694,536874947,536875046,536875137,536875271,536875303,536875305,536875358,536875464,536875781,536876262,536876364,536876367,536876393,536876407,536876569,536876687,536877169,536877605,536877679,536877820,536878025,536879199,536879605,536879606,536879608,536879613,536879614,536879623,536879632,536879633,536879636,536880294,536880819,536881378,536881610,536883035,536883067,536883140,536883276,536883613,536883705,536884507,1073741826],"publishers":[3121,157],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[19,562,563,1158,1821,3782,4035,4134,4225,4359,4391,4393,4446,4552,4869,5350,5452,5455,5481,5495,5657,5775,6257,6693,6767,6908,7113,8287,8693,8694,8696,8701,8702,8711,8720,8721,8724,9382,9907,10466,10698,12123,12155,12228,12364,12701,12793,13595],"themes":[1,39],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":1236643200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1236643200000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Mar-10","y":2009,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bzcbghtplfdo2zctnxzf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bzcbghtplfdo2zctnxzf","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hs0l9nwy8v51byoar1eo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hs0l9nwy8v51byoar1eo","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vrtclhrkyyogwpdxsqyl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vrtclhrkyyogwpdxsqyl","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ylnm0dwyazto7swhtfbb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ylnm0dwyazto7swhtfbb","width":1440,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yeazmghfirpuemufityr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yeazmghfirpuemufityr","width":1440,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zsfklslrpjqfybaezk1k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zsfklslrpjqfybaezk1k","width":256,"height":362},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This real-time strategy game (RTS) is based on military campaigns fought by Soviet, German, and Allied forces during World War II.
