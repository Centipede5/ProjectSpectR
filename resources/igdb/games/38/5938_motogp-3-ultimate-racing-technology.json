MotoGP 3 is based off the 2002 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season, but with the introduction of four stroke bikes, the gameplay has some slight differences. The new 990cc 4-stroke bikes are faster, but tend to be a bit of a handful while the 500cc 2-strokes are less faster but slightly better to handle.","collection":744,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":79.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":79.5,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[27378,90688,104983,55192,103018,109292,88391,8268,7179,82090],"tags":[268435466,536870969],"developers":[2569,2597],"publishers":[197],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[57],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1114905600000,"platforms":[6,11,55],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":55,"date":1114905600000,"human":"2005-May","y":2005,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1125360000000,"human":"2005-Aug-30","y":2005,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1125360000000,"human":"2005-Aug-30","y":2005,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MotoGP 3"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ljyiofi8ucqriloypell.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ljyiofi8ucqriloypell","width":256,"height":310},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
