Berabo Man is a strange game - a platformer with underwater shoot 'em up stages (sound familiar? Schbibin Man 2?), but the hero here doesn't just use a gun - instead, his whole body is elastic, so you'll find yourself taking out enemies with extending legs, arms and even neck! Along the way, you'll pick up items from destroyed enemies and some weird floating thing that I'll not even begin to describe. And with a boss at the end of each level, a hero's work is never done. \n \n-http:\/\/www.pcengine.co.uk\/HTML_Games\/Berabo_Man.htm","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":650505600000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":650505600000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Aug-13","y":1990,"m":8}]}
