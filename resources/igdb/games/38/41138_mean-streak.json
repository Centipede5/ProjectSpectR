They have taken the abandoned orbital road and turned it into the Battletrack. You take your Mean Streak motorcycle and set out to dart through this dangerous Mad Max style world, with the aim of getting though these tough isometrically-viewed roads. You are armed, but so are the Outcasts you must face. \n \nHazards include walls, gaps in the road and oil slicks. A scanner at the bottom of the screen gives some advanced warning. You can pick up improved weaponry, extra fuel, and boxes of oil, which you can drop into the paths of onrushing bikes. As well as shooting other bikes, you can ram them into walls at the side of the road, or into the aforementioned hazards.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[34919,25311,28029,19341,68287,71455,23835,33644,54999,28465],"tags":[1,18,268435466,268435469,1073741826,1073741827],"developers":[11779],"publishers":[4119],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[10,13],"first_release_date":539136000000,"platforms":[15,26],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":539136000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Feb-01","y":1987,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dkw8ldglj5a0zb8mzygu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dkw8ldglj5a0zb8mzygu","width":800,"height":1069}}
