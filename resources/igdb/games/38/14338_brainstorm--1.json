There is a set of 54 cards flipped on their back so every card looks the same. On the flip-side, there are 26 pairs with different motives. The players (in turn) flip over two cards each while trying to find a pair. When a pair is found, it is removed from the table. The goal is to find more pairs than the opponent.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76731,9760,33603,36962,27266,55888,65827,36594,2015,32283],"tags":[268435465,268435471,268435480,536871327,536872929,536872991,1073741827],"developers":[12690],"publishers":[7190],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[415,2017,2079],"genres":[9,15,24],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":567907200000,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gomofkd6g7uibf6uycpm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gomofkd6g7uibf6uycpm","width":720,"height":568}}
