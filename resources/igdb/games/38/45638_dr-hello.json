{"id":45638,"name":"Dr. Hello","slug":"dr-hello","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/dr-hello","created_at":1499511729603,"updated_at":1516727182513,"summary":"Dr. Hello is an unlicensed Dr. Mario clone developed for the MSX and ported to the Sega Master System. It was developed in South Korea by a company known as \"Sis Co.\" in 1991, without the backing from either Sega or Nintendo. The game uses a completely different set of graphics and music to Dr. Mario, but the gameplay is exactly the same. \n \nDespite being released on a Master System cartridge, the Master System version runs in SG-1000 mode, and hence appears to have weaker graphics than most other Master System games. This is likely because the MSX and SG-1000 share similar specifications, and porting from one system to another was not too difficult.","popularity":1,"games":[25222,60044,14047,26223,27266,19222,8197,25646,236,54678],"tags":[268435465,536871140,536871701,536873787,536876258],"category":0,"keywords":[228,789,2875,5346],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":678326400000,"platforms":[64],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":64,"date":678326400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Jul-01","y":1991,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nxfylas71qesggmyyrsp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nxfylas71qesggmyyrsp","width":547,"height":761}}
