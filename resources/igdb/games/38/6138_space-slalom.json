The player controls a shuttle and must navigate it through a course defined by colored stars, similar to ski slaloms. The player must also avoid obstacles, and will be awarded with extra points depending on on his\/her speed across the course. \n \nAt a mere 8kB, the game is one of the smallest SG-1000 games, and was only sold in Japan.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[84],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":84,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30b9\u30e9\u30ed\u30fc\u30e0","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tulf4o2gxhb7dkltbve3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tulf4o2gxhb7dkltbve3","width":2790,"height":4000}}
