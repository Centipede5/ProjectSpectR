Through the advanced cloning technology, you are able to bring the real dinosaurs back to life, and what is more important, make a lots of money on tourism. The game is pretty similar to other Park management games with an impressive economy model, except it is a little more funny. You must buy an area of land in your park to house a dinosaur, you put fencing around it, so your dinosaur does not escape and then finally, you choose your own dinosaur to place in it. But be really sure not to place two enemies next to each other or even T-Rex next to something tasty, thing can turn up pretty nasty for you or your visitors.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55590,18623,19934,9199,23345,19376,55689,19847,19301],"tags":[28,34,268435469,268435471,536871291,536871446,536872060,536874694,536875870],"developers":[4046],"publishers":[1087],"category":0,"keywords":[379,534,1148,3782,4958],"themes":[28,34],"genres":[13,15],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[50,13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":50,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":13,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iy7gcupol9wmgbyiyrtz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iy7gcupol9wmgbyiyrtz","width":320,"height":200}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hwik2qdq50065sb6nbcb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hwik2qdq50065sb6nbcb","width":2415,"height":2989}}
