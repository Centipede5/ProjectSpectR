It was released in June 1983. In the game, the player to take on the role of the robot Bega (Vega) whose goal was to stop the invasion forces of the alien Varga (Genma), while also rescuing his three friends who had been kidnapped by them. Even among laserdisc games Bega's Battle has become somewhat rare because many of the machines were converted into Cobra Command machines as part of a discount deal offered by Data East in exchange for the internals of the Bega's Battle arcade cabinet. \n \nSimilar to Astron Belt, the game used the footage mainly for backgrounds, while the actual gameplay was a shooting game with sprites laid over the video. Bega's Battle also used brief full-motion video cut scenes to develop a story between the game's shooting stages. Years later, this would become the standard approach to video game storytelling. Bega's Battle also featured a branching storyline. The Twin Galaxies world record for Bega's Battle was set by Steve Harris (later the founder of Electronic Gaming Monthly) on July 18, 1983.","franchise":865,"franchises":[865],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25300,27314,11567,11156,68287,36950,21063,19561,19448,7349],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487,268435489,536870915,536870918,536870937,536870979,536870981,536870990,536871045,536871078,536871079,536871487,536871501,536871859,536871882,536871937,536871939,536871945,536871971,536872229,536872293,536872390,536872862,536873016,536873874,536874539,536874743,536875002,536875053,536875081,536875214,536875265,536875294,536875437,536875449,536875523,536875526,536875666,536875736,536875879,536876199,536876367,536876391,536876759,536876923,536878217,536880072,536880223,536880371,536880607,536880754,1073741826],"publishers":[2678],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3,6,25,67,69,78,133,166,167,575,589,947,970,1025,1027,1033,1059,1317,1381,1478,1950,2104,2962,3627,3831,4090,4141,4169,4302,4353,4382,4525,4537,4611,4614,4754,4824,4967,5287,5455,5479,5847,6011,7305,9160,9311,9459,9695,9842],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,31,33],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v6ykzarvoan1cbjm9o5j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v6ykzarvoan1cbjm9o5j","width":1000,"height":1298}}
