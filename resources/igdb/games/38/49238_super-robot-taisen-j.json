Notable for its battle animations, which are arguably on the level of the Playstation 2 versions of the series. \n \nThis game is notable for being the only anime-based SRW to not feature the Getter Robo franchise, the first of only two anime-based games to not feature series from Gundam's Universal Century timelime, and the first to include a battle-armor series (which technically isn't robot anime).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":1129334400000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1129334400000,"region":8,"human":"2005-Oct-15","y":2005,"m":10}]}
