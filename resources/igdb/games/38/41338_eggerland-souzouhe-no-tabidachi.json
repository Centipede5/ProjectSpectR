The storyline isn't really known since there is no storyline in the game. All you see is Lolo, the main character walk into a castle, and the doors shut behind him. There are 50 rounds in the game, which is less than the other Eggerland Famicom games. The game is unique out of all the other Eggerland titles for Famicom by allowing the player to create their own levels. \n \nLike the other Eggerland games, the objective of each stage is simple; collect all the heart frames and then collect the orb inside the treasure box to proceed to the next level. It won't be easy though; King Egger has sent forth his enemies to take care of you. Lolo must use certain tactics to get by, such as trapping the enemies or knocking them off the screen temporarily.","collection":1017,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[20342,20329,60044,79080,24426,27092,55173,34269,25311,56033],"tags":[1,268435465,268435471,536871570,536871599,536872407,536873787,536874694,536875639,536875666,536875758,536876930,536879712,536880771,536880772,536880796,1073741827],"developers":[762],"publishers":[762],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[658,687,1495,2875,3782,4727,4754,4846,6018,8800,9859,9860,9884],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":588038400000,"platforms":[51],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":588038400000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Aug-20","y":1988,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Eggerland: S\u014dz\u014d e no Tabidachi"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zf6llozd9roomxnme3c5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zf6llozd9roomxnme3c5","width":1000,"height":1126}}
