Players use double-chained blades, swords, hammers, and other weapons to hack and slash at enemies (e.g., zombie-like soldiers, snake creatures, giant insect-statues, monsters from Greek mythology). Combat is frenetic, and blood-splatter effects occur frequently; violent depictions include characters getting stabbed, ripped apart, and sliced in half. Some attacks result in enemies' entrails spilling out. During boss battles, players engage in close-up, extended combat, which is completed by a sequence of prompted button presses; these scenes also include depictions of decapitation and dismemberment. The game includes some suggestive\/sexual material: female enemies are sometimes depicted topless; one sequence depicts topless women caressing each other, while addressing the central character (e.g., \u201cGlory to Eros, he has given us a champion. . .come champion, show me your strength\u201d).","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/godofwar.playstation.com"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
