Star Citizen will consist of two main components: first person space combat and trading in a massively multiplayer persistent universe and customizable private servers (known as Star Citizen), and a branching single-player and drop-in co-operative multiplayer campaign (known as Squadron 42). The game will feature Oculus Rift support.","storyline":"The hum of the fusion drive reverberates through the ship's hull. It reminds you that you should probably replace it soon. A quick check on the MobiGlas says there's an Aegis showroom on the planet you're heading to. Couldn't hurt to see what they got, right? \n \nWith the Credits you make delivering this cargo, you should be able to buy your ship a little treat. Besides, she's your bread and butter. You roll on your side and look out the window at the vast yawning space outside. A distant planet silently orbits a dying sun.","hypes":286,"popularity":48.66666666666666,"games":[25311,55038,36950,2955,19249,19301,25300,17130,26145,17548],"tags":[1,18,39,268435461,268435468,268435469,268435487,268435488,536870915,536870935,536870936,536870982,536871009,536871338,536871365,536871475,536871859,536871882,536871970,536872060,536872552,536874136,536875151,536875807,536875819,536875869,536876218,536876235,536876239,536876730,536877077,536877151,536878046,536878099,536879703,536880775,1073741825],"developers":[873],"publishers":[873],"game_engines":[421],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[3,23,24,70,97,426,453,563,947,970,1058,1148,1640,3224,4239,4895,4907,4957,5306,5323,5327,5818,6165,6239,7134,7187,8791,9863],"themes":[1,18,39],"genres":[5,12,13,31,32],"first_release_date":1577750400000,"status":2,"pulse_count":248,"platforms":[6,3],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":3,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nnj43ut1aka3pjnyp8yz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nnj43ut1aka3pjnyp8yz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qqf2gx75efje21creiq4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qqf2gx75efje21creiq4","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k7jvxhaqsrtulyg8nxu3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k7jvxhaqsrtulyg8nxu3","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aaybeql0l1soiqwm8os8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aaybeql0l1soiqwm8os8","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iqvmvt2c7gxjzgk2iqva.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iqvmvt2c7gxjzgk2iqva","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Jz3Ch2VCupI"},{"name":"Squadron 42 Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"-5nkZTgo8d4"},{"name":"RSI Constellation Trailer","video_id":"J5mln7Gs09Q"},{"name":"Pupil to Planet Trailer","video_id":"b3WiebAKuSI"},{"name":"Admiral Bishop's Senate Speech","video_id":"7vuQsbST_ik"},{"name":"M50 Ship Commercial","video_id":"RvXgEBTODTc"},{"name":"Drake Cutlass Commercial","video_id":"F-f94S4AyMc"},{"name":"Consolidated Outland Mustang Commercial","video_id":"H-JAjtULd1Q"},{"name":"Squadron 42: Meet the Old Man","video_id":"BatXIVPQ50k"},{"name":"Alpha 2.0 Trailer","video_id":"41Zv0yaw7LM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q7zgwvwtthyvig9oiwpo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q7zgwvwtthyvig9oiwpo","width":853,"height":1024},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.robertsspaceindustries.com\/star-citizen\/"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/starcitizen.wikia.com\/wiki\/Main_Page"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/RobertsSpaceIndustries"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RobertsSpaceInd"}]}
