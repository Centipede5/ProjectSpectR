The Game builds upon cooperatively focused gameplay and Valve's proprietary Source engine, the same game engine used in the original Left 4 Dead. Set during the aftermath of an apocalyptic pandemic, Left 4 Dead 2 focuses on four new Survivors, fighting against hordes of the Infected, who develop severe psychosis and exhibit zombie-like tendencies. The Survivors must fight their way through five campaigns, interspersed with safe houses that act as checkpoints, with the goal of escape at each campaign's finale.","collection":26,"hypes":1,"rating":82.27767912652399,"popularity":9,"aggregated_rating":88.6,"aggregated_rating_count":7,"total_rating":85.438839563262,"total_rating_count":329,"rating_count":322,"games":[19686,26658,7631,37016,7291,13210,44076,26192,19561,102584],"tags":[1,19,21,268435461,536870917,536871365,536871900,536872032,536872229,536872983,536875610,536875830,536875856,536876075,536876125,536876545,536876838,536877049,536877113,536877297,536877498,536877644,536877670,536877938,536881102,536884120,1073741825],"developers":[56,55],"publishers":[56],"game_engines":[3],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":45000,"normally":90000,"completely":381600},"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[5,453,988,1120,1317,2071,4698,4918,4944,5163,5213,5633,5926,6137,6201,6385,6586,6732,6758,7026,10190,13208],"themes":[1,19,21],"genres":[5],"dlcs":[20416,22890,22889],"first_release_date":1258416000000,"pulse_count":8,"platforms":[6,14,12,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1258416000000,"human":"2009-Nov-17","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1258416000000,"human":"2009-Nov-17","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1283644800000,"human":"2010-Sep-05","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1372723200000,"human":"2013-Jul-02","y":2013,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"L4D2","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wdrlle5g5f7owsbevaix.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdrlle5g5f7owsbevaix","width":1728,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ushaltkbqtcooswfckwh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ushaltkbqtcooswfckwh","width":1728,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/scrnjjf7pyzrvktfifzg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"scrnjjf7pyzrvktfifzg","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rj3csep68w7cjwv5129q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rj3csep68w7cjwv5129q","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bmnylmpuwm3rlzmed90q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bmnylmpuwm3rlzmed90q","width":1728,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Cinematic","video_id":"9XIle_kLHKU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eckumjvspgvgsap4wmp2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eckumjvspgvgsap4wmp2","width":258,"height":349},"esrb":{"synopsis":"Infected zombie-like creatures roam the bayous, backwoods, streets, and parishes of a distinctly  Southern  United States in this first-person shooter set in the aftermath of apocalyptic pandemic. Groups of one-to-four players (i.e., the \"Survivors\") work cooperatively to battle the \"Infected\" zombies and reach safehouses at the end of each round\/chapter. Player-Survivors use realistic pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and assault rifles to kill hordes of zombies throughout the game; chainsaws, machetes, axes, and baseball bats can be used in frenetic close-quarter combat (i.e., melee attacks). In most cases, large sprays of blood shoot out of injured zombies, and they can stain the ground, walls\u2014players' screen; for example, the \"Boomer\"-Infected explode in a shower of blood and bile when shot, which clouds players' view of the impending zombie swarm.   Bladed melee weapons and direct hits from rifles, shotguns, etc., cause decapitation or dismemberment; intense depictions include: piles of the Infected in a pool of blood along the roadside; intestines spilling out of abdominal wounds; zombie gibs shooting in all directions; charred innards; and skeletal bits and unclaimed torsos. While the litany of somewhat \"gruesome\" depictions attests to the Mature rating, the over-the-top onslaught is, in some ways,  mitigated  by the exaggerated menacing evil (camp?) of the drone-like zombie horde; the genre homage (horror, zombies, . . .  cricket paddle ) is palpable. Consumers might alsowish to know that the game includes profanity, such as \"sh*t,\"\"a*shole,\" and \"b*tch\"; however, it is the  intense violence , the  blood and gore  that are the primary factors for the Mature rating.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.l4d.com"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Left_4_Dead_2"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/550"}],"external":{"steam":"550"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
