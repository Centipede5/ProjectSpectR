From a third-person perspective, players observe character interactions, and can make dialogue choices that affect the outcome of the story.

In one sequence, a character is seen getting struck and killed by a car; in another scene, a bound character is injected with heroin against her will. Injured characters are sometimes depicted with blood on their hands and clothing; a handful of scenes contain large streaks of blood. Dialogue and game text occasionally reference sexual material (e.g., \u201cwill bang 4 Jesus\u201d; \u201cWait, you're a prostitute? But I'm a prostitute! Now who gets paid?\u201d; \u201cYou just looked at my t*ts\u201d). During the course of the game, a character is shown smoking marijuana; a couple of sequences depict high-school students drinking alcohol.
