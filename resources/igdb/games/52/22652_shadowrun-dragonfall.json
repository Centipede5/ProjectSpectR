The Flux-State: a stable anarchy enforced by an ever-shifting coalition of megacorps, political factions, and savvy power players. A place where almost anything goes and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. Dangerous jobs abound and there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday \u2013 provided you live long enough to spend it. For you and your team of battle-scarred runners, it\u2019s just another day in the Free City of Berlin. \n \nBut a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. The only clue: whispers of the DRAGONFALL, a long-forgotten event from the earliest days of the Awakened world. As you find yourself drawn into a maze of veiled dangers and strange machinations, you will come face-to-face with a grim spectre of the past\u2026 and alter the course of Berlin\u2019s future.","storyline":"In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. \n \nIt\u2019s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge\u2019s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \u201cFlux State\u201d controls the city of Berlin. It\u2019s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there\u2019s no better place to earn a quick payday. \n \nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return.","collection":554,"franchise":127,"franchises":[127],"rating":82.0906148357394,"popularity":4.666666666666666,"aggregated_rating":82.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":82.29530741786971,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":7,"game":3020,"games":[25311,55038,103282,81249,54775,103294,26879,25623,76397,90099],"tags":[1,17,18,268435468,268435471,536871008,536871015,536871244,536872191,536872553,536874612,536878467,536887982,536887983,536887984,1073741827],"developers":[1419],"publishers":[1419],"game_engines":[13],"category":4,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[96,103,332,1279,1641,3700,7555,17070,17071,17072],"themes":[1,17,18],"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":1393459200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[34,6,39,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":14,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":39,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":34,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":3,"human":"TBD"},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1393459200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Feb-27","y":2014,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e5t3ygww2ian3zx7irda.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e5t3ygww2ian3zx7irda","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qkp8zqgmilhveam95ude.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qkp8zqgmilhveam95ude","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pgcvnbp1i2ynhsfkhstk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pgcvnbp1i2ynhsfkhstk","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zeogwkme8qa87nrjikcg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zeogwkme8qa87nrjikcg","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ohdenwj7jz1vniojrilr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ohdenwj7jz1vniojrilr","width":480,"height":270}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"yFsDIXEJ5RQ"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"pu2hyqDVOhA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ltgdatpihklbdloawpat.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ltgdatpihklbdloawpat","width":1200,"height":1600},"websites":[{"category":14,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/shadowrunreturns"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/300550\/Shadowrun_Dragonfall__Directors_Cut"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCO0pndgsIKZdyf9qFmhmSSw"},{"category":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/directory\/game\/Shadowrun%3A%20Dragonfall%20-%20Director's%20Cut"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WeBeHarebrained"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Shadowrun-Dragonfall-438470232953630"},{"category":2,"url":"https:\/\/shadowrun.gamepedia.com\/Shadowrun:_Dragonfall"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/harebrained-schemes.com\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shadowrun:_Dragonfall"}]}
