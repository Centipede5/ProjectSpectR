It draws on Irem's R-Type and Konami's other shoot 'em up Gradius, while adding the tentacle mechanics of Irem's other shoot 'em up XMultiply. \nThe game is notable for different gameplay mechanics between the original Japanese release and the overseas releases. \nThe gameplay is similar to R-Type and X-Multiply. The player's ship, the Flintlock, has a detachable orb attachment called the Flint, which behaves similar to R-Type's Force Device. Powerups can be obtained in the Japanese version to increase the Flint's power, movement speed, change the main weapon, or even give the player an extra life. \nThe overseas versions introduce a variety of changes, with the most notable being the removal of all but one upgradable weapon. The enemy patterns are also changed slightly. \nIn the game, players pilot a ship called the Flintlock in order to save a blue haired princess named Irene of the planet E-Square from an evil lord named Klaus. Each stage is punctuated with a cutscene of the princess crying for help as she is tortured. In the ending, the Flintlock sends the orb back through the atmosphere of the planet, where it morphs into a naked fairy.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,32902,10039,68287,68142,10209,28751,41218],"tags":[1,268435461,536871078,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[166],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":672969600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":672969600000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Apr-30","y":1991,"m":4},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ek3ngnwwqmelrh6asqf4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ek3ngnwwqmelrh6asqf4","width":340,"height":479}}
