Even though the game doesn't carry an NBA license, 27 of the teams are based on the cities of their real professional counterparts of that era. The other team is an all star team. \n \nThe game has an exhibition and playoff mode. Exhibition is the usual team vs team game, while the playoff mode has 8 teams competing to win the championship. Players can choose to turn fouls on or off and also choose how many minutes each quarter will be. \n \nThe game features a vertical basketball court, with only half of the court shown at any one time. When a player takes the ball from one side of the court to the other, the screen rotates and then the other half of the court is shown. \n \nEarvin \"Magic\" Johnson gives commentary before a game, while broadcaster Chick Hearn gives the play by play during the game.","popularity":1,"games":[46533,22690,48266,80135,80049,64085,63247,58315,48991,43824],"tags":[268435470,536870970,536872078,536875139],"category":0,"keywords":[58,1166,4227],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Magic Johnson no Super Slam Dunk","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Magic Johnson's Super Slam Dunk","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ragj1yfmyqgg7h0mpf5j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ragj1yfmyqgg7h0mpf5j","width":150,"height":103}}
