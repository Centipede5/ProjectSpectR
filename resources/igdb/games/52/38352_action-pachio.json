In between each level is a cut scene that updates the story for the player. Players can collect coins in the game; collecting 100 of them results in an extra life. They are also given a life bar with three different colors (symbolizing how \"healthy\" the character is), a time limit, and a relatively generic score indicator that goes up to 99 million points.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":736905600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":736905600000,"region":8,"human":"1993-May-09","y":1993,"m":5}]}
