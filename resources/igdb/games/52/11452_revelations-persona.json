Players traverse through dungeons, negotiate with enemies, and enter turn-based battles with an assortment of demons, zombies, spirits, and slimes. Players can use conventional weapons (e.g., swords, spears, and firearms) or summon demons called 'Personas' to perform magic spells against enemies. There are a number of demons\/characters in the game that appear sexually suggestive: A silver-skinned demon's breasts are exposed; a phallic-shaped demon bursts out of a character's stomach; butterfly and spider creatures briefly expose portions of their buttocks. In one sequence, a character attempts to seduce another person by saying, 'Oooh, my chest is sore . . . Maybe if you gave it a little rub . . .' During the course of the game, players can enter a casino and wager virtual money on games of video Blackjack, slots, and poker. Profanity (e.g., 'sh*t,' 'a*shole,' and 'd*ckweed') occasionally appears in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - - Content that teaches or encourages gambling","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.atlus.com\/persona\/"}]}
