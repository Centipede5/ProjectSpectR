Honestly \u2013 which side is the true one? We wake up in our beds, but is it possible to remember second awakening? You remember well what you have done in your dream, what happend, who was there and what was your goal or desire. Yes, but WHEN you have woke up? When you have crossed the barrier? How you have entered that world and why it often ends in some sort of tragedy, that pushes you out? The only thing that left are memories of dream.
