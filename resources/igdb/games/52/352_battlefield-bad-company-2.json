Both modes involve using machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and rockets to kill enemy soldiers on the battlefield. In single-player mode, players conduct missions on an unnamed Japanese island during World War II and then move into the modern day through jungles, deserts, and snowy terrain. The firefights contain realistic gunfire, loud explosions, cries of pain; large sprays of blood come out of injured characters during the fast-paced combat. There are also close-up depictions of knife-stabbing (flesh-impact sounds) and melee attacks with a power drill. Multiplayer mode tends to involve more goal-oriented tasks, such as 'capturing-the-flag,' destroying and defending crates, point-based fighting. Characters use profanity (e.g., 'f**k,' 'sh*t,' and 'a*shole') during cutscenes and in the heat of battle.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/battlefieldbadcompany2.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/24960"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/Battlefield"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/battlefield"},{"category":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/battlefield"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Battlefield"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/battlefield"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battlefield:_Bad_Company_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/battlefield.wikia.com\/wiki\/Battlefield:_Bad_Company_2"}],"external":{"steam":"24960"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
