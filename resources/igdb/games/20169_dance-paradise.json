Players follow the dance moves of a stylized on-screen figure, as music video clips play and other characters get down in the background. The Kinect camera add-on detects players' whole-body motions, and the software computes the accuracy of their movements to the beat of the current song. In addition to the follow-the-leader single-player challenges, a \"Freestyle\" mode allows players to express themselves with their own custom moves, and multiplayer modes let two dancers go head-to-head. The game's soundtrack includes a variety of 40 popular songs, with contemporary and classic dance hits from artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Gwen Stefani, Kool & the Gang, Lady Gaga, Lil Wayne, and others. Routines were developed with professional dancers.","rating":70,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":40,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":55,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":0,"games":[37067,50667,25217,50733,66659,64466,50930,14982,19936,16513],"tags":[268435463,536872205,536872611,536873064,536875049,536875140,536876260,536878193,536882120],"category":0,"keywords":[1293,1699,2152,4137,4228,5348,7281,11208],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1300147200000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1300147200000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Mar-15","y":2011,"m":3}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vvttswsayyzu6uuidiux.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vvttswsayyzu6uuidiux","width":581,"height":363}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qeejpi6gdgcxsxryjpew.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qeejpi6gdgcxsxryjpew","width":430,"height":517},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3}}
