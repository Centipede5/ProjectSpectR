It was released in Europe on April 30, 2010,[3] and in North America on May 4.[4] Published by Sega, the game was developed by Sega Studios San Francisco for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Nintendo DS, by High Voltage Software for Wii & PlayStation Portable,[1] and by Gameloft for iOS (released on May 3[5]) and BlackBerry PlayBook (released on August 25[6]). A Microsoft Windows version was planned, but was cancelled.[7] \n \nThe game has an original story written by The Invincible Iron Man scribe Matt Fraction.[8] This story is set after the plot of the film, although the iOS and BlackBerry versions stick roughly to the film's plot. The game features the voices of Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson, reprising their roles from the film. Lamb of God recorded an exclusive song for the game, \"Hit the Wall\".","collection":3147,"franchise":320,"franchises":[320],"rating":70,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":41.1,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":55.55,"total_rating_count":14,"rating_count":3,"games":[36950,19565,17447,14763,68287,7350,27208,14760,4935,5181],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487,536870926,536870933,536871580,536871706,536871937,536872205,536872745,536873299,536873810,536874452,536875046,536875054,536875081,536875157,536875199,536875257,536875294,536875456,536875688,536875717,536875736,536876296,536876901,536876964,536877263,536877275,536877402,536877775,536877957,536878201,536878245,536878257,536878323,536880583,536883347,536885236,536885854,536893036,536893037,1073741826],"developers":[61,2208,392],"publishers":[112,61],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,21,668,794,1025,1293,1833,2387,2898,3540,4134,4142,4169,4245,4287,4345,4382,4544,4776,4805,4824,5384,5989,6052,6351,6363,6490,6863,7045,7289,7333,7345,7411,9671,12435,14324,14942,22124,22125],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":1272585600000,"platforms":[39,73,9,38,12,20,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1272585600000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1272931200000,"region":2,"human":"2010-May-04","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1272585600000,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1272585600000,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1272585600000,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1272585600000,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1272585600000,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1272844800000,"human":"2010-May-03","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":73,"date":1282694400000,"human":"2010-Aug-25","y":2010,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Iron Man 2 for iPad LITE","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Iron Man 2 for iPad","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Iron Man 2 LITE","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x2xhsceopldf3fmsuhlk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x2xhsceopldf3fmsuhlk","width":550,"height":309}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nph5gjvplukarue5cih9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nph5gjvplukarue5cih9","width":250,"height":311},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
