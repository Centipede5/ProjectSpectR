Players can proceed through the game as a street racer or a police cruiser; the storyline follows the rivalry between the two groups. As racers, players must flee from the police and can deliberately crash into police cruisers or other racers. In addition to crashing into racers, police cruisers can use various tools\/weapons to thwart racers' progress: spike strips, electric\/electromagnetic mines or shockwave devices, and a \u201cshock ram\u201d that hits cars with a burst of compressed air. Collisions are often accompanied by slow-motion effects and crashing sounds.","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Need_for_Speed_Rivals"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/nfs.wikia.com\/wiki\/Need_for_Speed:_Rivals"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.needforspeed.com"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":6,"offlinemax":0}]}
