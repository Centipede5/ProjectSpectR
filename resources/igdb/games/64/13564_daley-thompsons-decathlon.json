Success in the 1500 Meters event results in the game returning to Day 1 to repeat the events with more difficult qualification criteria. \n \nRunning is simulated by hitting two keys (representing the left and right leg) alternately and as quickly as possible. The game rapidly gained a reputation amongst players as a \"joystick killer\" because of the constant vigorous waggling of the joystick required during many of the events.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[15851,102805,22690,30830,103377,103218,24198,106814,100359,12340],"tags":[268435470,536871538,536872078,536872862,536875364,536875942,536876199,536877431,536880243,536885035,1073741828],"developers":[1271],"publishers":[1271],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[626,1166,1950,4452,5030,5287,6519,9331,14123],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":473299200000,"region":1,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f1w2wpj89amxxm9ovtym.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f1w2wpj89amxxm9ovtym","width":1000,"height":1497},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Daley_Thompson%27s_Decathlon"}]}
