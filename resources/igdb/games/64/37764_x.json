Its Game Boy version was called one of the four most influential Game Boy games ever created, as it was the first 3D game for a portable system. It was released by drx on September 17, 2006. \n3D performances weren't good enough on a stock SNES so Nintendo accepted to invest a million into the creation of the Super FX chip. \nStar Fox was then developed and became the first polygonal-based console game to sell many million units. \nThe rest is history.","collection":4638,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,142,25300,71455,27523,11253],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871859,536871882,536871937,536872733,536875262,536875271,536875472,536877102],"category":0,"keywords":[947,970,1025,1821,4350,4359,4560,6190,16756],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"pulse_count":1,"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ekkusu","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wdiqyiewyoog7rm1jfsf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wdiqyiewyoog7rm1jfsf","width":620,"height":876}}
