Learn to analyze and predict how the game will unfold to achieve the most points and successful completion. Welcome to the peaceful world of SameGame and the tense world of Robots. Either choice is an addicting path. \n \nSAMEGAME - There are three different pieces on the board. Connect as many shapes of one type to score higher points and clear the board. The two variations of the game only have different game rules. \n \nROBOTS - Move the cursor to destroy all the Robots on the screen by making them collide into each other, by making them hit their left over scrap, or by using a bomb.","popularity":1,"games":[60044,34218,32728,27266,47961,47806,41435,48248,41292,3892],"tags":[34,268435465,536871446,536871736,536872216,536872407,536872475,536872529,536875071,536877609],"category":0,"keywords":[534,824,1304,1495,1563,1617,4159,6697],"themes":[34],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1075593600000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":1075593600000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Feb-01","y":2004,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ptz3mdnr2cfdfbzisvfh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ptz3mdnr2cfdfbzisvfh","width":342,"height":342}}
