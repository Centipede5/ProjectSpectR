It is a one-on-one version of the game, rather than the standard four-player board game arrangement, and it incorporates many of the various and byzantine scoring rules of the game. \n \nIrem developed and published the game but left a mysterious licensing credit to Ox Inc. on the title screen. It's possible the game is a port of an obscure Japanese Mahjong computer game, or at least borrows some of its coding for the AI opponent or scoring systems.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11588,25217,42251,37814,37804,19083,48754,37939,37935,37803],"tags":[268435470,268435482,536871923,536873513,536875051,536877023],"category":0,"keywords":[1011,2601,4139,6111],"genres":[14,26],"first_release_date":557712000000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":557712000000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Sep-04","y":1987,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fosscqwqxgirij8t4zq5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fosscqwqxgirij8t4zq5","width":250,"height":278}}
