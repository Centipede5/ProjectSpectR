Her plans and her whereabouts have remained a mystery... until now. But whether you seek answers, revenge, or reconciliation with your lost love, you may find more than you bargained for.","storyline":"The dreaded Archdemon has been slain and the advance of the darkspawn halted by a lone, heroic Grey Warden. The kingdom rejoices, but at least one question remains: what happened to Morrigan? The sorceress joined the Wardens' cause, but it is said her true purpose was not revealed until the eve of the last battle. She vanished into the shadows, and while rumors claimed she crossed over the mountains into Orlais no trace of her path could be found. She was never heard from again... until now. Nearly a year has passed since the Archdemon's death, and word has reached the Wardens that Morrigan has returned to Ferelden. She has been sighted in the southern wilderness where she was first encountered. Is it truly her? If it is, then why is she here and what secret does she carry with her? The Warden heads into the forest to find out and tie up this last loose end once and for all.","collection":10,"rating":69.894459979538,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":69.894459979538,"total_rating_count":19,"rating_count":19,"game":76,"games":[81249,106987,101608,103282,25877,54775,78632,55038,1221,26879],"tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536871453,1073741826],"developers":[2],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[75],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[541],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1283817600000,"platforms":[6,14,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1283817600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Sep-07","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1283817600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Sep-07","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1283817600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Sep-07","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1283817600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Sep-07","y":2010,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xoegyolmtue6lwl8uw2r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xoegyolmtue6lwl8uw2r","width":862,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gze4fkdfxilvvdvbyjfl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gze4fkdfxilvvdvbyjfl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rgpo6mwghth3mc1lot0r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rgpo6mwghth3mc1lot0r","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"pk3HuuDCABk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d10tafh0wetsdislek50.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d10tafh0wetsdislek50","width":262,"height":374},"esrb":{"synopsis":"-","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/dragonage.wikia.com\/wiki\/Witch_Hunt"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/dragonage.bioware.com\/dao\/witch_hunt\/"}]}
