We decided to bring these passions together to make a game that would resonate with fellow fans of the genre, as well as to push the envelope in fun and exciting way","storyline":"At the heart of an evil empire, a group of young outsiders rebel against the corrupt system that holds them down. \n \nProfessional thieves on the trail of an ancient relic, the group infiltrates the glittering halls of a corrupt noble\u2019s private chambers in pursuit of their target, narrowly escaping the wrath of the city guards at every turn. Desperate to find an escape, they seek refuge in the city\u2019s seamy slums and brave the sunless pits of the underworld. Out to get them are heavily armed city guards, rival gangs and psychotic families of subterranean cannibals. Abandoned by the system and used by selfish criminals, these young companions will be forced to come to terms with their own reality. But be warned - in the world of Children of Zodiarcs, no one escapes unscathed!","hypes":1,"rating":50,"popularity":4,"aggregated_rating":78.8,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":64.4,"total_rating_count":6,"rating_count":1,"games":[22387,36198,23733,26845,20331,28182,55092,7615,22747,26553],"tags":[17,39,268435468,268435471,268435480,268435488,536871029,536871208,536871338,536871938,536872460,536872843,536872992,536873405,536874083,536874694,536875046,536875066,536875136,536875783,536879939,1073741827],"developers":[12233],"publishers":[9385,12233],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[117,296,426,1026,1548,1931,2080,2493,3171,3782,4134,4154,4224,4871,9027],"themes":[17,39],"genres":[12,15,24,32],"first_release_date":1500336000000,"pulse_count":6,"platforms":[6,14,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1500336000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jul-18","y":2017,"m":7},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1514678400000,"region":8,"human":"2017","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1500336000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jul-18","y":2017,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"War of Zodiarcs","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e9lfesbvxdagar4xna0n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e9lfesbvxdagar4xna0n","width":1920,"height":1064},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ntu3zvzao5yeq4eux8re.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ntu3zvzao5yeq4eux8re","width":1920,"height":1078},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jsmplxmqtlxdtufptyuv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jsmplxmqtlxdtufptyuv","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nlcmzacma2udpbwwcsrj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nlcmzacma2udpbwwcsrj","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nfnkibznqpabv3aftbpn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nfnkibznqpabv3aftbpn","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Y6c18mgFfMA"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"MXHpLP5WeE4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vrwxcwgvlzelu5p3vj3s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vrwxcwgvlzelu5p3vj3s","width":616,"height":353},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CardboardUtopia"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/436290"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.cardboard-utopia.com\/children-of-zodiarcs\/"}],"external":{"steam":"436290"}}
