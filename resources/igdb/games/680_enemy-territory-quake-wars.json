It is the second multiplayer-focused game in the Quake series after Quake III Arena. \n \nQuake Wars features similar gameplay to Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, but with the addition of controllable vehicles and aircraft as well as multiple AI deployables,[13] asymmetric teams, much larger maps and the option of computer-controlled bot opponents. Unlike the previous Enemy Territory games, Quake Wars is a commercial release rather than a free download. \n \nEnemy Territory: Quake Wars received mostly positive reviews upon release, although it received some criticism on consoles.","collection":37,"rating":64.2136945522424,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":81,"aggregated_rating_count":7,"total_rating":72.6068472761212,"total_rating_count":15,"rating_count":8,"games":[26401,28204,355,286,622,621,1310,7351,277,240],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435471,536870915,536870930,536871041,536871079,536871365,536871378,536871470,536871835,536871882,536871937,536872019,536872070,536872205,536872245,536873122,536873455,536874694,536874743,536874900,536874947,536875046,536875073,536875133,536875157,536875173,536875242,536875271,536875303,536875309,536875358,536875492,536875572,536875609,536875624,536875802,536875804,536875830,536875941,536876018,536876221,536876235,536876262,536876367,536876391,536876435,536876521,536876565,536876586,536876603,536876687,536876762,536876851,536876857,536876871,536876948,536877049,536877208,536877210,536877211,536877212,536877217,536877220,536877227,536877231,536877433,536877498,536877799,536877810,536877820,536877933,536877938,536877953,536877961,536878002,536878104,536878317,536878582,536879705,536879870,536880134,536880210,536880294,536880442,536880901,536880960,536881372,536881514,536881515,536881525,536881529,536881542,536881702,536881831,536881938,536883035,536883995,536884018,536884021,536884125,536884916,536886166,1073741825],"developers":[221],"publishers":[66,73,184],"game_engines":[48],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[3,18,129,167,453,466,558,923,970,1025,1107,1158,1293,1333,2210,2543,3782,3831,3988,4035,4134,4161,4221,4245,4261,4330,4359,4391,4397,4446,4580,4660,4697,4712,4890,4892,4918,5029,5106,5309,5323,5350,5455,5479,5523,5609,5653,5674,5691,5775,5850,5939,5945,5959,6036,6137,6296,6298,6299,6300,6305,6308,6315,6319,6521,6586,6887,6898,6908,7021,7026,7041,7049,7090,7192,7405,7670,8793,8958,9222,9298,9382,9530,9989,10048,10460,10602,10603,10613,10617,10630,10790,10919,11026,12123,13083,13106,13109,13213,14004,15254],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,15],"first_release_date":1190937600000,"platforms":[6,14,9,12,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1214438400000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Jun-26","y":2008,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1212105600000,"region":1,"human":"2008-May-30","y":2008,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1211846400000,"region":2,"human":"2008-May-27","y":2008,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1205798400000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Mar-18","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1211846400000,"region":2,"human":"2008-May-27","y":2008,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1191283200000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Oct-02","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1192752000000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Oct-19","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1190937600000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Sep-28","y":2007,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1208995200000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Apr-24","y":2008,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1212105600000,"region":1,"human":"2008-May-30","y":2008,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1212710400000,"region":3,"human":"2008-Jun-06","y":2008,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1212710400000,"region":3,"human":"2008-Jun-06","y":2008,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1190937600000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Sep-28","y":2007,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1191888000000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Oct-09","y":2007,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"ET:
