Players encounter several irreverent characters that make jokes about being too big to fit into a hole (e.g., \"That's what she said.\"); zombies with nipple rings; sexual harassment posters (e.g., \"I've touched all of those places\"); drugs at raves; and seducing women to conceive \"hellspawn.\" Cutscenes also contain bathroom humor, including a depiction of a character that urinates a stream of fire at the heroes. Characters sometimes use the expletives \"a*s\" and \"bastard,\" as well as other profanities that are beeped out\/censored. During one episode, players must win a boxing mini-game against rats inside a robot. Another episode depicts Sam shooting a pistol at characters and Max chewing on a man's forehead","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.telltalegames.com\/store\/samandmax-season2"}]}
