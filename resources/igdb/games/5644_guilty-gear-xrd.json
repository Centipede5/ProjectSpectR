The fifth installment in the Guilty Gear series, Guilty Gear Xrd was developed using Unreal Engine 3, with cel-shaded graphics in place of the series traditional hand drawn sprites. Following the storyline of the last game in the series, Guilty Gear 2: Overture, it introduced four new characters. \n \nThe first Xrd game, Guilty Gear Xrd -Sign- was released in arcades on February 20, 2014, and for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in Japan and North America in December of the same year, with a digital-only release in Europe in June 2015, and to the PC via Valve Corporation's digital store, Steam, on December 10th, 2015. The game has been praised for its cel-shaded graphics and approachable gameplay, but criticized for its non-interactive story mode and smaller roster of characters. A sequel follow-up,[b] titled Guilty Gear Xrd -Revelator-, was announced for a Q2 2016 release on consoles.","collection":827,"hypes":1,"rating":89.3802489548101,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":89.3802489548101,"total_rating_count":8,"rating_count":8,"games":[22792,106859,28010,90101,76428,55038,28175,68441,76736,103294],"tags":[17,18,268435460,536870990,536871822,1073741828],"developers":[1218],"publishers":[2103],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[78,910],"themes":[17,18],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":1392854400000,"pulse_count":5,"platforms":[52,6,9,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1417651200000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Dec-04","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1417651200000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Dec-04","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1392854400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Feb-20","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1418688000000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Dec-16","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1418688000000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Dec-16","y":2014,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1449705600000,"human":"2015-Dec-10","y":2015,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30ae\u30eb\u30c6\u30a3\u30ae\u30a2 \u30a4\u30b0\u30b6\u30fc\u30c9","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nukuf2z8ziqorr6wcuow.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nukuf2z8ziqorr6wcuow","width":600,"height":338}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"NKGPhKu3jNg"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"M5pkaWp8Xso"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"gQ9Cd4MKqHs"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zn9ppwvhovmcszczqe9h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zn9ppwvhovmcszczqe9h","width":640,"height":798},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a fighting game in which players engage in one-on-one battles using human characters and biological weapons called GEARs. Players punch, kick, and use various weapons (e.g., swords, chain scythes, giant scalpels) to drain opponents' life meters. Characters can perform super attacks in which characters are attacked by fiery blasts, shot out of cannons, and electrocuted by lightning. Combat is accompanied by sword slashes, cries of pain, and large explosions. Cutscenes occasionally depict smears of blood on characters' bodies and faces; one sequence depicts a character lying in a pool of blood after being shot. The game includes some suggestive material: female characters wearing outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; camera angles that focus on breasts\/cleavage; dialogue that contains innuendo (e.g., \u201cThose hips\u2014uh, I mean, those lips\u2014no, I mean, that face! Yeah the face\u201d and \u201cThe gown that you wear, is difficult to pull off, in more than one way\u201d). During the course of the game, a character is frequently depicted smoking a pipe during matches. The word \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in dialogue.
