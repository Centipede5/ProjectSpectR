Players traverse an open-world environment, engage in infiltration, and use sniper rifles, machine guns, and pistols to kill human enemies. Players can also perform melee kills (e.g., knife stabs) to eliminate enemy soldiers discretely. Successful headshots trigger slow-motion tracking shots of the bullet as it hits the target; enemies' heads are sometimes depicted bursting into pieces. Blood is frequently depicted as enemies are shot, and some areas contain large bloodstains amid corpses. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a bound man stabbed in the hand during an interrogation; a man shot point blank in the head. Players also have the ability kills civilians with weapons and\/or run them over with vehicles, though these acts are not encouraged. The game contains references to sexual material: dialogue about prostitution (e.g., \u201cYou are a whore I paid for...\u201d and \u201cHey, sweetie, wanna play some dirty games?\u201d); a brothel with a pole dancer performing on stage; a woman pushing a man down as she kneels between his legs\u2014no sexual act is depicted, as the scene fades to black. Drugs are also referenced in the text and dialogue (e.g., \u201cMission: Opium War V\u201d; \u201cYou're f**king high\u201d; and \u201cTrading drugs for weapons sounds familiar, doesn't it?\u201d). The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201cas*hole\u201d are heard in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language - Realistic looking violence - - - Mild bad language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.sniperghostwarrior3.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/368070"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sniper_Ghost_Warrior_3"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/sniperghostwarrior.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sniper:_Ghost_Warrior_3"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/cityinteractive"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SniperTheGame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/SniperGhostWarrior"}],"external":{"steam":"368070"}}
