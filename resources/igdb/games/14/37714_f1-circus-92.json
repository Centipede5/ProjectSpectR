The last of the F1 Circus games to be released for the system. \n \nF1 Circus '92, sometimes known as F1 Circus '92: The Speed of Sound, is a racing game for the PC Engine and part of Nichibutsu's F1 Circus series. It is the fourth and last game in the series to be released on the PC Engine platform, and the seventh game in the series overall. Like its predecessors, it is officially licensed by the distributors of Formula One in Japan, and also has the rights to use the real names of teams\/drivers. \n \nThe game again focuses on top-down races that move at great speed and require a lot of memorization and careful driving. The player can easily be forced to retire from the race early if they take too much damage from collisions with the walls or other drivers. There's a strong customization element as well, and the player can choose to play a Special mode that includes dialogue with NPCs between races.","collection":3209,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[67625,58785,46103,40815,40470,44332,44328,42572,42268,40823],"tags":[268435466,268435470,536874337,536875069,536875117,536876749,536876786],"category":0,"keywords":[3425,4157,4205,5837,5874],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":724636800000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":724636800000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Dec-18","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":727315200000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Jan-18","y":1993,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mbkvl2sdj4cljq8zaykx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mbkvl2sdj4cljq8zaykx","width":400,"height":400}}
