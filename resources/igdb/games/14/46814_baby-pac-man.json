The cabinet consists of a 13-inch video screen seated above an elevated horizontal pinball game, and the combination fits into roughly the same size space as an upright arcade machine. \n \nThe development of Baby Pac-Man was not authorized by Namco. It was designed and released entirely by Bally-Midway (as were Pac-Man Plus, Jr. Pac-Man, and Professor Pac-Man), which eventually led to Namco canceling its relationship with Bally-Midway.[1] 7,000 units were produced.[","collection":2095,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[18381,7452,2750,50327,46813,7170,20900,60202,71475,25151],"tags":[1,268435486,536870928,536871846,536873064,536875074,536875076,536875096,536875118,536875119,536875120,536875236,536875396,536875397,536875403,536875404,536875412,536875517,536875607,536875637,536875661,536875662,536875666,536875691,536875870,536876087,536876120,536876354,536876435,536876658,536876713,536876716,536876718,536878562,536878581,536880046,536882542],"category":0,"keywords":[16,934,2152,4162,4164,4184,4206,4207,4208,4324,4484,4485,4491,4492,4500,4605,4695,4725,4749,4750,4754,4779,4958,5175,5208,5442,5523,5746,5801,5804,5806,7650,7669,9134,11630],"themes":[1],"genres":[30],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/orvvkbzfc3wunaz5emud.jpg","cloudinary_id":"orvvkbzfc3wunaz5emud","width":141,"height":320}}
