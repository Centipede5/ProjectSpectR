The game features Round Play, which you can use to practice the course in the game or compete with friends, or Tournament mode, where you play against a computer opponent in an effort to win a large amount of prize money. The game was also released for the Game Boy in 1991. The Game Boy version features a different course but is very similar in many respects. In 1996, that version was also included in the compilation title, Namco Gallery Vol. 1.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[48285,61416,57050,38163,4192,42498,35626,72194,63188,61239],"tags":[268435470,536870942,536871487,536875093,536875626,536875627],"category":0,"keywords":[30,575,4181,4714,4715],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":583372800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":583372800000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Jun-27","y":1988,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wb4iifjvonagsjwsdlek.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wb4iifjvonagsjwsdlek","width":279,"height":400}}
