Head back to early 1900's Tokyo as Oogami Ichirou, a naval commander who's now become the last line of defense against the demons that stalk the capital. The all-female cast from the original returns in full, joined by two additional members. The grid-based strategy battles from the original are improved with better spell attacks and cleaner graphics, while the \"LIPS\" interactive conversation sequences feature better production values, color depth and a few additional twists on interactivity.","collection":3679,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[53189,11362,86605,79134,9760,76397,33603,103232,33383,25491],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":891648000000,"platforms":[6,32,38,23],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1141862400000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Mar-09","y":2006,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":983404800000,"region":5,"human":"2001-Mar-01","y":2001,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":969494400000,"region":5,"human":"2000-Sep-21","y":2000,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":891648000000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Apr-04","y":1998,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/luxloexuw5xmvaxfkut4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"luxloexuw5xmvaxfkut4","width":800,"height":682},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sakura_Wars_2:_Thou_Shalt_Not_Die"}]}
