It was only available in Japan as a download through the Sega Game Toshokan service. \n \nPutter Golf is essentially (but whether or not it officially is is unknown) a Mega Drive version of Putt & Putter: a very simple golf game with an isometric perspective. Rather than compete on wide open courts however, the game opts for much smaller levels which would only require a putter (much like minigolf). As well as this, there are a number of obstacles which can get in your way, from bumpers to lava.","popularity":1,"games":[65232,26748,64736,63631,19376,76110,80386,77788,68059,67650],"tags":[268435470,536870942,536875046,536879971],"category":0,"keywords":[30,4134,9059],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rcr96fyprrttnsq3cgro.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rcr96fyprrttnsq3cgro","width":540,"height":406}}
