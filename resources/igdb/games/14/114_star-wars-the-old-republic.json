Several centuries ago, the greatest threat the galaxy has ever known emerged in the form of the dark Sith Empire. After a volatile war, the Republic emerged victorious and the Sith were assumed to be extinct. Nonetheless, the Jedi have maintained a constant vigil over the ancient Sith homeworld, Korriban, to protect the galaxy from the darkness that still resides in the planet's tombs. \n \nThough a small group of survivors escaped to warn of the Imperial invasion, it was only a minor reprieve for the Republic. Korriban was one of several worlds to fall in the initial onslaught, and in the years that followed, the Republic suffered many more painful defeats. Emboldened by their numerous victories, the Empire soon moved to conquer the Core Worlds, luring the Republic fleet out of position and launching a surprise attack against the noble world of Alderaan. \n \nThe courageous stand on Alderaan rallied the spirits of Republic defenders across the galaxy, but the balance of the power remained in the Empire's favor. This only fueled the surprise felt when the Imperial Dark Council extended the offer to the Republic to engage in peace negotiations. Suspecting possible treachery, Republic officials agreed to meet on Alderaan, but insisted that the Jedi Order marshal all its resources to provide comprehensive security. The Jedi complied, sending most senior members of the Order to Alderaan, and leaving only a token force in the Temple on Coruscant... \n \nAfter destroying the Jedi Temple and overwhelming the Republic's defenses, Imperial forces occupied Coruscant, holding the planet hostage while negotiations restarted on Alderaan. With their capital at stake, Republic officials had little choice but to agree to the Empire's terms. \n \nThe Treaty of Coruscant was signed, forcing the Republic to cede control of several star systems and to acknowledge new boundaries of Imperial dominion. Though the treaty brought about an official end to the war, tensions between the two sides have remained high over the last several years, and now, a return to open war seems all but inevitable...","collection":23,"franchise":1,"franchises":[1],"rating":74.5633965863229,"popularity":8.333333333333332,"aggregated_rating":85,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":79.78169829316144,"total_rating_count":91,"rating_count":80,"games":[36950,55038,25300,17112,90099,68287,25311,113114,1877,16433],"tags":[18,268435468,536871376,536871475,536871808,536871812,536871882,536872056,536872245,536872549,536874842,536875257,536875432,536875735,536875784,536876797,536877193,536880090,536884509,1073741826],"developers":[3845],"publishers":[1,10],"game_engines":[87],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[464,563,896,900,970,1144,1333,1637,3930,4345,4520,4823,4872,5885,6281,9178,13597],"themes":[18],"genres":[12],"expansions":[22656,22659,22657,11178,22655,22658],"first_release_date":1324339200000,"pulse_count":8,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1324339200000,"human":"2011-Dec-20","y":2011,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"SWTOR","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bdax9vyqayhzjrnqjgbd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bdax9vyqayhzjrnqjgbd","width":1904,"height":1042},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ft6gcdsmvqzzie7qksgk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ft6gcdsmvqzzie7qksgk","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bduxxfzxucjagr6vloxx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bduxxfzxucjagr6vloxx","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qszfk2cdyhbfnhy5hzsd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qszfk2cdyhbfnhy5hzsd","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i8nns71p2m4nzy6u0b26.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i8nns71p2m4nzy6u0b26","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Hope Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"1ToztqqDcaY"},{"name":"Deceived Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"YdgmH9Vv2-I"},{"name":"Return (Cinematic Intro)","video_id":"0KKihVDtYWQ"},{"name":"Join the Fight Trailer","video_id":"YrhnbIiQaec"},{"name":"Signs of War Trailer","video_id":"gyYSx0R8N1A"},{"name":"Your Saga Begins Trailer","video_id":"fQN7ldkcf8g"},{"name":"Choose your side: Jedi Consular vs. Imperial Agent Trailer","video_id":"AQ-p5k8T6Jw"},{"name":"Choose your side:  Jedi Knight vs. Bounty Hunter Trailer","video_id":"wPwffI7SipY"},{"name":"Choose your side: Trooper vs. Sith Inquisitor Trailer","video_id":"NZzOsN7QGKs"},{"name":"Character Progression: Jedi Consular Trailer","video_id":"0_Lh-14Fj3k"},{"name":"Character Progression: Imperial Agent Trailer","video_id":"W3MgwlPX2jU"},{"name":"Bounty Hunter Progression Trailer","video_id":"r08qD7gxIQU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1il2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1il2","width":1272,"height":1800},"esrb":{"synopsis":"In this massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game, based on the Star Wars universe, players engage in a fictional conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Sith Empire. Players can choose from classic Star Wars roles (e.g., Jedi Knight, Bounty Hunter, Trooper) and complete quests to determine their path down the light or dark side of the Force. Players use light sabers, laser blasters, and telekinetic powers to battle a variety of human-like enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., aliens, cyborgs); battles frequently depict characters getting shot with lasers, slashed with light sabers, or shocked with lightning bolts. During the course of the game, players are presented with interactive cutscenes in which their choices play a vital role in the outcome of their story (e.g., using electrical attacks on restrained characters to collect information; killing someone instead of letting him go). Some sequences depict brief instances of blood and gore: to complete one quest, players must dip a skull in a pool of blood; in another mission, players deliver a severed head to a specific location and place it on a pike. Players can freely explore many areas in the game, including clubs that depict scantily clad female dancers with exposed cleavage; some sequences include dialogue with sexual innuendo (e.g., \u201cAn hour. I think I'm insulted. We'll need the whole night,\u201d \u201cI'll be sure to make conjugal visits,\u201d and \u201cCome, dear, let's forgo the nuptials and proceed to the honeymoon.\u201d). The words \u201cdamn\u201d and \u201chell\u201d can be heard in dialogue throughout the game.\r\n\r\nOnline Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB (Windows PC)","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence\r\n\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.bioware.android.apps.authenticator"},{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/star-wars-the-old-republic-security-key\/id996685033?mt=8"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/swtheoldrepublic"},{"category":8,"url":"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/swtorofficial"},{"category":6,"url":"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/swtor"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/swtor"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/starwarstheoldrepublic"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/starwars.wikia.com\/wiki\/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.swtor.com"}]}
