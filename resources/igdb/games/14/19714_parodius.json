{"id":19714,"name":"Parodius","slug":"parodius","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/parodius","created_at":1466622682725,"updated_at":1517270981991,"summary":"Gameplay is very similar to the Gradius series, with a few differences. Parodius retains the selectability of different weapons configurations but implements via four different characters: Vic Viper (from Gradius), Octopus, Twin Bee, and Pentarou. The second main difference is the addition of bell power-ups, from the Twinbee series. These bells act as one-time power-ups, allowing you to destroy every enemy on screen, fire huge beams of energy, etc. Enemies and environments from the Gradius games and Twinbee are mixed in along, with a host of anime-style opponents, which include scantily-clad women. All of the Gradius elements are integrated in a very light-hearted fashion. The Big Core, a regular boss within the Gradius series, is given a neon-look and is called \"Viva Core\". Moreover, there is a moai (Easter Island head statues) level, but all of the statues are given a much more animated look. The boss of that level, the Moai Head, fires other moai at the player by spitting them out of her mouth. The final boss, in typical Gradius fashion, is an unarmed enemy that once defeated, results in a destruction\/escape sequence.","collection":2200,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103020,27209,54775,56353,80916,103298,25633,10039,57372,51464],"tags":[1,27,268435461,268435489,536870990,536871078,536871208,536871262,536875056,536879161,536880906,1073741828],"developers":[159],"publishers":[2843,10174],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[78,166,296,350,4144,8249,9994],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":786412800000,"platforms":[32,7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":786412800000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Dec-03","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":32,"date":820368000000,"region":1,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":800841600000,"region":5,"human":"1995-May-19","y":1995,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Gokuj\u014d Parodius Da!
