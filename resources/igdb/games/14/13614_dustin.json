The player controls a convict who must bust his way out of prison and escape from the island. In order to do this the player must beat up prison guards collect\/ steal\/ barter various items around the prison grounds. The HUD has 8 inventory slots, an alert meter to show whether the guards are on the convicts trail, a clock to show the time of day and an energy meter. \n \nDustin involves a lot of point-and-click adventure style trial and error gameplay as the convict needs to collect various items in a certain order and then use them in the right places. One of the games difficulties was in finding out whereabouts to go around the prison since a lot of the screens where identical to each other. Dustin is a more primitive version of games like The Great Escape and is part of the legacy of prison break themed titles.","popularity":1,"games":[55036,29173,32510,55590,36553,9472,34823,23345,36269,13200],"tags":[268435471,536871535,536872733,536873064,536874694,536875151,536875199,536875271,536875523,536876410,536876597,536879133],"developers":[2531],"publishers":[2531],"category":0,"keywords":[623,1821,2152,3782,4239,4287,4359,4611,5498,5685,8221],"genres":[15],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t16xlcqwm7wvwctmjgf0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t16xlcqwm7wvwctmjgf0","width":735,"height":531}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bsiseelbi7fk6upekb4r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bsiseelbi7fk6upekb4r","width":968,"height":1212}}
