Destroy the invaders as they kamikaze into the atmosphere in an attempt to eliminate your precious home world. When (not if) the Earth's shields run out of energy or your ship is destroyed, the planet goes \"bye-bye\". You can restore your energy by finding and destroying an enemy attack base. The only way to find one of those is by following a returning fighter to the base.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[34919,25311,37419,33603,95340,32902,65827,55888,31515,78550],"tags":[1,268435461,268435469,268435471,268435488],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,13,15,32],"first_release_date":1422748800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":1422748800000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Feb-01","y":2015,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5z2f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5z2f","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5z2e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5z2e","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5z2d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5z2d","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5z2c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5z2c","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5z2b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5z2b","width":1920,"height":1080}],"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/946080"}],"external":{"steam":"946080"}}
