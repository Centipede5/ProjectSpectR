{"id":3614,"name":"Tonic Trouble","slug":"tonic-trouble","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/tonic-trouble","created_at":1389201142096,"updated_at":1517270860274,"summary":"Tonic Trouble is a 3D platforming video game by Ubisoft Montreal. The story follows the main character, Ed, after a magic potion spills on the Earth and causes vegetables to become living killers. The game was received poorly; critics cite poor controls, a wordy exposition, and sloppy graphics (on the N64 version). The N64 version of the game is a port of the PC version with noticeable differences, such as a substantially different opening due to the lack of processing power needed to render cutscenes, and different music in certain places. The game is often compared to another game published by Ubisoft called Rayman 2: The Great Escape, because both are 3D platformers, both have main characters of a similar design (hands and feet without arms or legs), and both were released around the same time.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[24426,19150,56033,19565,80916,20342,23733,22387,55173,33269],"tags":[1,27,268435464,268435487,536870915,536870926,536871208,536871262,536872234,536872961,536873299,536875073,536875074,536875244,536875517,536875713,536875803,536876270,536876353,536877001,536877294,536877434,536877435,536877764,536878052,536880306,536880406,536880511,536884032,1073741826],"developers":[38,1847],"publishers":[104],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3,14,296,350,1322,2049,2387,4161,4162,4332,4605,4801,4891,5358,5441,6089,6382,6522,6523,6852,7140,9394,9494,9599,13120],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[8,31],"first_release_date":932342400000,"platforms":[4,6,22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":932342400000,"human":"1999-Jul-19","y":1999,"m":7},{"category":1,"platform":22,"date":946684800000,"human":"2000-Jan","y":2000,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":944438400000,"human":"1999-Dec-06","y":1999,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ypvsp86eb3iajurcgjbg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ypvsp86eb3iajurcgjbg","width":256,"height":178},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3}}
