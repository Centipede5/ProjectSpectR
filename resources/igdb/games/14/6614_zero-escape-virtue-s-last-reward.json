It is story focused with multiple endings that use player choices and puzzle rooms to progress.\n\nAdditions to the game include an 'auto-advance text' mode, so players can listen to the voice acting without clicking through dialog, a memo function that allows players to note anything they feel is useful, and a flow chart that shows how alternate choices unfold. The in-game calculator has been removed.","storyline":"\"He awoke in an elevator.\n\nAcross the room was a strange girl he\u2019d never met before, even though she seemed to know him...\n\n\u201cSigma...\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know my name?\u201d he asked, but before she could answer a rabbit appeared. \u201cThis elevator is about to fall!\u201d\n\nSigma and the girl left the elevator only to find themselves in a massive room with seven other strangers...nine people in all.\n\nThe strange rabbit told them that they would have to play the Ambidex Game-a game of

is a puzzle-adventure game in which players follow characters attempting to escape from a mysterious warehouse. As players solve environmental puzzles and interact with fellow captives, their decisions trigger various cutscenes, some of which include brief acts of violence: players' character getting strangled in first person (the screen blurs and fades to black); a woman attempting to stab herself with a scalpel. As the game progresses, various sequences depict bloodstained rooms and\/or blood-splattered bodies, including characters lying in large pools of blood in the aftermath of a mass suicide (implied through on-screen text). Some of the dialogue contains sexual material\/innuendo (e.g., \u201cNot like I'm hoping to get my face sandwiched between a girl's bare thighs,\u201d \u201cJust leave me and Luna out of your sick fantasies, you creep,\u201d \u201c[A]re you trying to get me to take my clothes off?\u201d and \u201cCan you, like . . . kind of slide it down into your cleavage . . .\u201d). Pharmaceutical drugs are a central part of the plotline, and references to other illicit substances occur during various scenes: \u201cYou must be really desperate to get high,\u201d \u201cYou must've done a lot of drugs to look like that at twenty-two,\u201d \u201cOr was it just a hallucination, brought on by stress or maybe some strange drug they'd dosed me with while I was out?\u201d The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d also appear in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language - Mild bad language","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/virtueslastreward.com\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Zero_Escape:_Virtue's_Last_Reward"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/zeroescape.wikia.com\/wiki\/Zero_Escape:_Virtue's_Last_Reward"}]}
