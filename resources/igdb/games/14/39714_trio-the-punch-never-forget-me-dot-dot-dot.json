Most of the levels are played scrolling to the right, but some loop around the left and right edges of the screen. Other levels allow the player to scroll upwards or downwards by jumping, while some do not contain scrolling at all. The game is completed when the player finishes all 35 levels. \n \nThe player controls their character with an 8-way joystick and 3 buttons (attack, jump, and special attack). Certain enemies leave behind a heart on the screen after being defeated, and collecting the required number of these hearts for each level causes a boss to appear, who must be defeated in order to complete the level. However, bosses appear from the start in some levels, so hearts do not always need to be collected.","popularity":5.666666666666667,"games":[76253,91140,99737,99460,103312,100800,52747,103301,103298,48663],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":641520000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":641520000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-May-01","y":1990,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1iuc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1iuc","width":311,"height":420}}
