The human-controlled players will be indicated by the \"squares\" (1P and 3P) and \"crosses\" (2P and 4P) upon their heads - and just like in real association football, whoever has the most goals when the timer has run out wins the game. 1P and 2P's team is black, and 3P and 4P's team is white; and as with the four-player version of Atari's earlier American football game, one credit buys a two-player game and two buy a four-player game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":286675200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":286675200000,"region":8,"human":"1979-Feb-01","y":1979,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qvocnpj4orbiiapdbsjd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qvocnpj4orbiiapdbsjd","width":850,"height":1102}}
