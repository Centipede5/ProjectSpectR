From first- and third-person perspectives, players use sniper rifles, machine guns, pistols, and explosives to kill hordes of zombies, skeletons, fire demons, and undead soldiers. Players use stealth tactics to dispatch enemies from varying ranges (e.g., crouching behind rubble to take a shot). Gun battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, and large splashes of blood as zombies are struck. Performing accurate shots triggers short cutscenes which follow the bullet's trajectory in slow motion; the bullet is shown shattering enemies' skulls or bones in X-ray view, with large blood-splatter effects. During one level, players' character can drink from bottles to get \u201cdead drunk\u201d; the screen wobbles slightly and aiming is impaired for characters.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":5},"external":{"steam":"301640"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":4,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
