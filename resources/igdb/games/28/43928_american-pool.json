In Training mode, players learn the controls and various pool techniques by solving tasks and problems, while Pocket Game mode offers five types of pool including 9-Ball, 8-Ball, Basic, Rotation and 14-1 Rack. The final mode, Pool Contest, is a 9-Ball bracketed tournament in which players create their own character and level up with special shots and techniques as they advance through the pairings. \n \nExamples of special skills that can be earned include Low Tech (adds a visual line from the cue ball to facilitate aiming), Easy Shot (drops the speed of the power gauge by one-third), and Free Ball (allows the cue ball to be placed in any location). As players reach higher levels of skill, additional abilities are unlocked. Specific conventions used in American Pool include \"Texas Express Rules\" in 9-Ball games, the requirement to \"call your shot\" in 8-Ball, and the loser of banking in 14-1 Rack taking the break shot.","popularity":1,"games":[67110,61750,58302,55079,44927,40605,40172,14305,14304,46820],"tags":[268435470,536872928],"category":0,"keywords":[2016],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1054857600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":1054857600000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Jun-06","y":2003,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rwxfvudsyynqbghqsm9z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rwxfvudsyynqbghqsm9z","width":650,"height":650},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
