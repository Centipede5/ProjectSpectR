Contamination also destroys eggs and hatchling dinosaurs on contact, reducing the player's score. While within the transport force field, Tim is safe from all creatures except the Dino Mom.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,28029,1073,76229,10039,1188,68287,25311,71455,1715],"tags":[1,18,268435464,1073741828],"publishers":[9512],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[13,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zgchjl2nlcibkfyfexqp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zgchjl2nlcibkfyfexqp","width":1000,"height":1320}}
