{"id":40628,"name":"Chase the Chuck Wagon","slug":"chase-the-chuck-wagon","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/chase-the-chuck-wagon","created_at":1498481971900,"updated_at":1515639708256,"summary":"In the 80's, the popular commercial for Purina dog food included a dog chasing a tiny chuckwagon across the kitchen floor. Inspired by this, Chase the Chuckwagon was produced by Spectravision and released as a promotional item from the Ralston Purina Company. Buy lots of dog food and you could own this. The simple rarity of this game combined with its historical coolness makes it one of the \"holy grail\" games. The object is to navigate the dog through a maze in an effort to reach the chuckwagon, while avoiding the dog catcher and other obstacles. If he makes it, an animation shows the dog chasing after the chuckwagon and stopping to eat the dog food that falls out of it.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23175,59516,55289,25646,37022,25311,47823,37088,12579,25300],"tags":[1,268435487,536871599,536875727,536875939,536877803,536879868],"category":0,"keywords":[687,4815,5027,6891,8956],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":436492800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":59,"date":436492800000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Nov-01","y":1983,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mmjkuqxapvvil6kk4zdr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mmjkuqxapvvil6kk4zdr","width":900,"height":636}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/viyzhnranipz6dcd9pjb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"viyzhnranipz6dcd9pjb","width":600,"height":810}}
