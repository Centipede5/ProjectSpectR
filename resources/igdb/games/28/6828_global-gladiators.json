A Super Nintendo port was also in development but was never completed for undisclosed reasons, though a prototype exists on the Internet. The game is loosely based on the McDonald's fast food chain and has a strong environmentalist message. \n \nA Game Boy port of the title was also fully developed (by Damian Stones, of Climax) but was never released for the same legal reasons as the Super Nintendo port. \n \nIn the single-player game, the player controls Mick or Mack through four worlds; Slime World, Mystical Forest, Toxi-town and Arctic World. Each world has several sub-stages where the character must collect a certain number of Golden Arches to advance. \n \nThey are guided in their quest by Ronald McDonald, who appears at the beginning and the end of the game. The characters are armed with a Super Soaker-type gun that shoots gooey projectiles. \n \nThe game engine is the same used in other Virgin Interactive games such as Cool Spot and Disney's Aladdin, as all of them (Mega Drive\/Genesis versions) were handled by David Perry's programming team, which eventually turned into Shiny Entertainment.","collection":3282,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,10039,36926,47823,68324,12632,19174,1070,51485,27209],"tags":[1,268435464,536871186,536871208,536871971,536871983,536872961,536875094,536875727,536875871,536876694,536879868,536880463,536885995,1073741828],"developers":[1238],"publishers":[1860],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[274,296,1059,1071,2049,4182,4815,4959,5782,8956,9551,15083],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[29,35,16,64],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":7,"platform":35,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":64,"human":"TBD"},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Mick & Mack: Global Gladiators\nMick & Mack as the Global Gladiators","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Mick and Mack: Global Gladiators"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vyycvnz1ciz972ksdqqy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vyycvnz1ciz972ksdqqy","width":512,"height":448},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i6exzai3g6uza32g5dyz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i6exzai3g6uza32g5dyz","width":512,"height":448}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mxkzzxuntu7omi7sqavu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mxkzzxuntu7omi7sqavu","width":256,"height":360}}
