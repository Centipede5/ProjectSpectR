Its purpose was to draw the Winds of Magic from the world as a sinkhole drains an ocean, and blast the Daemonic hordes back to the Realm of Chaos. Now the Great Vortex falters, and the world again stands at the brink of ruin. \n \nPowerful forces move to heal the maelstrom and avert catastrophe. Yet others seek to harness its terrible energies for their own bitter purpose. The race is on, and the very fate of the world will lie in the hands of the victor. \n \nPrince Tyrion, Defender of Ulthuan, guides the High Elves in their desperate efforts to stabilise the vortex as it roils above their home continent. \n \nAtop his palanquin-throne, the Slann Mage-Priest Mazdamundi directs his Lizardmen war-hosts as they surge northward from Lustria. He, too, is intent on preventing cataclysm, though the methods of The Old Ones must prevail. \n \nThe Witch King Malekith and his sadistic Dark Elf hordes spew forth from Naggaroth and their labyrinthine Black Arks. He tastes great weakness in the vortex \u2013 and great opportunity in its demise. \n \nMeanwhile a fourth, secretive race stirs, their motives obscured by sinister plots and machinations. The time for revelation is nigh\u2026 \n \nFour races, four outcomes, a single goal: control of the Great Vortex, for good or ill.\"","collection":2651,"franchise":977,"franchises":[977,509],"hypes":5,"rating":79.94123002585509,"popularity":11,"aggregated_rating":87.875,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":83.90811501292754,"total_rating_count":19,"rating_count":8,"games":[55044,23733,54775,36926,6414,22387,55092,27092,7615,34269],"tags":[1,17,268435467,268435471,536871208,536872272,536874694,536875066,536875136,536882999,536883062,536883468,1073741827],"developers":[111],"publishers":[112],"game_engines":[234],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[296,1360,3782,4154,4224,12087,12150,12556],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[11,15],"expansions":[81190],"dlcs":[81191,110863,81192],"first_release_date":1506556800000,"pulse_count":140,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1542672000000,"human":"2018-Nov-20","y":2018,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1542672000000,"human":"2018-Nov-20","y":2018,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1506556800000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Sep-28","y":2017,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1506556800000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Sep-28","y":2017,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Total War: Warhammer 2"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ees6gx4wycxfmfganjvo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ees6gx4wycxfmfganjvo","width":7467,"height":4200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/itebycobrpgfw2ypk1qe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"itebycobrpgfw2ypk1qe","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g6sodjhe9hvrgdm8s032.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g6sodjhe9hvrgdm8s032","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tkwtagw7psi7zkv1wtmv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tkwtagw7psi7zkv1wtmv","width":7467,"height":4200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cwbj3sz9z80xnh7pdkrx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cwbj3sz9z80xnh7pdkrx","width":7467,"height":4200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fut6nxqcwezlnxykfepm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fut6nxqcwezlnxykfepm","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/puiwrapnxdvjjiy2gkcp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"puiwrapnxdvjjiy2gkcp","width":7467,"height":4200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e9hhqm5nvxyxppbrhi9s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e9hhqm5nvxyxppbrhi9s","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zrqwkot4jpga5xbi2nwb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zrqwkot4jpga5xbi2nwb","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bqnlb13q0ah2l7ioslqf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bqnlb13q0ah2l7ioslqf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bfpn6dfw1ow8i3wpexk3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bfpn6dfw1ow8i3wpexk3","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r9bnc1hfyrgbxgbftqfr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r9bnc1hfyrgbxgbftqfr","width":1920,"height":1080}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t8qklxtcpjzlfoxuxzw4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t8qklxtcpjzlfoxuxzw4","width":4000,"height":2250},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qlo7gbdgafijrl1e0b3j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qlo7gbdgafijrl1e0b3j","width":13938,"height":9000},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i2apmebpl2tvwqzp2uy4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i2apmebpl2tvwqzp2uy4","width":4000,"height":2250},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tkz8xbo1xia5twpek7g9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tkz8xbo1xia5twpek7g9","width":4000,"height":2250}],"videos":[{"name":"10 Ways to Die Trailer","video_id":"D-wjXg8cZaI"},{"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"n2wvG5HBwx4"},{"name":"Skaven Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"uQkzGaZwK5A"},{"name":"First Look: Campaign Trailer","video_id":"x_if9xNHw-Y"},{"name":"Dark Elves Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"QN7_NOSobmo"},{"name":"Interview","video_id":"W9nHYGR8F2o"},{"name":"E3 2017 Gameplay","video_id":"Gd1OIvSK37U"},{"name":"Lizard Men Trailer","video_id":"FLb7g4VKWUo"},{"name":"Announcement Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"Aw6As7MqvCQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jtb3tn5zdf7ryqjoozsh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jtb3tn5zdf7ryqjoozsh","width":450,"height":600},"esrb":{"synopsis":"Platform: Windows PC\r\n\r\nRating Summary: This is a real-time strategy game, based on the Warhammer universe, in which players fight for supremacy in a fantastical world. Players follow a storyline while commanding races and factions (e.g., elves, lizard men) and engaging in diplomacy. From a top-down perspective, players arrange armies and fantasy creatures on the battlefield, giving commands and observing combat. Battles are highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and depictions of bodies scattered on the battlefield. Cutscenes depict characters stalked and stabbed by assassins, with splashes of pink blood on the screen. Some creatures are depicted with bloody wounds during gameplay. The dialogue occasionally references suggestive material (e.g., \u201cAh, but the truth is like an expensive wh*re, Jerek. She comes in many dresses and will bend over for any with the money to pamper her\u201d; \u201c[A] man born of dock wh*res, yet calls himself a 'prince'\u201d). Dialogue also references wine, ale, grog, and binge-drinking (e.g., \u201cThe favourite dwarf pastime is drinking. 'Gorog' is Khazalid for binge-drinking...\u201d); one cutscene also depicts poisoned wine splashing from a goblet. The words \u201carse\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d appear in dialogue.\r\n\r\nOnline Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB (Windows PC)","rating":5},"external":{"steam":"594570"}}
