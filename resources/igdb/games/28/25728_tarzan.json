Found and brought up by a she-ape named Kala, he grew to learn the ways of the jungle and the language of the beasts. Years later, as John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke, he was brought back to England to claim his rightful inheritance. However, he occasionally returns to the wild to become Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle. \n \nNow is one of those occasions. Tarzan has returned to the jungle with his wife, Lady Jane Greystoke, but their holiday came to an end when Usanga, evil chief of the Wamabo, kidnaps Jane to force Tarzan into retrieving the seven gemstones that were stolen from his tribal shrine. These gemstones are believed to be the Eyes of the Rainbow, representing each color of the spectrum. Tarzan has been given three days to find the gemstones, otherwise Jane will be eaten by the tribal pet, Sheeta the Panther. \n \nAfter consulting his information sources, Tarzan learns that the Eyes of the Rainbow have been scattered around the dense jungle by a family of pesky chimps. Tarzan's quest involves navigating dark caves, crevasses, swamps, and treacherous quicksand. \n \nObjects, such as the rope and torch, need to be found if Tarzan wants to find each gemstone. Throughout the quest, hazards such asheadhunters, lions, snakes, spiders, quicksands, and pits are encountered. If Tarzan comes into contact with any of these hazards, he becomes stunned for an hour and the on-screen timer shrinks accordingly. Fortunately, he can punch creatures, allowing him to escape them. \n \nIf Tarzan manages to find all seven gemstones within the time limit and deliver them to Usanga, Jane will be released. If not, she will become nothing more than another bowl of jungle soup.","franchise":901,"franchises":[901],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[1070,1073,109460,76253,103316,16746,103312,1071,1066,10039],"tags":[1,268435464,1073741828],"developers":[10599],"publishers":[2426],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[68],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iloyn18lykoixtddwmhv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iloyn18lykoixtddwmhv","width":1000,"height":1300}}
