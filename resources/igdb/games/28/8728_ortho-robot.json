Your objective is to reach the ending green block (either by standing directly on it or standing on it in relative space). For some extra challenge, try to collect all coins and perfect your time, steps and number of warps.","popularity":1,"games":[27266,25222,25646,26239,14047,51978,28465,19222,34919,33603],"tags":[268435465,268435488,1073741828],"developers":[4644],"publishers":[4644],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[9,32],"first_release_date":1325289600000,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1325289600000,"human":"2011","y":2011,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":3,"date":1325289600000,"human":"2011","y":2011,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1325289600000,"human":"2011","y":2011,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nlgrapdyqgmp00xmsc30.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nlgrapdyqgmp00xmsc30","width":1024,"height":768}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p4jbw07rmtbcyekumq0s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p4jbw07rmtbcyekumq0s","width":480,"height":360}}
