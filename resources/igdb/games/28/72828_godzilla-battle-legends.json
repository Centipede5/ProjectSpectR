For example, Godzilla looks like as he did in 1955 when he fights Anguirus, and as in 1964 when he fights Rodan. This game's sequel, Godzilla: Monster War for the SNES, features fewer monsters, with the inclusion of Biollante as a playable character and Mothra. \n \nIn single player mode, only Godzilla is playable.","collection":3301,"franchise":205,"franchises":[205],"hypes":1,"popularity":4.666666666666666,"games":[68287,55038,17130,36739,34823,36950,1877,13200,13660,11490],"tags":[18,268435460,536871019,536871882,536871972,536875054,536875717,1073741828],"developers":[828,3920],"publishers":[864,3920],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[107,970,1060,4142,4805],"themes":[18],"genres":[4],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Godzilla: Bakutou Retsuden","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q6tnyiosdy0yoyxir7yp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q6tnyiosdy0yoyxir7yp","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ofvgfinf1z6koaomsloz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ofvgfinf1z6koaomsloz","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fvriwmk5mhxhdsd6fldm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fvriwmk5mhxhdsd6fldm","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yxototrmtstjvwxxptkf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yxototrmtstjvwxxptkf","width":320,"height":297}}
