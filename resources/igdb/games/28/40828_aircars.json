{"id":40828,"name":"AirCars","slug":"aircars","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/aircars","created_at":1498488874229,"updated_at":1516166341885,"summary":"Designed by Midnight Entertainment Group in 1995, ICD released AirCars in limited numbers. No real box was made (it came shrinkwrapped inside a box insert), but the cartridge included a label and manual, along with a picture of what the overlay might look like. This is an action\/battle game in which you must destroy enemy bases while in your Air Car, and it supports up to 8 players using CatBoxes or 2 players using a JagLink. Although better graphics can be found on the Jaguar and control is a bit sluggish, linking 8 players using CatBoxes can be a unique experience. The hard part will be finding those extra CatBoxes and copies of AirCars.","popularity":1,"games":[68287,44242,23212,19301,36950,9789,142,18623,28029,64204],"tags":[18,268435461,268435469,536870937,536871882,536871937,536872060,536874539],"category":0,"keywords":[25,970,1025,1148,3627],"themes":[18],"genres":[5,13],"first_release_date":867369600000,"platforms":[62],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":62,"date":867369600000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Jun-27","y":1997,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tm2acijfhtbhvcpx2w6w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tm2acijfhtbhvcpx2w6w","width":807,"height":605}}
