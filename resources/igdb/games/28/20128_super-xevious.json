{"id":20128,"name":"Super Xevious","slug":"super-xevious","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/super-xevious","created_at":1468097460879,"updated_at":1517270743916,"summary":"The gameplay is very much like that of the original Xevious except this time it is a little more difficult. Several new enemies have also been introduced (including a silver Galaxian flagship, a rare silver Galaga \"scorpion\" ship, two jet planes, a helicopter, and a dark yellow Tank Battalion tank). Some of these enemies will reset the player's score back to 0 if they are destroyed - and the hidden \"Sol Citadel\" towers and Rally-X Special Flags are also located in different places.","collection":2237,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,25300,71455,11253,142,19448],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871882,536872862,536873064,536875453,536875879,536875942,536876634,536876657,1073741827],"developers":[11315],"publishers":[11315,10317],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[166,970,1950,2152,4541,4967,5030,5722,5745],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":473299200000,"platforms":[52,121,18],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":473299200000,"region":5,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":527472000000,"region":5,"human":"1986-Sep-19","y":1986,"m":9},{"category":1,"platform":121,"date":549504000000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Jun","y":1987,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Super Xevious: GAMP no Nazo","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Xevious 2","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Vs.
