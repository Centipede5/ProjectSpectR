Players complete quests to 'level up' their customized characters, while gaining powers and better equipment along the way. Quest objectives sometimes involve using magic and hand-to-hand combat to defeat various creatures, enemy soldiers, and occasionally other characters such as innocent villagers. Some attacks can result in splashes of red blood, while collateral damage also includes bursts of flesh and bone falling to the ground. Certain quests require the player to drink alcohol, resulting in the character's impaired vision (blurry screen, pink elephants) and movement. Players can interact with scantily clad characters, listen to provocative dialogue (e.g., \"Is that a mana wyrm in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?\"), or view sexually suggestive dance routines performed by elves and other player-characters.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.worldofwarcraft.com\/wrath"}]}
