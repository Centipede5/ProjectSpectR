Each level is a single screen. The first image that the player sees is a landscape, for example, a forest or a town. The image will then fade into a \"corrupt\" version of the landscape, for example, the trees become rotten and buildings become ruined. Each screen has a \"Qualify\" target that shows how much of the screen must be cleared before the game continues to the next level.","popularity":3,"games":[24426,26223,78149,19241,27092,25222,20329,47823,25646,23733],"tags":[1,268435465,536871138,536871208,536871878,536872649,536873064,536873154,536873590,536873787,536875308,536875699,536875766,536876333,536877305],"category":0,"keywords":[226,296,966,1737,2152,2242,2678,2875,4396,4787,4854,5421,6393],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":722304000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":19,"date":757296000000,"region":2,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":722304000000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Nov-21","y":1992,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/apo6wuxnkicpbit52y4w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"apo6wuxnkicpbit52y4w","width":1000,"height":699},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cacoma_Knight_in_Bizyland"}]}
