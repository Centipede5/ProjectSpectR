Set in a vast open archipelago, Carrier Command: Gaea Mission brings a breathtaking combination of action game and strategy elements! \n \nAs a result of a catastrophic war between the United Earth Coalition and the Asian Pacific Alliance, Earth has been rendered an almost uninhabitable wasteland. The only hope lies in a distant planetary system, where the moon Taurus holds the key to restoring Earth's dwindling water supply. As a battle-hardened member of the surviving UEC forces, Lt Myrik is put in command of an armed vehicle carrier. By traversing the seas and establishing a network of island bases, his mission is to hunt down the enemy and conquer the Dead Zone on the planetoid Taurus.","collection":4613,"rating":65,"popularity":3.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":59.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":62.25,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":1,"games":[17130,8773,17111,8422,68287,78550,9789,55029,14758,34823],"tags":[1,18,39,268435461,268435467,268435469,268435471,536870913,536871201,536871618,536871882,536871937,536872060,536872070,536872383,536872685,536873043,536874916,536875046,536875047,536875171,536875492,536875593,536876695,536878415,1073741827,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[116],"publishers":[832,116,1466],"game_engines":[197],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,289,706,970,1025,1148,1158,1471,1773,2131,4004,4134,4135,4259,4580,4681,5783,7503],"themes":[1,18,39],"genres":[5,11,13,15],"first_release_date":1348790400000,"platforms":[6,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1348790400000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Sep-28","y":2012,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1348790400000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Sep-28","y":2012,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/miye183gyfuwclfo4de0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"miye183gyfuwclfo4de0","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vzpubfqpfwbuggwbzun2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vzpubfqpfwbuggwbzun2","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yt3ttnyuss6obbpbjzwz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yt3ttnyuss6obbpbjzwz","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uuomujoffpduvmbyw04a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uuomujoffpduvmbyw04a","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xsimrfi9mgxfvawfvpx4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xsimrfi9mgxfvawfvpx4","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"rWYsmKUoZsA"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"3wZSajenbdo"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sfvebin5pwhqhepu9xeo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sfvebin5pwhqhepu9xeo","width":200,"height":283},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action-strategy game in which players execute futuristic military campaigns on a distant planet. In addition to first-person\u2013style missions, players can initiate tactical assaults from overhead and third-person perspectives. Firearms, airships, and ground vehicles can be used to complete mission objectives and destroy robot enemies in frenetic combat; battles are accompanied by realistic gunfire and large explosions. Human characters can also be run over, shot, and killed, resulting in cries of pain and brief blood splashes. Cutscenes depict additional acts of violence: a blood-splattered prisoner getting interrogated (the camera cuts away as he gets electrocuted); a villain getting shot at close range. The words \u201cf**k,\u201d \u201csh*t,\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carrier_Command:_Gaea_Mission"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.carriercommand.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/65740"}],"external":{"steam":"65740"}}
