Some scenes depict still images of characters engaged in violent acts: a man punching a character, as cries of pain and impact sounds are heard; several figures bound to chairs before and after being shot to death; wounded characters with bloodstained clothing or trickles of blood on their mouths\/faces. Several other scenes depict large blood-splatter effects staining the screen. The game contains brief references to sexual assault in the dialogue, though no activity is ever shown. Dialogue also mentions drugs\/drug use (e.g., \"...quantity of drugs on the bed,\" \u201cShimizu was on drugs,\u201d \u201cI guess if he was on drugs it'd make sense...\u201d).
