I thoight I already defeated these creeps! What are they doing back! \n \nI can't believe these greasy slimeballs have the guts to go toe to toe with Barthlomew J. Simpson again! Then again, I can't expect such putrid slime to learn the first time. AND these jerks smell like a monster from the bottom of the swamp... like a Swamp Thing! \n \nTime to dust off the old X-Ray specs, shake up my favorite can of Brand-X spray paint, and pull off some radical tricks on my skateboard. These space slugs don't know who they are messing with. Bring it on! This is one Simpson you don't want to mess with. \n \nTHE SPACE MUTANTS have a few words for Bart: \nThat Simpson boy is really dumb! Our homages to him are fake and we are back stronger than ever! So, Bart Simpson, resistance is useless!!! His mutant hunt has already begun but we learned with our errors from the past. We will never be defeated again! Well, looks like Bart is at Lake Terror. I will send an extra amount of my mutant soldiers to kill him!!!
