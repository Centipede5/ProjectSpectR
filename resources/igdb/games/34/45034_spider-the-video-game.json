You begin at a sector map which functions as a blueprint of the research laboratory which you must explore. In order to clear a level, you must collect a required number of microchips. You must also find exits in each area in order to advance to the next level. \n \nThe spider is always equipped with a Slasher leg and webbing, and he is capable of enhancing his fighting ability with weapons by collecting power-ups. The weapons include homing missiles, flame throwers, boomerangs, and electro-beams.
