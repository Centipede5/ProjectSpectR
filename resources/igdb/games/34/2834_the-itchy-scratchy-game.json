The player controls Itchy, the mouse, and must defeat Scratchy, the cat, with a variety of weapons. Itchy caries a default mallet, but can pick up additional weapons on particular levels. Each of the seven levels takes place in a different fictional location and is designed as a maze of doors and platforms. After defeating Scratchy, he usually will return with a special contraption to attack Itchy, and must therefore be defeated again.","collection":4272,"franchise":89,"franchises":[89],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[20342,36868,3766,8025,71628,33269,19150,24426,51464,2765],"tags":[1,27,268435464,536871262,536872961,536875054,536875074,536875088,536875209,536875241,536875291,536875292,536875590],"developers":[1330],"publishers":[287],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[350,2049,4142,4162,4176,4297,4329,4379,4380,4678],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":757296000000,"platforms":[29,35,19],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":19,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":35,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The Itchy and Scratchy Game","comment":"Other"},{"name":"The Itchy & Scratchy Game"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uljj2zp9iefsendp22l7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uljj2zp9iefsendp22l7","width":252,"height":357},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3}}
