The player controls a number of individual units in each map, which can be directed in various ways, such as to approach and attack a particular target, construct or demolish structures, or form or disband units. \n \nThe single-player scenario begins with Caesar receiving orders from Rome to suppress a revolt in Asia. There is also a free battle mode for one or two players that features several dozen maps to choose from. A unique feature of the game is the highly configurable menu system. The player can move, resize, rearrange, and close any of the different information windows as they see fit.","collection":857,"popularity":1,"games":[2015,55029,12982,22399,39257,6985,18623,16125,24512,55036],"tags":[22,268435467,268435471,536871205,536872383],"category":0,"keywords":[293,1471],"themes":[22],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":707011200000,"region":2,"human":"1992-May-28","y":1992,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p0tfv2uedkxzvprjdv7l.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p0tfv2uedkxzvprjdv7l","width":640,"height":905}}
