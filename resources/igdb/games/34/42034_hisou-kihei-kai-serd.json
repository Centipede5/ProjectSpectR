The game was exclusive to the PC Engine and was released soon after another mecha strategy game from Masaya: Gaiflame. \n \nIn each scenario, the Serds - a league of specialized attack mecha - are deployed from their HQ ship Altea. The Serds all have single-letter code-names and different specializations: for example, the G-Serd wields a laser sword for devastating melee attacks and can move quickly, while the B-Serd is capable of long-range mortar attacks but has limited movement. The eponymous X-Serd is the most powerful of the team.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":638150400000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":638150400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Mar-23","y":1990,"m":3}]}
