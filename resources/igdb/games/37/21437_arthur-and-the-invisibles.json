Arthur and the Minimoys for DS\u2122 gleefully portrays the magical world of Arthur through a series of original and entertaining micro games and with an absorbing 'virtual pet simulator' where players are responsible for caring for and breeding 'Mul mull', small, fluffy, flying creatures found in abundance in the world of Arthur.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[47823,36856,11567,55752,28154,11560,55092,23175,6414,1059],"tags":[268435464,536871208,536871945,536872475,536875054,536875257,536875294,536876694,536884018],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1033,1563,4142,4345,4382,5782,13106],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1170979200000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1170979200000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Feb-09","y":2007,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Arthur and the Minimoys","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nuolwmec8dusp6pltxwy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nuolwmec8dusp6pltxwy","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pgbro0bvzp5eqejk0z2v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pgbro0bvzp5eqejk0z2v","width":650,"height":927},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":2}}
