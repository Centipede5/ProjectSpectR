The local government has been losing trading convoys passing through the asteroid belt that surrounds the system, and has contracted with you to help hold off the unknown enemy until help from The Federation can arrive. \n \nYou start the game in a single-shot fighter spacecraft, with the ability to upgrade your armament as you collect bounties on each enemy ship (as well as asteroids) you destroy. Every five waves you automatically return to the Auburn weapons shop where you can buy your upgrades.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,36950,68287,25311,23175,27314,27523,17469,29525,59516],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487],"developers":[14451],"category":0,"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":915062400000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":915062400000,"region":8,"human":"1998","y":1998,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"vmSU1NAATxE"}],"esrb":{"rating":6}}
