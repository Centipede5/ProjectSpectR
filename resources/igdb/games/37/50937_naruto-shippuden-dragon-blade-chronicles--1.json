Despite this, it seems to use graphics similar to the aforementioned Clash of Ninja games, and even reuses several models. All characters wear new, armoured outfits that are based on their normal attire, with the exception of Tsunade and Jiraiya.","popularity":1,"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1292457600000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1292457600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Dec-16","y":2010,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ktwaixqrlqwn2wpryeab.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ktwaixqrlqwn2wpryeab","width":1527,"height":2149}}
