{"id":1637,"name":"James Bond 007: The Duel","slug":"james-bond-007-the-duel","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/james-bond-007-the-duel","created_at":1351021086230,"updated_at":1515689775729,"summary":"The Duel is a James Bond video game released for the Sega Master System, the Sega Game Gear, and the Sega Mega Drive \/ Genesis. The game was developed and published by Domark and released in 1993.\nArmed with a pistol, the player controls James Bond through various side-scrolling enemy bases to rescue female hostages and arm a bomb placed at a strategic point to destroy the base. Along the way, Bond must battle numerous thugs and familiar bosses.\nThe game is notable among Bond games for a number of reasons. Although it was released 4 years after Timothy Dalton's last outing as James Bond, his likeness is used in the game, most notably the opening screens, thus making it Dalton's last appearance in a Bond game to date. It was also the final Bond game to be released by Domark. It was also the first Bond game not to be directly based on a movie or novel. Instead it featured an original storyline, albeit one featuring familiar villains including Jaws and Oddjob. Though the game's storyline was not its strong point, it did blaze a trail for future licence-holders EA, half of whose Bond output would be based on original storylines. One previous Bond game, Operation Stealth, included an original storyline but the game was originally based on a generic Bond-style character named John Glames and only had the licence added for its North American release.","collection":326,"franchise":37,"franchises":[37],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,68287,55752,36856,72373,28029,76229,36781,6732,36718],"tags":[1,268435461,268435464,536870953,536871937,536871971,536872131,536872179,536874706,536875054,536875081,536875140,536875294,536875305,536875358,536876030,536876274,536876381,536876422,536876687,536876694,1073741828],"developers":[880],"publishers":[880],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[41,1025,1059,1219,1267,3794,4142,4169,4228,4382,4393,4446,5118,5362,5469,5510,5775,5782],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":737337600000,"platforms":[29,35,64],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":737337600000,"human":"1993-May-14","y":1993,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":64,"date":737337600000,"human":"1993-May-14","y":1993,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":737337600000,"human":"1993-May-14","y":1993,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"007: The Duel"},{"name":"007 Shitou","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cpgkzltdmesm38grlfu3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cpgkzltdmesm38grlfu3","width":640,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yt5scgaylhik5blgougn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yt5scgaylhik5blgougn","width":700,"height":1032},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/jamesbond.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Duel"}]}
