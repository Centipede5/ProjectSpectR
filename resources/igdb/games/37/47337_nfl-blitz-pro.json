For the first time in the series' long-running history Blitz will feature a slew of realistic NFL elements mixed with the fast-paced and action-centered gameplay that fans have come to know and love. New 11-on-11 gameplay takes the action to the pro-level; making it possible to include every player, team and position. An extensive new ten-season Franchise Mode allows gamers to experience player trading and drafting, and improved graphics and animations take advantage of motion-capture technology; making those bone-crunching hits painfully realistic.","collection":2201,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23443,3559,47756,78935,43705,47365,64743,4590,52551,54662],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536870939,536875494,536875749,536877686,536878091,536878092,536878093,536878125,536879654,536879655,536879656,536879657,536879658,536879670,536880425,536883028,536884027],"category":0,"keywords":[26,27,4582,4837,6774,7179,7180,7181,7213,8742,8743,8744,8745,8746,8758,9513,12116,13115],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1070755200000,"platforms":[11],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1070755200000,"region":8,"human":"2003-Dec-07","y":2003,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gkr3ivdnoaoek2tnkzpq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gkr3ivdnoaoek2tnkzpq","width":720,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qvabrjt5cjzmgr3e46jm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qvabrjt5cjzmgr3e46jm","width":640,"height":800},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
