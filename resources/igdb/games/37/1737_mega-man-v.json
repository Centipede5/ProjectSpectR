It is the fifth and final game in the Game Boy version of the original Mega Man series. The game follows the adventures of the protagonist Mega Man as he must defend the Earth from a group of powerful robots from outer space called the \"Stardroids\". Mega Man V was also unique from the previous Game Boy Mega Man games as it features original and unique bosses rather than recycling those from the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games.","collection":337,"franchise":38,"franchises":[38],"rating":79.96527815708771,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":79.96527815708771,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":7,"games":[76723,55038,1736,36950,68287,25300,10039,25311,1733,1749],"tags":[1,18,268435464,536871882,536871971,536872983,536873064,536874398,536875077,536875241,536875282,536875934,536876353,536876499,536877607,536879696,536880072,536880390,536881163,536881427,1073741828],"developers":[1403],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"keywords":[970,1059,2071,2152,3486,4165,4329,4370,5022,5441,5587,6695,8784,9160,9478,10251,10515],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":774835200000,"platforms":[37,33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1409184000000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Aug-28","y":2014,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1383696000000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Nov-06","y":2013,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1400716800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-May-22","y":2014,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":774835200000,"human":"1994-Jul-22","y":1994,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Rockman World 5Mega Man 5","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Rockman World 5"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yzfuzzvkapicibokc6s9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yzfuzzvkapicibokc6s9","width":455,"height":408},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rijlyszc7t9e8msq01zi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rijlyszc7t9e8msq01zi","width":452,"height":408},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dhz3v8afcwnjjqseq0df.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dhz3v8afcwnjjqseq0df","width":455,"height":408},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ftzrcx2oopnf6b24zh9h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ftzrcx2oopnf6b24zh9h","width":454,"height":407},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tnsjxhshbhe8yjaqzlza.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tnsjxhshbhe8yjaqzlza","width":453,"height":407}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"qFN-IUbkxS8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ugsoypdtr9bngatdsgrj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ugsoypdtr9bngatdsgrj","width":640,"height":637},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action-platformer in which players control a small character that shoots and jumps its way through sci-fi environments to defeat enemy robots.
