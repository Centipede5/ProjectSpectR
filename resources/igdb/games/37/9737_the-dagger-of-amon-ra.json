Laura Bow, fresh out of college, is hired by a New York newspaper and told to investigate a museum theft. The item is a priceless ancient Egyptian artifact, and possible suspects prove plentiful. During a party to celebrate the opening of the museum's new section, someone is murdered and Laura, after asking to be allowed to investigate, is locked in. This sets the stage for a series of murders, much in the same vein as the original game.","collection":1603,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[17470,79999,26298,25877,37419,87499,28277,76397,78632,36334],"tags":[268435487,536871109,536871127,536871210,536872350,1073741828],"developers":[32],"publishers":[32],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[197,215,298,1438],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Laura Bow: The Dagger of Amon Ra"},{"name":"Roberta Williams' Laura Bow in: The Dagger of Amon Ra"},{"name":"Laura Bow II"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uhrqrj0nn35aj71sjjod.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uhrqrj0nn35aj71sjjod","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qiflesszxf9ui3tnn8sf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qiflesszxf9ui3tnn8sf","width":320,"height":200}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/djkdja63wlrlaa2eila5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"djkdja63wlrlaa2eila5","width":252,"height":311},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Dagger_of_Amon_Ra"}]}
