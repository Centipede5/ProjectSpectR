Each card depicts a type of wrestling move, such as a suplex or clothesline, and the player can use them to counter and overpower their opponent. The game's story mode(s) plays out like a board game with occasional bouts.","collection":2988,"popularity":1,"games":[6685,65832,11588,60693,38284,28113,19083,76098,31559,6051],"tags":[27,268435460,268435470,268435472,536871146,536871262,536874083,536875183,536875190,536875361,536878439],"category":0,"keywords":[234,350,3171,4271,4278,4449,7527],"themes":[27],"genres":[4,14,16],"first_release_date":775094400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":775094400000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Jul-25","y":1994,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/izxu7zrreeh8va77hh5m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"izxu7zrreeh8va77hh5m","width":825,"height":1483}}
