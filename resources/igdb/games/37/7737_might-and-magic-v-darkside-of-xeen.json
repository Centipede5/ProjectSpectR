Based on the Might and Magic III: Isles of Terra game engine, it is the fifth game in the Might and Magic series, and is a direct sequel to Might and Magic IV: Clouds of Xeen, concluding the story arc started in the original Might and Magic Book One: The Secret of the Inner Sanctum. \n \nLike its predecessors, it was well received by both critics and players for its large game world and graphics, and was among the earliest games to make use of both animated cutscenes and PCM sound-based speech. Its unique integration mechanic with the game world of Clouds of Xeen, allowing both games to be played in a combined format - World of Xeen - was considered revolutionary at the time.","collection":43,"franchise":458,"franchises":[458],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,11567,1593,25300,6,11214,78,12632,76,370],"tags":[17,18,268435468,536871008,536871059,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871244,536871327,536871390,536871504,536871610,536871882,536871938,536872092,536872093,536872628,536872668,536873949,536874134,536874830,536875161,536875184,536875214,536875226,536875304,536875400,536875455,536875527,536875528,536875640,536875645,536875671,536875713,536875778,536875792,536875929,536876007,536876036,536876590,536878369,536878375,536878569,536879154,536879886,536880264,536880452,536880478,536880568,536882128,536882862,536882890,536883059,1073741825],"developers":[97],"publishers":[97],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[96,147,226,227,296,332,415,478,592,698,970,1026,1180,1181,1716,1756,3037,3222,3918,4249,4272,4302,4314,4392,4488,4543,4615,4616,4728,4733,4759,4801,4866,4880,5017,5095,5124,5678,7457,7463,7657,8242,8974,9352,9540,9566,9656,11216,11950,11978,12147],"themes":[17,18],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":757296000000,"platforms":[14,13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Might and Magic V\nMight and Magic 5","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Might and Magic V: Darkside of Xeen","comment":"Original release title"},{"name":"Might and Magic: Darkside of Xeen - La Face Cach\u00e9e de Xeen","comment":"French title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ziotgeeqskbgojhf12vx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ziotgeeqskbgojhf12vx","width":640,"height":847},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
