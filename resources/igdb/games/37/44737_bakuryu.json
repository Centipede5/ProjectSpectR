Kayaking and canoeing are also known as paddling. Kayaking is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is defined by the International Canoe Federation (the world sanctioning body) as a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. Most kayaks have closed decks, although \"sit-on-top\" kayaks are growing in popularity, as are inflatable kayaks which come without decks but which have air chambers surrounding the boat.","collection":1634,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[15830,79482,9648,27092,35994,43412,59218,5550,26553,26472],"tags":[268435470,268435471,268435487,536870990,536871006,536871270,536871758,536871818,536871851,536871938,536871939,536872098,536872673,536874694,536874834,536875057,536875071,536875318,536875361,536875523,536875525,536875762,536875767,536875896,536876232,536876924,536877263,536877624,536877646,536884449],"category":0,"keywords":[78,94,358,846,906,939,1026,1027,1186,1761,3782,3922,4145,4159,4406,4449,4611,4613,4850,4855,4984,5320,6012,6351,6712,6734,13537],"genres":[14,15,31],"first_release_date":969580800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":978220800000,"region":1,"human":"2000-Dec-31","y":2000,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":969580800000,"region":2,"human":"2000-Sep-22","y":2000,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":971481600000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Oct-14","y":2000,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Sakura Wars GB","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uy2oltghvwrhanakg9dc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uy2oltghvwrhanakg9dc","width":640,"height":629},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
