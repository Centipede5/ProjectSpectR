Players can trap magnets in a trap, while using traps on dust will reduce the dust and make it harmless. Be warned though, as magnets get free after a while or if they touch another trap after they are trapped.\n\nThere is also a timer. If the player does not use their traps on all the enemies within the time limit, they will die. If the player loses all three of their lives the game is then over. After each level the player gets to a bonus score screen, which shows how well they did within the time limit. The faster a player used their traps on all the enemies, the higher the bonus score multiplier.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36794,36608,34919,51485,22819,40524,51683,24199,23175,16468],"tags":[1,268435489,1073741828],"developers":[11017],"publishers":[11017],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":410140800000,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/heblmknzvhiy32lknigy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"heblmknzvhiy32lknigy","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"emo2hzxIgnU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/azjnizdywuhtvqrcu5is.jpg","cloudinary_id":"azjnizdywuhtvqrcu5is","width":800,"height":1215}}
