The game is based on Team Fortress Classic, but has been created entirely from scratch by the Fortress Forever development team. The intended scope of Fortress Forever is to please older Team Fortress Classic fans, while at the same time creating a game enjoyable enough to players new to Team Fortress styled games. \n \nFortress Forever was released on September 13, 2007.[1] The game is freely available to all who have a Steam account, as Team Fortress 2 is free for all and a Source game. As of May 24, 2013, Fortress Forever is on build 2.46. Version 2.46 now incorporates an auto-updater for future client updates. On October 16, 2013, FF has been 'greenlit' on Steam Greenlight, meaning the game will be on Steam (software) soon.[2] \n \nOn March 20, 2015, It was announced that Fortress Forever would be released for download on Steam on March 27, 2015 and they did release as planned.[3]","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28751,28029,76246,27314,10039,19341,68287,17446,29525,28552],"tags":[1,268435461,536871365,536873405,536876660,536876690,1073741825],"developers":[14152],"publishers":[14152],"game_engines":[3],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[453,2493,5748,5778],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1189641600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1189641600000,"human":"2007-Sep-13","y":2007,"m":9}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"nxDDV7Bt99I"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"A-V4u7LkP6Q"}],"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/253530\/Fortress_Forever"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/fortressforever"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fortressforever"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/fortressforever"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fortress_Forever"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/www.fortress-forever.com\/wiki\/"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.fortress-forever.com\/"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"onlinemax":22,"offlinemax":22}]}
