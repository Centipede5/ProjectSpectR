It's the first game that would look cool at a rave. Polarium is a simple, stylish puzzle game you play entirely with the Nintendo DS touch screen and a stylus. Draw lines to flip black and white tiles and make patterns and puzzles disappear. Use the stylus to draw a stroke, flipping black and white tiles to change and match their color. Three game modes and scores of puzzles will put your puzzle-solving abilities and stylus skills to the test. Challenge a friend to a duel over a wireless connection.","collection":917,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":76.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":76.6666666666667,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[55036,60044,32510,29173,79080,36553,77597,55590,9472,25222],"tags":[268435465,268435471,536872307,536873787,536874136,536874694,536878439,1073741827],"developers":[2830],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1395,2875,3224,3782,7527],"genres":[9,15],"first_release_date":1101945600000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1101945600000,"human":"2004-Dec-02","y":2004,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Chokkan hitofude"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/quebpemarsck9hdl7qup.jpg","cloudinary_id":"quebpemarsck9hdl7qup","width":256,"height":228},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
