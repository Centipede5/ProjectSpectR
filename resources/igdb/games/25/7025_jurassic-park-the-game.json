As players advance the storyline, a variety of sequences depict violent actions: characters getting attacked and\/or eaten by dinosaurs; a man getting shot by a gun-wielding mercenary; characters engaging in hand-to-hand combat with dinosaurs and other humans. Blood can sometimes be seen on dead bodies and characters' open wounds; a few sequences depict pools of blood on the ground. During the course of the game, some scenes contain suggestive dialogue (e.g., \u201cDid you guys make out?\u201d \u201cOscar, tell her the one about the priest, the stripper, and the bucket of frogs,\u201d and \u201cWhat, Mom didn't tell you I was stripping? . . . Also, I'm pregnant.\u201d). One man is occasionally depicted smoking a cigar; in one sequence, a teenager sneaks out to light a cigarette. The words \u201ca*s,\u201d \u201cb*tch,\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence -","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.telltalegames.com\/jurassicpark"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/201830"}],"external":{"steam":"201830"}}
