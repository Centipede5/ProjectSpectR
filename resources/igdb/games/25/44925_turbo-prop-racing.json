Now, Rapid Racer (Turbo Prop Racing in the United States) lets race speedboats. \n \nThe game offers several boats to choose from, and by winning races you can customize your speed, handling and acceleration. The game features six unique tracks filled with twists and turns. Each track is playable in three different modes: day, night and mirror. \n \nThere are also plenty of secrets to unlock. As you win races, new tracks and boats will appear, as well as a special fractal racing mode that generates random tracks. The time trial mode lets you race against a \"ghost\" boat, and you can save your best times to a memory card.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[40470,28856,54789,55192,36662,45101,19419,14857,25443,77793],"tags":[268435466,536874824,536875069,536875194,536875284,536877830,536883622,536884033],"category":0,"keywords":[3912,4157,4282,4372,6918,12710,13121],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":901756800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":901756800000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jul-30","y":1998,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Rapid Racer","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kmnvckhx76kqfzy8ix69.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kmnvckhx76kqfzy8ix69","width":1400,"height":1401}}
