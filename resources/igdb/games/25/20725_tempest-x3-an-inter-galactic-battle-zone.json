From the core of this void, fuseballs, rockets, pulsars, tankers and other hazardous aliens and alien artifacts move toward your ship. Once you clear a screen, you fly into the void and onto the next level. Watch out for spikes as you advance. \n \nThis game features three modes of play: Classic Tempest, which is based on the early 1980s Arcade smash simply titled Tempest; an update of Tempest called Tempest X, which features a jump feature, A.I. Droids that help you fight and enhanced graphics and sound; and Tempest Duel, which pits you against a friend and the Generator, which cranks out an endless source of enemies.","popularity":1,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":823132800000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":823132800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-01","y":1996,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iwfub8xd7nmiiijtoq3x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iwfub8xd7nmiiijtoq3x","width":1399,"height":1415}}
