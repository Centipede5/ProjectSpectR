Players mostly punch and kick opponents during fast-paced rounds of combat. Some fighters use special attacks involving swords, throwing weapons, or magic; matches are accompanied by battle cries and exaggerated impact effects. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, such as characters getting struck down with swords in slow motion. Most female fighters are dressed in revealing outfits (large amounts of cleavage); their breasts sometimes jiggle while standing or fighting. Some bikini-style costumes (with thin strips of cloth) barely cover fighters' bodies, exposing large amounts of breasts\/buttocks; one hologram-like figure appears to be nude\u2014though her reflective skin obscures any discernible details (i.e., nipples or genitalia). In some sequences, players have the ability to zoom in on female fighters' cleavage, posterior, or underwear, and take pictures. Some scenes are accompanied by sexual innuendo (e.g., \u201cPleasure me,\u201d \u201cEnough with the foreplay.\u201d).","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Nudity of a sexual nature\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/teamninja-studio.com\/doa5\/plus\/us\/top.html"}]}
