The development team released updates, called \"Deployments,\" nearly every month following launch. The game required a monthly subscription. \n \nTabula Rasa was about humanity's last stand against a group of aliens called the Bane. The story took place in the near future on two planets, Arieki and Foreas, which were in a state of constant conflict between the AFS (Allied Free Sentients) and the Bane. The term tabula rasa means \"clean slate\" in Latin, which refers to a fresh start, or starting over. \nAccording to the developers, the game included the ability for players to influence the outcome of a war between the player characters and the NPCs.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[103303,99118,103282,41042,112081,113910,111651,36929,113636,54775],"tags":[17],"developers":[13862],"publishers":[256],"category":0,"game_modes":[5],"themes":[17],"first_release_date":1193961600000,"status":5,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1193961600000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Nov-02","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1193961600000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Nov-02","y":2007,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/be3xvphn8ubyod7rsd28.jpg","cloudinary_id":"be3xvphn8ubyod7rsd28","width":480,"height":300}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"UDkm0IUW4II"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"yIRDqnnI3Bc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/blyjgxqjxjs2h01fa5yp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"blyjgxqjxjs2h01fa5yp","width":367,"height":515},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tabula_Rasa_(video_game)"}]}
