It is a quest for wonder, contemplation, and peace.","storyline":"You are a dead, failed video game character wandering through the recesses of the Random Access Memory, trying to find peace in the final moments of your existence before being deleted forever...\n\nWhat happens to dead video game characters?\n\nIn the garbage dump of the Random Access Memory, you travel from town to town, meeting people who offer you their lightning and their prayer. Lightning clears the way for you to move forward and prayer builds shelters in a distant town where you must frequently hide to avoid being deleted into nothingness by the garbage collector. Along the way, you are thrust into many battle challenges, the outcome of which affects your shelters. There is ultimately, no way to escape the garbage collector, but running from it buys you time to think, wander, contemplate, and hopefully be at peace with the inevitability of your deletion.\n\nEach game randomly assigns you 1 of the 6 characters and 6 of the 11 areas. There is no set order to the stages of the game.","rating":50,"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":65,"total_rating_count":2,"rating_count":1,"games":[25300,25311,27314,68287,47823,19448,19301,36950,59516,23175],"tags":[1,18,21,268435482,268435487,268435488,536871470,536871472,536871882,536871945,536872292,536873516,536875271,536875330,536875356,536875511,536875525,1073741829,1073741826],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[558,560,970,1033,1380,2604,4359,4418,4444,4599,4613],"themes":[1,18,21],"genres":[26,31,32],"first_release_date":1385856000000,"platforms":[6,39,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1385856000000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Dec-01","y":2013,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1388707200000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Jan-03","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1388707200000,"human":"2014-Jan-03","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1388707200000,"human":"2014-Jan-03","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1388707200000,"human":"2014-Jan-03","y":2014,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1388707200000,"human":"2014-Jan-03","y":2014,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Continue?9"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bjbfuyrsz9getyveyemq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bjbfuyrsz9getyveyemq","width":960,"height":539},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ievrxdmyegu3ivz3smxh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ievrxdmyegu3ivz3smxh","width":960,"height":555},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/odsledlrts7dk3afrhoo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"odsledlrts7dk3afrhoo","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kw3ewannwfit6rqhysdj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kw3ewannwfit6rqhysdj","width":960,"height":554},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yeq6bwicxqbjtrace3vf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yeq6bwicxqbjtrace3vf","width":960,"height":554}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"HRRBaWPFf70"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t5be0eiz8alniz4xdeed.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t5be0eiz8alniz4xdeed","width":410,"height":410},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/263340"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/continue9876543210.com"}],"external":{"steam":"263340"}}
