Game modes change according to the version, with the 16-bit versions including a \"Skins\" game, where each point is worth a sum of money based on the number of times the ball was hit.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[43618,56894,45477,22312,6763,47609,47601,44453,18144,81410],"tags":[268435470,536871223,536871641,536873715,536875176,536875177,536875186,536875766,536876534,536880415,536881357],"category":0,"keywords":[311,729,2803,4264,4265,4274,4854,5622,9503,10445],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dqiprxa81msq7wkijsf7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dqiprxa81msq7wkijsf7","width":554,"height":772}}
