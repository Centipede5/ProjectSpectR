As players move through abandoned buildings and deserted facilities, they shoot at several soldiers, aliens, and mutant dogs. Realistic guns and rifles are used to kill enemies from long range (periscope views on mutant dogs) and up-close (shots to soldiers' heads). Blood splatters from injured enemies and may pool on the ground; in one scene, a man writhing in pain on the floor can be shot dead. During the course of the game, players' character is able to drink alcohol and feel its effects: vision becomes blurry and foggy; the agent has trouble walking straight. Spoken dialogue contains profanity such as \"sh*t,\" \"c*cksucker,\" \"a*shole,\" and \"b*tch.\"","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.stalker-game.com\/"}]}
