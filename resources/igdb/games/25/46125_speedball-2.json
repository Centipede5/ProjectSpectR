As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses. \n \nYou can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,55715,40524,14713,23175,16468,1070,2940,68324],"tags":[1,268435470],"developers":[1714],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[64],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":64,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cr6iipp7ygfqdpfsmww8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cr6iipp7ygfqdpfsmww8","width":1530,"height":2100}}
