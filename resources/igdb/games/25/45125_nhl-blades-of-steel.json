Play with or against all of the teams in the NHL in the Exhibition mode, where you can get your bearings and learn winning tactics. Then, put those tactics to the test in the Season mode and try to win the Stanley Cup. If you don't like the ups and downs of Season play, go straight to the Playoffs. And when your friends question your dominance in the rink, go after them in the Two-Player link cable option. If the game ends in a tie, you will have to try to win it all in a shootout. No matter what mode you play, you must win the fights because if you lose, you go to the box. However, you can use the Practice mode to work on your fighting skills as well as your shootout technique.
