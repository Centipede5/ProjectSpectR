The Shinsengumi was formed to combat this rising tide of violence, and to protect the shogun and the people from dangerous ronin. \nAs the country inches close to all-out war, Chizuru travels to Kyoto to find her missing father. She encounters both danger and the Shinsengumi, in quick succession. After learning that the Shinsengumi are also looking for her father, Chizuru goes under their protection. However, they soon find themselves in the midst of political intrigue, supernatural power struggles, and much more as they search desperately for the answer they need.","collection":5548,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103054,37419,78632,34155,81249,80916,76736,103269,31712,90109],"tags":[1,22,268435460,268435487,1073741825],"publishers":[2103],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,22],"genres":[4,31],"first_release_date":1332374400000,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1332374400000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Mar-22","y":2012,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1363651200000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Mar-19","y":2013,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Hakuoki: Bakumatsu Musouroku","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1iku.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1iku","width":640,"height":1114},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Haku%C5%8Dki#Video_games"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/hakuouki.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bakumatsu_Musouroku"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.otomate.jp\/hakuoki_musouroku\/"}]}
