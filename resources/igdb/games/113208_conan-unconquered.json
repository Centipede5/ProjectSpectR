Wave after wave of increasingly more difficult enemies will rush at your gates and you will need to manage resources, research new technologies to advance your defenses, and recruit an ever-growing army if you are to save survive utter destruction. \n \nYou can choose to play the game entirely alone in single-player, but Conan Unconquered can also be enjoyed in full two-player co-op allowing for a truly unique, shared multiplayer experience. Players share a base, but both can freely construct new buildings and amass an army to reach their common goal. \n \nSimilar to games such as They Are Billions, the enemy hordes will keep coming at you and how long you can resist the invasion depends entirely on your ability to build your stronghold and lead your army. Gameplay is real-time, but you can also pause at any time to issue commands and start construction of new buildings. Battles will be bloody and savage with players having to deal with anything from fires raging through their stronghold to piles of corpses spreading death and disease. \n \nThe savage horde is at your gates. Will you fall or will you remain unconquered?\"","collection":3516,"franchise":3,"franchises":[3],"hypes":1,"popularity":1,"games":[55029,6414,2015,6985,28794,7889,79392,106859,14464,5613],"tags":[17,268435467,268435471,536872817,536873705,536874921,1073741827],"developers":[17051],"publishers":[458],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[1905,2793,4009],"themes":[17],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":1561852800000,"pulse_count":9,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":4,"platform":6,"date":1561852800000,"region":8,"human":"2019-Q2","y":2019,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbo","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbm","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rbk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rbk","width":1920,"height":1080}],"artworks":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar4lo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar4lo","width":2560,"height":853}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"aGC9uREas8o"}],"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/989690"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ConanUnconquerd"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ConanUnconquered"}],"external":{"steam":"989690"}}
