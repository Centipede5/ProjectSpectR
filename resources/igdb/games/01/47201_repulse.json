At the end of every stage (except for the first one), the player meets a huge enemy spaceship as the stage's boss. Player's spaceship is equipped with a limited force shield which allows it to resist any kind of attack, though energy drains both while its active and whenever the ship gets hit during. Power-ups are dropped by ally helicopters and spaceships, that bring to the player a new shot (much faster than the normal one) and refills his force field's meter.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103298,103281,91793,95340,49383,43951,41595,103301,47626,28029],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":476150400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":476150400000,"region":8,"human":"1985-Feb-02","y":1985,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"'99 : THE LAST WAR"}]}
