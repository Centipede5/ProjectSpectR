{"id":45601,"name":"Hokuto No Ken 2","slug":"hokuto-no-ken-2","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/hokuto-no-ken-2","created_at":1499511005039,"updated_at":1515667024171,"summary":"Hokuto no Ken 2 Seikimatsu Ky\u016bseishu Densetsu is a side-scrolling action game for the Family Computer released by Toei Animation on April 17, 1987. It served as a tie-in to the anime series of the same name, being released a few days after the airing of its fifth episode. A version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was released by Taxan in North America under the title of Fist of the North Star on April 1989, making it the earliest Hokuto no Ken tie-in product released outside Japan. Before release, the NES version was shown in the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in 1988 under the title of Ken the Great Bear Fist, Toei's proposed localized title for the series. \n \nBecause the game was produced at the same time as the Hokuto no Ken 2 anime series entered production, certain plot details differ from both, the manga and anime. Most notably, the renegade Gento K\u014d Ken masters from the anime, Taiga and Boltz, co-exists as enemy characters alongside Jak\u014d's sons from the manga, Jask and Sheeno, while Bronza, a character exclusive to this game, serves as the General of the Red Light in place of Shoki, who filled the same role in the anime. While Shoki himself never appears in the game, his death at the hands of Sheeno is acknowledged in the official strategy guide. The game only covers the Tentei story arc, with a bonus stage featuring the Nameless Asura as a hidden final boss.","storyline":"After the death of Raoh, the Central Imperial Capital began its rule of the chaotic world under the name of the Heavenly Emperor. Now grown up, Bat and Lin has formed a resistance under the banner of Hokuto. Kenshiro returns once again after hearing the plight of the people. Kenshiro must hurry to the Imperial Capital and defeat their leader Falco of the Gento K\u014d Ken style.","collection":3200,"franchise":1123,"franchises":[1123],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,76428,19565,103288,43465,55112,90101,64171,76723,2579],"tags":[1,18,268435460,268435464,536870926,536870973,536870981,536873299,536874038,536875053,536875054,536875073,536875222,536876712,1073741828],"developers":[1819],"publishers":[1996],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,61,69,2387,3126,4141,4142,4161,4310,5800],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4,8],"first_release_date":545616000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[51,18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":607392000000,"region":2,"human":"1989-Apr-01","y":1989,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":545616000000,"region":5,"human":"1987-Apr-17","y":1987,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Hokuto no Ken 2","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Hokuto no Ken II: Seikimatsu Kyuuseishu Densetsu","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u5317\u6597\u306e\u62f32 \u4e16\u7d00\u672b\u6551\u4e16\u4e3b\u4f1d\u8aac","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Hokuto no Ken 2 Seikimatsu Ky\u016bseishu Densetsu","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Fist of the North Star","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/syijui8dvyifzktmtwt0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"syijui8dvyifzktmtwt0","width":256,"height":352},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tnwatmf7tqtfiihnackh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tnwatmf7tqtfiihnackh","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nwuijj4rvmoty79vaxph.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nwuijj4rvmoty79vaxph","width":256,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w08mgyklmlctnarb6fv8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w08mgyklmlctnarb6fv8","width":512,"height":463},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gbxx9rwi1omvbgvr2yyb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gbxx9rwi1omvbgvr2yyb","width":256,"height":240}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xv7uhikexj7obaw8g7zk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xv7uhikexj7obaw8g7zk","width":1000,"height":691},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fist_of_the_North_Star_(NES_video_game)"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/hokuto.wikia.com\/wiki\/Hokuto_no_Ken_2_(Famicom)"}]}
