In addition, the game contains simulations of two complete Nicklaus-designed 18-hole courses: The Castle Pines Golf Club and The Golf Club at Desert Mountain. \nIt also bears the name and likeness of American professional golfer Jack Nicklaus. Less than two years before the game's publication, Nicklaus won the final major golf championship of his career: the 1986 Masters Tournament. Augusta National Golf Club hosted the tournament. Players can compete against Nicklaus as a computer opponent, or any of eight other computer opponents of varying skill levels. \nJack Nicklaus' Greatest 18 Holes of Major Championship Golf was a commercial success for Jack Nicklaus Productions and Accolade. The two companies developed it into a video game franchise, and Accolade published numerous adaptations and sequels for more than ten years.","collection":4184,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[102805,103218,44242,103377,101439,30830,106814,762,38967,96209],"tags":[32,268435469,268435470,536870942,536871673,536872078,536872179,536875054,536875139,536875140,536875626,536875627,536875824,1073741826],"developers":[387],"publishers":[4290,129,13692,547],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[30,761,1166,1267,4142,4227,4228,4714,4715,4912],"themes":[32],"genres":[13,14],"dlcs":[74888],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[63,86,115,14,13,16,121,125,15,25,18,27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":121,"date":620438400000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Aug-30","y":1989,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":125,"date":640656000000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Apr-21","y":1990,"m":4},{"category":2,"platform":27,"date":662601600000,"region":5,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":662601600000,"region":2,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":115,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":627868800000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Nov-24","y":1989,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":636249600000,"region":2,"human":"1990-Mar-01","y":1990,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Jack Nicklaus World Golf Tour","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Jack Nicklaus Turbo Golf","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Jack Nicklaus' Turbo Golf"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s3sktqgfvnyadjmkmphu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s3sktqgfvnyadjmkmphu","width":640,"height":911}}
