The player selects commands from a menu in order to talk to NPCs and solve puzzles which will eventually allow them to progress. As with many of these Famicom text adventures there is a linear critical path that the player must follow in order to move to new areas and reach the next point of the story. \n \nNankin refers to a semi-obscure manga artist of the same name who was behind much of the art design of the game. Though the game doesn't include any of his pre-existing licenses, his distinctive art style is present throughout. This approach might be equated to Akira Toriyama's artistic involvement with the Dragon Quest and Chrono games.","popularity":1,"games":[15911,22482,34053,59218,71590,59048,22210,61548,17906,26653],"tags":[27,268435487,536870990,536871262,536871939,536875222],"category":0,"keywords":[78,350,1027,4310],"themes":[27],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":597628800000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":597628800000,"region":5,"human":"1988-Dec-09","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":600307200000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Jan-09","y":1989,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d4ndrtamikbnkzddbj4n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d4ndrtamikbnkzddbj4n","width":300,"height":302}}
