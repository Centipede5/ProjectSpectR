He is equipped with the Red Queen sword, Blue Rose revolver, and the powers of his Devil Bringer. The Red Queen features an Exceed Gauge that can be charged up, allowing for subsequent attacks that are more powerful than regular slashes, until the gauge empties. Nero also has the powers of his Devil Bringer, and can use it to pull himself towards enemies or vice versa. The Devil Bringer may also be used for context-sensitive throw attacks, leading to high damage and various effects depending on the enemy. Nero's Devil Bringer also gains new abilities during the course of the game, such as being able to detect secret missions or caches of Red Orbs. Nero eventually gains the ability to use Devil Trigger after getting the katana known as Yamato, which increases his Devil Bringer's power, thus changing his Devil Bringer attacks into more powerful versions with different animations","collection":17,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"version_parent":112,"version_title":"Collector's Edition","games":[95340,76397,25311,103232,37419,31712,78632,81249,80916,35994],"tags":[1,268435471,268435487,1073741826],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[15,31],"first_release_date":1312761600000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1312761600000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Aug-08","y":2011,"m":8}]}
