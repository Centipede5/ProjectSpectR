You play a Troll roaming the levels in the hope of rescuing as many baby trolls as possible - each level gives you a set minimum to retrieve before you can leave via the Pigstop. \n \nInitially you have no weapons, and contact with the nasties costs you energy, but a Yo-Yo can be collected, which can be used not only to kill enemies, but also to smash blocks away and open up paths, and even (with practice) tied to a ledge to allow you to swing across a gap.","collection":4352,"franchise":646,"franchises":[646],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55752,63138,80767,80078,74416,65342,60588,58419,22153,74349],"tags":[268435464,536871208,536872961,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,2049],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[114,16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zoguwtakwe0mqo708q5j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zoguwtakwe0mqo708q5j","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zqzktborwhjb4lk4ut3d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zqzktborwhjb4lk4ut3d","width":640,"height":798}}
