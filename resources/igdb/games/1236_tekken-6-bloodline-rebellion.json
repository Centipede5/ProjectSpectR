It features new characters, stages, items and customization options. It also gives the game a balance update from characters and items. It was released to Japanese arcades on December 18, 2008 and the console version of Tekken 6 is based on this arcade version. \n \nThis new version features two new characters: Alisa Bosconovitch, an android with jet wings and spinning limbs who was built in the image of Dr. Bosconovitch's deceased daughter, and Lars Alexandersson, an unknown descendant of Heihachi Mishima and leader of a rebellious Tekken Force faction fighting Jin's tyranny. A number of new items and customization options are featured in this expansion. The game also features all-new CG character art, just as there was a change in art from Tekken 5 to Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection. Upgrade kits are also available for owners of current Tekken 6 machines.","collection":275,"rating":62.0854817954012,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":61.0427408977006,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":3,"games":[103269,10039,41828,1235,17548,103288,76921,76253,90101,76885],"tags":[1,268435460,536871019,1073741828],"developers":[248],"publishers":[248],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[107],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":1229558400000,"platforms":[52,9,38,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1229558400000,"human":"2008-Dec-18","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1256601600000,"human":"2009-Oct-27","y":2009,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1256601600000,"human":"2009-Oct-27","y":2009,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1259020800000,"human":"2009-Nov-24","y":2009,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u9244\u62f36 \u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3 \u30ea\u30d9\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hzzdvcjjpco7nzl7asms.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hzzdvcjjpco7nzl7asms","width":680,"height":384}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"bnHTn_3uKJI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wjmt759gntspltasuvud.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wjmt759gntspltasuvud","width":850,"height":1209},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tekken_6#Bloodline_Rebellion"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/tekken.wikia.com\/wiki\/Tekken_6%3A_Bloodline_Rebellion"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/Tekken.com"}]}
