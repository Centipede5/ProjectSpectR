Just like the Dynasty Warriors series, the aim of these expansions is solely to add more content to the game. Players can use the \"Import\" feature (through switching discs with the original game) to use all features of the original game. Without the original game disc, the player will only have access to the Xtreme Legends content. This offers four new characters (Imagawa Yoshimoto, Hashiba Hideyoshi, Honda Tadakatsu and Inahime) and a brand new mission and map. This also offers new weapons, items, skills, three new versus modes, a new survival mode, and fixes several problems. A new difficulty level, Novice is also added which is easier than Easy and targeted for beginners. Exclusive to Samurai Warriors Xtreme Legends, through the completion of special tasks, the player can earn Bonus Points in order to purchase special features. These features include additional costumes for characters, voice sound tests, lowering the difficulty required to unlock the fifth and sixth weapons and the ability to break the default limits for character's stats. Methods of earning bonus points include the following: earning all of a character's endings, unlocking rare items and weapons and successfully creating new characters.","collection":763,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[12571,6027,19631,7173,36952,1911,7242,19618,45014,7213],"tags":[1,17,22,268435481,536871139,536871165,536871301,536871460,536871535,536872098,536872205,536872352,536872443,536872444,536872449,536873370,536873473,536873591,536875067,536875073,536875300,536875304,536875403,536875406,536875419,536875456,536875923,536875944,536876027,536876121,536876266,536876286,536876849,536876908,536877301,536877406,536877628,536877908,536879786,536879800,536880112,536880120,536880121,536880231,536880287,536880800,536883461,536883556,536883834,536884456,1073741826],"developers":[1394],"publishers":[630],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[227,253,389,548,623,1186,1293,1440,1531,1532,1537,2458,2561,2679,4155,4161,4388,4392,4491,4494,4507,4544,5011,5032,5115,5209,5354,5374,5937,5996,6389,6494,6716,6996,8874,8888,9200,9208,9209,9319,9375,9888,12549,12644,12922,13544],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[25],"first_release_date":1095292800000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1095292800000,"region":5,"human":"2004-Sep-16","y":2004,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1099958400000,"region":2,"human":"2004-Nov-09","y":2004,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1109289600000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Feb-25","y":2005,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u6226\u56fd\u7121\u53cc \u731b\u5c06\u4f1d","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vlxcsgiwehnkebmx2jeq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlxcsgiwehnkebmx2jeq","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ki5mjnifooyr0wi4unno.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ki5mjnifooyr0wi4unno","width":1524,"height":2156},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
