It's made by some of the guys who went on to form Open Corp (the team that made Buzz & Waldog), and that game's DNA is really obviously present in this one - those same sound effects ripped off from Tiny Toon Adventures, a similar aesthetic, etc. In a lot of ways this game is simpler, but in many others it's actually a way more ambitious game, complete with a shop system, minigames, lots of character upgrades, etc. The ROM size is even twice that of Buzz & Waldog!","popularity":1,"games":[1070,41118,38305,1073,1188,89495,51942,51247,51203,50992],"tags":[268435464],"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":717897600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":717897600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Oct-01","y":1992,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uya7ktlqjvrstueb9xt6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uya7ktlqjvrstueb9xt6","width":1391,"height":1701}}
