{"id":49898,"name":"Chase H.Q.: Secret Police","slug":"chase-h-dot-q-secret-police","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/chase-h-dot-q-secret-police","created_at":1500034154963,"updated_at":1515582501373,"summary":"The chase is on in CHASE HQ: Secret Police for the Game Boy Color. Loosely adapted from the arcade game of the same name, CHASE HQ is a unique mix of racing and action for one or two players. In the One-Player mode, you'll lead a handpicked team of undercover cops, each with unique talents. You'll be shown what kind of vehicle the suspect is driving, and then you'll hit the streets to find him. When you finally locate the perp, you'll switch to a behind-the-vehicle view as you try to shoot or bump the criminal off the road. Once you've managed to lower their life-bar far enough, they'll pull over and you'll make the arrest. There are 10 levels of single-player action, so you'll be plenty busy as you try to collar the criminals. You can also grab a friend to play Head-to-Head using a link cable, with one person playing the cop and the other playing the bad guy.","collection":4794,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,36662,40470,34919,36608,16468,54789,23175,59516,28029],"tags":[1,268435466,536875069,536875090,536875282,536878439,536879184],"category":0,"keywords":[4157,4178,4370,7527,8272],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":962323200000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":962323200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jun-30","y":2000,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dr5cmjjggw5aikvc9bp8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dr5cmjjggw5aikvc9bp8","width":640,"height":636},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
