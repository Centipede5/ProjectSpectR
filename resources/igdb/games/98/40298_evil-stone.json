It's a beat em up, but rather than taking place on a traditional scrolling path, it takes place on grids of floating rocks. Furthermore, it's a beat em up in which the player has no kind of health counter, and can theoretically take an endless number of hits without dying.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":644198400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":644198400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Jun-01","y":1990,"m":6}]}
