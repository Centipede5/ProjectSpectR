The game is designed as an introduction to the Army for young adults who are considering career options. Players handle several realistic weapons, shoot at targets and enemies, and treat an assortment of combat injuries (bleeding, gunshot wounds, collapsed lungs, etc.). While combat scenarios are highly tactical, they can also involve frenetic firefights with realistic gunfire. Enemy soldiers emit brief puffs of blood when hit.\r\n\r\nOnline Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.americasarmy.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/13140"},{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AmericasArmy"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AmericasArmy"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/americasarmygame"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/America's_Army#America.27s_Army_3_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/gaming.wikia.com\/wiki\/America's_Army"}],"external":{"steam":"13140"}}
