Teke! Asmik-kun World), this game was never released outside Japan. Like its predecessor, the game is an excellent example of the trap-em-up genre, which also includes games like Heiankyo Alien and Space Panic. \n \nIn the game, Asmik-kun has to build a \"road\" from the entrance to the exit in each level. An enemy has come to kidnap the children on a certain world and the \"roads\" are intended for the children to be rescued and escorted safely back home.[3]","collection":1054,"popularity":1,"games":[60044,25222,25646,14047,36608,34919,26223,56292,78222,70937],"tags":[1,268435465,536873787],"developers":[3672],"publishers":[1850],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[2875],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":675043200000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":675043200000,"region":5,"human":"1991-May-24","y":1991,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30a2\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u304f\u3093 \u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9 2","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uvi4rhco6ovx1xpyyw3w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uvi4rhco6ovx1xpyyw3w","width":220,"height":257}}
