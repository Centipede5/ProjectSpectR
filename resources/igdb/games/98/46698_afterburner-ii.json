It is the second game in the After Burner series. In the game, players fly a F-14 Tomcat jet fighter, gunning down enemies while avoiding incoming fire. Like OutRun, another Sega arcade game, After Burner II came in several versions, the most famous being a large, servo actuated, sit-down cabinet which resembled a cockpit and moved according to the motion of the plane onscreen. The cockpit would bank in the same direction the on-screen aircraft was banking. There was also a more basic upright cabinet version. \n \nAfter Burner II has been translated and ported to numerous home computers, consoles and mobile phones; including versions for the PC Engine, Sharp X68000, Sega Mega Drive, Famicom, FM Towns Marty, Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and Sega Saturn. In Japan, it was released on the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages classic series. Mega placed the Mega Drive version at #38 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. MegaTech magazine praised the smooth and fast gameplay, as well as the sound.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"developers":[830],"publishers":[4468],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":602294400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":602294400000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Feb-01","y":1989,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m5g4msosejomu2d5tkxl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m5g4msosejomu2d5tkxl","width":320,"height":256}}
