It\u2019s time to back the mad scientist for a change! \n \nSo, man the maniac\u2019s super-tank and thunder through twenty all -action missions, spreading mayhem and carnage. Your tasks will range from seek-and-find missions to all out assaults, from espionage to dramatic defenses. With dozens of weapons at your disposal, you\u2019ll be fighting against everything from helicopters to infantry, armored cars to enemy tanks, fortifications to biomechs. \n \nThe environments have been set up to be non-linear and entirely interactive. Drive where-ever you wish, crushing trees and blasting the wildlife, trashing skyscrapers, leaving tank-tracks and the bloody remains of your foes in the sand. The pyrotechnics aren\u2019t just limited to big explosions (though there are plenty of those), as flamethrowers leave trees ablaze and foes running screaming as they burn.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1006732800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1006732800000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Nov-26","y":2001,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/izsufskpravoea10upex.jpg","cloudinary_id":"izsufskpravoea10upex","width":1531,"height":2167}}
