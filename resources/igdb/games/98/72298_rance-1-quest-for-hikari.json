{"id":72298,"name":"Rance 1 - Quest for Hikari","slug":"rance-1-quest-for-hikari","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/rance-1-quest-for-hikari","created_at":1506692620266,"updated_at":1541141390770,"summary":"The story is pretty simple - Hikari (\"Light\"), the red haired girl that you see in an opening clip, has been kidnapped. And Rance get the mission from his boss (the bald guy) to investigate the case. \n \nRance is something like a detective in this story. This also turns the whole game more into a detective-like exploring than into rpg or more less rpg\/strategy to which the gamers of the latter games of the series are used to. Rance isn\u2019t alone in his job as he has a helper - 16 year old Sill. She's actually Rance's slave. She was from a rich family but later got kidnapped by some bandit and then auctioned as a slave. The one who bought her was of course Rance. \n \nNow with her help you (Rance) have to solve this mystery, bring Hikari back and pay back to the ones at fault.","storyline":"Keith, owner of Keith's Guild, offers Rance a job worth 20,000 gold in reward from the Bran family to find and protect their daughter, Hikari Mi Bran, who was kidnapped with no subsequent demands made. Assisting him in his search is Zeth-born caster slave, Sill Plain, who was also kidnapped from her rich family and sold to Rance in exchange for his life savings. Through separate means, they both work together to solve the mystery behind the kidnapping, and eventually discover that the case is much larger than it seemed to be.","collection":2786,"popularity":2,"games":[59218,22490,22482,22425,59048,17906,74368,68049,58814,28309],"tags":[42,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871255,536871759,536871938,536871939,536872626,536877297,536878208],"developers":[12940],"publishers":[12940],"category":0,"keywords":[78,343,847,1026,1027,1714,6385,7296],"themes":[42],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9 -\u5149\u3092\u3082\u3068\u3081\u3066-","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Rance: Hikari Quest","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Rance: Hikari o Motomete","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jhx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jhx","width":640,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5jhw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5jhw","width":640,"height":400}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g4yi0zami3vr5jebqqf7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g4yi0zami3vr5jebqqf7","width":256,"height":372}}
