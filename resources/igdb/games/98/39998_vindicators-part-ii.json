Only approximately 400 units were made. There are only a few minor differences as the gameplay is nearly identical to the first, even keeping 10 of the 14 original stations of the first Vindicators. It even keeps the old graphics, music and sound. Though the in-game voice was changed to a less robotic sounding male, and several tank upgrades were added that are picked up as powerups and expire after a level is finished.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,68279,28029,78613,78518,77810,77744,72649,67681,65649],"tags":[268435461,536871937],"category":0,"keywords":[1025],"genres":[5]}
