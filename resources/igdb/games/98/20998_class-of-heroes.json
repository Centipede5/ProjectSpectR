What were they created for? \n \nThe answer still eludes us. \nWhat we do know, is that the mysterious labyrinths appeared \ndecades ago, and with them, the world was changed forever. \nTheir true form unknown and ever-changing, they sprawl across \nthe world like a web, connecting towns and villages, mountains, \nlakes, and deserts. \n \nMany adventurers delved into these labyrinths dreaming of \nriches, and those fortunate enough to return did so with tales \nand treasures untold. It was only natural that the children of our \nworld began to look upon these heroes with their unconditional \nadmiration. And as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of \nflattery. \n \nHere at our campus, we strive to equip young men and \nwomen with the tools they\u2019ll need to become full-fledged adventurers. \nTo all the bright-eyed students stepping through our gates for \ntheir first term: Welcome. We hope your studies here are as \nenriching and productive as you\u2019ve dreamed they would be. \n \n-Principal Feinman","collection":2287,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[20073,76397,49414,103282,104236,103303,25636,103020,59427,51213],"tags":[268435468,536872509,536888348,536888363,536893411,536893412],"category":0,"keywords":[1597,17436,17451,22499,22500],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1247097600000,"pulse_count":6,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1247097600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Jul-09","y":2009,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hqcemboode7fqsaaunof.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hqcemboode7fqsaaunof","width":172,"height":294}}
