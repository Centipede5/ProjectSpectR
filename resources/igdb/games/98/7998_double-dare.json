Like the TV show, the game is basically a trivia game with the added enhancement of being able to answer the question, or take a dare. Dares consist of the Toss-up Challenge, the Physical Challenge, and in the last round, the Obstacle Course. Questions are varied, and in large enough number to avoid excessive repetition even over several games worth of play.","collection":3138,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[27266,19222,41348,8197,25222,25646,236,27725,10225,60044],"tags":[268435465,268435489,536871602,536871684],"developers":[771],"publishers":[1019],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[299,690,772,1761,2601,3782,4228,4324,4379,4774,5932,6393,6396],"genres":[9,14,15,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[13,18],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":662601600000,"region":2,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":18,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hwqkekmch2z7wzj1cr2m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hwqkekmch2z7wzj1cr2m","width":157,"height":220}}
