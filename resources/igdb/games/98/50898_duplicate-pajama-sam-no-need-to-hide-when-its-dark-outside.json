Journeying into his closet with his purple Pajama Sam mask, Signature-Edition, All-Metal Pajama Man Lunch Box (often known as the Portable Bad Guy Containment Unit), and his Illuminator Mark 5 Jr. Flashlight, Sam tumbles down into the Land of Darkness and is soon stopped by a group of trees acting as customs. After freeing himself, Sam goes on an adventure to reclaim his lost equipment. He befriends a boat named Otto and a mine cart named King, who help Sam throughout his exciting search. After a quest spanning a river, a lava-filled mine, and Darkness's house, Sam goes to confront Darkness.","popularity":1,"games":[14605,43130,44591,17469,23175,28277,27266,63734,72412,63718],"tags":[268435487,536872006],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":849571200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":849571200000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Dec-03","y":1996,"m":12}]}
