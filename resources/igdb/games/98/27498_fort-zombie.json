The game takes place on a version of Earth that is being invaded by an evil force which warps reality and creates zombies. Players control Ben Riley,[2][3] a young man who has survived through the destruction and is setting up a safe haven in the fictional town of Piety, Indiana[1]. Each version of Piety in any play-through is procedurally generated, with different houses, items and enemies placed each time the player enters the town.[4] Players must choose a location to fortify, build defenses and find supplies and survivors in thirteen in-game days before a zombie horde pours out of Indianapolis and overwhelms the survivors. The game began as a test for technology to be used in the upcoming game Northstar and uses a similar engine.[4]","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[44076,7329,25646,26192,47823,36926,29525,25300,37088,6036],"tags":[1,19,20,33,268435461,268435468,536870981,536871938,536872032,536875887,536877292,536880294],"developers":[963],"publishers":[517],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,1026,1120,4975,6380,9382],"themes":[1,19,20,33],"genres":[5,12],"first_release_date":1256860800000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1256860800000,"human":"2009-Oct-30","y":2009,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jpfrvb3eqhnwmyi6udnk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jpfrvb3eqhnwmyi6udnk","width":374,"height":525}}
