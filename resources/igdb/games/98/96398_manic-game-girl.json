There was trouble with the games development as the market for video games was just starting in South Korea which lead to a lack of people with experience making games at the time. \n \nThe game was released at the end of the PlayStation's production cycle after the launch of the PlayStation 2 earlier in the year. This was reflected in it's marketing at the time which mentions how it will run just as well on the newer system. \n \nThere were plans to release the game internationally by the end of the year with the North American publisher Conspiracy Entertainment but that was eventually canceled.","storyline":"Edited google translation of the story summary: \n\"Amber, a collage student, is selected as a beta tester for 'Game Stealth', a new portable game machine.
