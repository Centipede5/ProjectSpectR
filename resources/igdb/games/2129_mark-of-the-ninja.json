As players traverse through side-scrolling levels, they use various ninja weapons (e.g., swords, shuriken, darts, spiked mines) to kill human soldiers in hand-to-hand combat; some attacks trigger zoomed-in camera angles, and slashing\/gushing sounds can be heard as enemies are stabbed or impaled. Stealth is a primary game mechanic, and players can execute various attack moves to avoid detection (e.g., descending from above to slice enemies' throats). Though combat and cutscenes are stylized and cartoonlike, kills are accompanied by exaggerated splashes of bright red blood. Cut scenes also depict acts of violence: a guard getting chopped in half; a villain impaling himself with a sword as blood pools underneath him. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.markoftheninja.com"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mark_of_the_Ninja"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/markoftheninja.wikia.com\/wiki\/Main_Page"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/214560"}],"external":{"steam":"214560"}}
