Players' goal is to make their chosen company successful by trading from different ports, conquering certain ports, and engaging in naval battles with rival companies or pirates. During the naval battles, players can issue commands (e.g., fire canons, retreat, and attack vessels) from the deck level of their ship as the camera zooms in to track the constant cannon fire. Realistic sound effects include screams of pain, explosions, and shattering wood from the ship. The game logo in the menu screen depicts a pile of coins with red blood splattered over them.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.eic-game.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/25930"}],"external":{"steam":"25930"}}
