{"id":39413,"name":"Dark Edge","slug":"dark-edge","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/dark-edge","created_at":1498127344993,"updated_at":1516742500936,"summary":"Dark Edge is a 1992 fighting game by Sega for the Sega System 32. It uses sprite scaling to simulate a 3D playfield, meaning it predates Virtua Fighter as a 3D fighter by about a year (though the 3D in Virtua Fighter isn't simulated, but rather true rendered 3D graphics). You can play as either warriors or monsters, but otherwise this is a typical fighting game with a dedicated jump button (as Up moves back). Although the title screen reads \"1992\", the arcade game was first sold in early 1993.","popularity":1,"games":[19448,36911,26766,14362,68287,25300,2558,36950,71455,7329],"tags":[18,268435460,536870973,536871019,536871501,536871882,536871969,536872098,536875052,536875057,536875075,536875081,536875198,536875931,536876816,536877448,536877551,536878436],"category":0,"keywords":[61,107,589,970,1057,1186,4140,4145,4163,4169,4286,5019,5904,6536,6639,7524],"themes":[18],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sgqxkdd7elejirsa8btd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sgqxkdd7elejirsa8btd","width":850,"height":1187}}
