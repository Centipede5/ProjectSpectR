While twisting the joystick's head to the left or right controls the engine throttle, the stick movement itself is used to shift gears in a realistic H-pattern. \n \nDepending on the chosen skill level, the car available is a family sedan, a modified sedan, a funny car, or a real dragster, although they all look the same on screen. One player can try to beat the predefined par time of 7.7 seconds, or compete against a friend to see who reaches the finish line first. The game manual mentions that a player only wins the game when he brings his victory counter to 99.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55192,40470,23314,28856,18699,83217,82502,80729,80382,80309],"tags":[268435466,536875069,1073741827],"developers":[9372],"publishers":[9372],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[4157],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":236563200000,"platforms":[127],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":127,"date":236563200000,"region":2,"human":"1977-Jul-01","y":1977,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Videocart 7 - Autorennen"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c6lcuyuprnnhffvgnrhh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c6lcuyuprnnhffvgnrhh","width":958,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"8ZXrEWdy3YM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f69bzzjo02hck4bx1pfl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f69bzzjo02hck4bx1pfl","width":339,"height":462}}
