Tenchu is known for its stealth gameplay and the eerie settings of feudal Japan.\n\nTenchu was one of the first ninja games to incorporate stealth, a very crucial aspect of ninjutsu. However, aside from featuring traditional martial arts in battles, the game incorporates elements of historical fantasy and Japanese mythology. The game also used motion capture where actor\/martial artist Sho Kosugi and his son Kane, were hired as actors for the game's combat moves.","storyline":"The game takes place in feudal Japan, introducing a pair of ninja: Rikimaru (\u529b\u4e38) and Ayame (\u5f69\u5973), members of the Azuma ninja clan since childhood.
