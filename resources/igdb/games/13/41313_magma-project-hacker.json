The player character uses a robotic fighter to hunt for clues behind a global conspiracy. \n \nMagma Project Hacker is a sci-fi themed RPG and an adaptation of the 1985 PC\/Amiga\/Atari ST strategy game Hacker. As with the Famicom Disk System adaptation of Monty on the Run, a considerable number of liberties were taken with the game's themes practically transforming it into a completely different game. Ironically, the story more closely resembles another western PC game, Captive, with its plot. \n \nThe player character witnesses a murder and is told to seek information on a shadowy organization known as the Magma Project by the dying victim. In order to effectively hunt for clues, the player character uses a device to activate a robot on the other side of the planet and employs the robot's various combat and exploration functions to track down the Magma Project.","collection":2533,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55038,36950,25300,1877,18290,36929,25311,17130,90099,27405],"tags":[18,268435468,536870979,536871882,536871938,536872335,536872550,536872581],"category":0,"keywords":[67,970,1026,1423,1638,1669],"themes":[18],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":618710400000,"platforms":[51,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":51,"date":618710400000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Aug-10","y":1989,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":621388800000,"region":8,"human":"1989-Sep-10","y":1989,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ncyp1r4x6niao8avulfr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ncyp1r4x6niao8avulfr","width":248,"height":294}}
