{"id":40413,"name":"Schmeiser Robo","slug":"schmeiser-robo","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/schmeiser-robo","created_at":1498479687139,"updated_at":1500240061597,"summary":"Schmeiser Robo plays similarly to other 2D versus fighting games during its release, which the player's character fights against his or her opponent in best two-out-of-three matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player. However, unlike most other fighting games released at the same time, the game uses an 8-way joystick and 3 buttons: one for punching, another for kicking, and the last one first introduced in the game during the modern era of fighting games, the guard button. Every character can do moving and attacking in spite of repeatedly pressing the guard button; however, they can\u2019t block their opponents' attacks by using it. Other unique features introduced in this game are quick (or small) jumping, air-guarding, counter-attacking, guard-canceling and rush-attacking.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[75962,46815,75964,75858,75857,75853,68609,55058,50726,50704],"tags":[268435460],"category":0,"genres":[4],"first_release_date":738892800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":738892800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Jun-01","y":1993,"m":6}]}
