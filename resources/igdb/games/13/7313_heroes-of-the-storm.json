Players form teams of five and compete to destroy opponents' bases. Gameplay is presented from a pulled-back, overhead perspective, as humans and fantasy creatures use swords, arrows, tanks, firearms, and magical attacks to defeat opponents in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by cries of pain and impact sounds; brownish blood puffs appear when heroes are slain. A handful of female characters wear low-cut tops that reveal large amounts of cleavage. Characters sometimes engage in suggestive dialogue\/innuendo: \u201c[M]y swords are bigger than yours\u2026 Oh, come now, don't be ashamed! It happens to a LOT of men.\u201d During the course of the game, a handful of characters discuss flatulence, emit flatulence, vomit, or emit large pools of \u201cPutrid Bile.\u201d The words \u201cb*tch\u201d and \u201ca*s\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/us.battle.net\/heroes\/en\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heroes_of_the_Storm"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/heroesofthestorm.gamepedia.com\/Heroes_of_the_Storm_Wiki"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/BlizzHeroes\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/BlizzHeroes"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":5,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
