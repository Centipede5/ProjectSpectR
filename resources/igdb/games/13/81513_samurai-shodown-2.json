Unlike its predecessor, it was released on the Neo-Geo Pocket Color system, so its graphics were no longer monochrome. \n \nIt was designed as a conversion from the most recent game in the Samurai Shodown series, Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage, and almost all of its story events, endings and cutscenes are derived from its arcade cousin. Almost all of the characters from Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage are included (the sole exception being Hanma Yagyu). It also re-added two series favorites who were not in the arcade, Charlotte and Yagyu Jubei.","hypes":1,"popularity":1,"category":0,"first_release_date":925430400000,"platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":120,"date":925430400000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Apr-30","y":1999,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hl4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hl4","width":800,"height":784},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Samurai_Shodown!_2"}]}
