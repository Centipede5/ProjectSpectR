The game was originally developed as part of a tie-in with the movie The Last Starfighter, which featured an arcade game of the same name as part of its plotline. Versions for the Atari 5200 and the Atari 8-bit computers were developed in 1984, although those were never released. Later the tie-in was dropped, and the game converted into a sequel to Star Raiders by changing a number of gameplay elements. The gameplay remained quite different from the original Star Raiders.","collection":2710,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,71455,27314,25300,142,76246,76722],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871882,1073741825],"developers":[190],"publishers":[7405,190],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[970],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[65,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"The Last Starfighter","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Star Raiders 2","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xqqdte3akxbubepo36p5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xqqdte3akxbubepo36p5","width":1000,"height":791}}
