Players control the eponymous bear as they use various things to earn \"nasty Points\", with extra points being given for random missions.[1] \n \nThe game is set on a paradisal island where teddy bears live in harmony. The main character, Naughty Bear, is a shabby teddy bear who has a tendency to be mischievous, which earns him the dislike of the other bears. Like the other teddy bears, he does not speak but instead conveys his emotions through a variety of sounds and facial expressions. His actions are influenced by an unseen narrator with a demeanor reminiscent of that of a young children's television show host.[2][3]","popularity":1.666666666666667,"version_parent":2633,"version_title":"Gold Edition","games":[37419,103298,2940,103281,36608,20068,76253,103282,103020,90108],"tags":[1,536873810,536888127,536891845,536891846],"category":0,"keywords":[2898,17215,20933,20934],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1308873600000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1308873600000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Jun-24","y":2011,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zmfacle1cid063lyuvxa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zmfacle1cid063lyuvxa","width":358,"height":500}]}
