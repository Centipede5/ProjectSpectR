The title features a selection of virtual tables, all themed after Mike Myers's original Austin Powers film. Characters such Vanessa Kensington, the Fembots, and even Mini-Me also make appearances. \n \nFrom the makers of Balls of Steel and Devil's Island Pinball comes this title based on the popular Austin Powers movies. \n \nTwo tables are included - one based on International Man of Mystery, and the other based on The Spy Who Shagged Me. Tables can be played in either full-screen or scrolling mode. Sound effects and dot-matrix animations are taken from the movies, while the music is merely in the same style. And here comes the obligatory tagline - groovy baby, yeah!","collection":5057,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[61548,51464,61160,34053,37205,4333,57116,18357,80827,65062],"tags":[27,268435486,536871262,536871846,536875054,536875140,536875368,536875412,536876694],"category":0,"keywords":[350,934,4142,4228,4456,4500,5782],"themes":[27],"genres":[30],"first_release_date":1038182400000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":1038182400000,"region":8,"human":"2002-Nov-25","y":2002,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bqyafzhgg3ewxzj6pwle.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bqyafzhgg3ewxzj6pwle","width":1412,"height":1415},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
