{"id":42085,"name":"Bikkuri Man World","slug":"bikkuri-man-world","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/bikkuri-man-world","created_at":1499068184432,"updated_at":1500615146302,"summary":"Despite being Hudson\u2019s Vol.2, this was in fact released almost a month before The Kung Fu. It\u2019s a conversion of what most people know as Wonder Boy in Monster Land, and it\u2019s as perfect a conversion as you\u2019re likely to get. This game takes a different pace from the first Wonder Boy game, being more of an adventure with a slower pace and more strategy. You start the game with barely a thread on and are given a sword by some wise looking dude who lives in a tree - so far so good. It is then your task to travel through the various platform-based levels defeating monsters and evil bosses along the way. Each enemy you kill leaves behind a coin or money bag (these are also at various hidden locations if you jump at the right spot) and shops will offer you armour, shields, weaponry and go-faster shoes. You can also pop into a bar and top up your energy if you can afford it. Levels are time limited (shown by an egg-timer on the left) so you need to be quick, or energy is taken away from your heart meter.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1070,1073,1188,10039,36608,74863,1066,34919,51485,26848],"tags":[1,268435464],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":565228800000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":565228800000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Nov-30","y":1987,"m":11}]}
