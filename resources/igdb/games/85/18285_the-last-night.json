In tricky situations, run away, argue to gain more time, or try to pull your gun. \n+ Living, simulated world with dense crowd of citizens doing their own stuff.","storyline":"The soul of a cinematic platformer and the heart of a sci-fi thriller, The Last Night is set in a post-cyberpunk world with a deep, vibrant vision of the future. \n \nThe Last Night is what we call post-cyberpunk \u2013 it\u2019s not the kind of dystopia the genre is famous for, rather it depicts an alternate direction for society. One where the fight for survival doesn\u2019t mean food and water, but a purpose for living. Human labour and creativity has been rendered obsolete by AI, so people are now defining themselves by what they consume, not what they create. \n \nCharlie is a lower-class citizen who can\u2019t interface with the systems and augmentations of the world around him, due to an accident during his childhood. He\u2019s a citizen of the thriving metropolis and yet he\u2019ll never be a part of it. Then, a chance encounter offers him the chance to be part of something else and take matters into his own hands.","hypes":56,"popularity":111,"games":[36950,25311,29032,37419,105269,55173,28070,80916,27316,33269],"tags":[1,18,268435464,268435487,268435488,536871015,536872617,536872970,536873159,536875136,536875269,1073741828],"developers":[9376],"publishers":[7079],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[103,1705,2058,2247,4224,4357],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[8,31,32],"first_release_date":1553990400000,"pulse_count":25,"platforms":[6,14,49,3],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":49,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":3,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":14,"human":"TBD"},{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dhyxqxe1plqic24uqmqi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dhyxqxe1plqic24uqmqi","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/paaln5r2kbddtpm6m6qt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"paaln5r2kbddtpm6m6qt","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iuftef411lebikx3zpaz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iuftef411lebikx3zpaz","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rervzhv632ncltdjfkvp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rervzhv632ncltdjfkvp","width":1280,"height":534},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/siycxh8mov9ity26eztg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"siycxh8mov9ity26eztg","width":1275,"height":532}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"pupdeq1MoVw"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"vZw1WjnIN8M"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pthhjyke7ou64ufq9ok1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pthhjyke7ou64ufq9ok1","width":756,"height":1080},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Last_Night_(video_game)"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/rawfury.com\/games\/the-last-night\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/612400"}],"external":{"steam":"612400"}}
