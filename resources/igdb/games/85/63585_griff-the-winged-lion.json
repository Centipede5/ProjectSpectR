We have many favorites on the original Playstation and N64 and aim to honor mid-to-late 90's mascots we grew up with such as Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon while bringing our own unique elements to the table. We can't compare Griff to the greats, but we can make a fun tribute with its own heart and soul. If you love the simple charm of early 3D, then jump on board my radical friend, because things are about to get old-school!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wtnvowbuvzreaj9cylz5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wtnvowbuvzreaj9cylz5","width":268,"height":268}}
