Players can climb into the cockpit of an F-14 Super Tomcat, an F-15E Strike Eagle, or an F\/A-19E Super Hornet and speed through the skies, dodging planes, rockets, and bullets while try to target and take down as many enemies as possible. A branching storyline and time limits force gamers into split-second decisions, but once the \"Climax Gauge\" is full, time slows down momentarily to let pilots unleash a screen-clearing fusillade of bullets.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":73.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":73.3333333333333,"total_rating_count":4,"games":[37419,87728,34919,25311,44242,19341,76263,103341,15851,58597],"tags":[1,268435469,268435489,536871783,536888127,536893085,536893086],"category":0,"keywords":[871,17215,22173,22174],"themes":[1],"genres":[13,33],"first_release_date":1164931200000,"platforms":[52,9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1271808000000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Apr-21","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1303257600000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Apr-20","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1303171200000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Apr-19","y":2011,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":1164931200000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Dec-01","y":2006,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x7xmp7funlbjqe3dwlmi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x7xmp7funlbjqe3dwlmi","width":432,"height":324}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ignfbsxme50w9fkcw2s7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ignfbsxme50w9fkcw2s7","width":850,"height":1192}}
