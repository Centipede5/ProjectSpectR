Tasked with exploring the minds of five young men and women who were found scared, screaming, and without memory, he makes alarming discoveries as he begins to cautiously explore the psyches of his young patients. Throughout the game, players will switch between six different characters in this chilling interactive psycho thriller.","storyline":"The game begins when five amnesic college-aged teens suddenly appear with guns in the middle of New York City. Psychiatrist David McNamara from DC is sent to examine the case thanks to his previous work in the US Army dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder. Right from the beginning, the case seems odd. On the first day, David discovers that all five patients had the same origins, and they were escaping from the same unknown person from an isolated military island. As the history is revealed, David, using a PDA as a tape recorder, makes his way through the teens' minds, piecing together their history, while at the same time dealing with his ongoing divorce. David himself has serious issues regarding anger management, which ended his former relationship. \n \nIt is revealed in the end that the teens were part of a military experiment for making amnesic assassins, and David's anger issues were only side effects of the previous project back in the Army.","rating":50,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":72.5,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":61.25,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":3,"games":[37419,29032,80916,33269,28070,31712,10039,25311,102178,79999],"tags":[1,43,268435458,268435487,268435488,536871475,536872313,536877515,536879897,536881346,536890804,1073741826],"developers":[9319],"publishers":[2301,2129,2224,6987,962,10075],"game_engines":[319],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[563,1401,6603,8985,10434,19892],"themes":[1,43],"genres":[2,31,32],"first_release_date":1192147200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1192147200000,"region":8,"human":"2007-Oct-12","y":2007,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rtr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rtr","width":1280,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5rtq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5rtq","width":1280,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/faxl74aygcdhll9orxfr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"faxl74aygcdhll9orxfr","width":1280,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/afdm9fjoya5voamvvhaz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"afdm9fjoya5voamvvhaz","width":1280,"height":780},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uaalpnh2bn2wms3wbz54.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uaalpnh2bn2wms3wbz54","width":1280,"height":780}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Ed4Aa8Entdk"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1ib2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1ib2","width":800,"height":1120},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Overclocked:_A_History_of_Violence"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/339850\/Overclocked_A_History_of_Violence\/"}],"external":{"steam":"339850"}}
