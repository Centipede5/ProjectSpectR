He picks them up and you have to bring them back to your cage to get points. Each of the 10 levels is filled with sharks wanting to kill you. You can stand a few bites but sooner or later you are dead. By touching the poisonous jelly-fish you even die immediately. You can avoid this by shooting them with your gun. You get a point and they sink stunned to the ground but they are not dead and recover quickly. Simply shooting in their direction will frighten them and they lose your tail for a few moments. In higher levels the amount of sharks increase, they get more aggressive and your gun numbs them for a shorter period.","popularity":1,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"dAB_QTTKw90"}]}
