It's simple to learn, with just a handful of commands to master. But the unique gameplay provides an amazing depth. A detailed overhead view shows monsters, obstacles, and other game elements. You have as much time as you like to contemplate your next move. So this is a good game for relaxing, but also terrifically involving once you get started. You'll be hooked by the story of Beethro and his troublesome nephew, Halph. Our heroes set off on a harmless jaunt, but end up far below the surface, chased by a clownish madman. They begin to uncover a vast, underground bureaucracy, and things only get stranger the further they delve. You've got over 350 rooms ahead--each one a singular challenge for you to conquer.","collection":1195,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[60044,25222,14047,26223,9086,19222,27266,41348,10225,63306],"tags":[268435465,536873787,536875258],"category":0,"keywords":[2875,4346],"genres":[9],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vgnbv8qvzopfrnu1pxgk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vgnbv8qvzopfrnu1pxgk","width":250,"height":250}}
