Players can use weapons such as crowbars, baseball bats, and knives to kill various bikers, gang members, and thugs. Players can trigger close-up, slow motion attacks that often result in bones snapping or enemies getting stunned. Punches and melee attacks frequently cause splashes of red blood to fly through the air, while floors\/walls are sometimes stained with pools of blood. During the course of the game, players must track down a villain who has molested an actress appearing in a pornography film. The search leads players to a strip club that contains go-go dancers in cages, peep-show booths, and a pornographic film playing in the background. Moaning and suggestive dialogue (e.g., 'Ohhh, it's so big!') can be heard echoing from the film. Some strong profanity (e.g., 'f*ck' and 'sh*t') can also be heard in the dialogue. The game features supplemental videos detailing the history of the Watchmen franchise, including scenes from the movie. The character Dr. Manhattan, a blue-skinned superhero, is sometimes depicted without clothes (e.g., exposed buttocks, brief full frontal nudity). Another scene from the movie depicts Dr. Manhattan using telekinesis to blow up a group of Vietnamese soldiers. The soldiers explode in front of the camera, though most of the blood and gore is stylized to appear black and viscous.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.watchmenvideogame.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/21010"}],"external":{"steam":"21010"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
