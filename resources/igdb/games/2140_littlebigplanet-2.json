An inter-dimensional vacuum cleaner called the Negativitron appears over the skies of LittleBigPlanet and begins to suck up its inhabitants, including Sackboy. Larry Da Vinci (Robbie Stevens[9]), the leader of a semi-secret semi-organised group known as \"The Alliance\", comes to Sackboy's rescue, saving him from the Negativitron (Jeremy Mayne[9]). The organisation is dedicated to battling with the Negativitron and defeating it before it destroys Craftworld (Alternate name for game's environment).[7] After Sackboy passes the tests in Larry's Hideout, he tells him that they must get to Victoria Von Bathysphere's (Judy Sweeney[9]) Laboratory, since she has built a Sackbot army for the Alliance.","collection":238,"rating":80.7862486171654,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":93.75,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":87.2681243085827,"total_rating_count":69,"rating_count":61,"games":[24426,20342,55173,56033,28070,33269,19150,9599,29032,19001],"tags":[1,27,33,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871033,536871262,536872030,536872589,536872961,536873712,536873810,536874552,536876797,536878612,536879069,536881080,536893006,536893007,1073741828],"developers":[746],"publishers":[334],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[121,350,1118,1677,2049,2800,2898,3640,5885,7700,8157,10168,22094,22095],"themes":[1,27,33],"genres":[8,9,31],"dlcs":[24239],"first_release_date":1295308800000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1295308800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Jan-18","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1295395200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Jan-19","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1297296000000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Feb-10","y":2011,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1295308800000,"human":"2011-Jan-18","y":2011,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"LBP 2","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f0nf0qwovarl7m9xhocc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f0nf0qwovarl7m9xhocc","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/llxnfvw0kaw3bhhmlf8a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"llxnfvw0kaw3bhhmlf8a","width":562,"height":316},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oact409tlmgncnz2yudc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oact409tlmgncnz2yudc","width":1597,"height":893},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qt9fewoguu2gbqzkbevd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qt9fewoguu2gbqzkbevd","width":1587,"height":895},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qf0uxenw2ftlizr3bqdu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qf0uxenw2ftlizr3bqdu","width":1591,"height":895}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Ky-JUL0SDDs"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qi2hbbjcd6mp3sqcwooo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qi2hbbjcd6mp3sqcwooo","width":435,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a side-scrolling platformer game in which players help a small doll (Sackboy) traverse through whimsical environments.
