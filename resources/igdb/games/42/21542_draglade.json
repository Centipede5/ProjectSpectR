Scientists will discover how to turn atmospheric Matter into energy. Soon thereafter, a means of harnessing this energy \u2013 G-Cons \u2013 will allow for the conversion of this power into a weapon called a \u201cGlade\u201d. When a Glade hits something, the Glade emits a sound. Fighters and entertainers quickly realized the potential of Grapping, as the music generated by the clashing Glades in combat provided an experience that couldn't be matched in any other sport. In this world overcome by Grapping fever, four young indie Grappers \u2013 Hibito, Guy, Kyle, and Daichi \u2013 will strive to reach the ranks of the Major Grappers.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":1,"publishers":[818],"category":0,"first_release_date":1196726400000,"platforms":[20],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1204675200000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Mar-05","y":2008,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1196726400000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Dec-04","y":2007,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1199491200000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Jan-05","y":2008,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kvhc7kbvp3jrv2shzb9c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kvhc7kbvp3jrv2shzb9c","width":256,"height":384}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1i73.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1i73","width":640,"height":575}}
