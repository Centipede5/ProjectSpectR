Some air-based enemies will leave behind powerups for Vanguard to collect, when hit by its anti-aircraft missiles; they can restore its fuel, increase its fuel capacity, make it invulnerable for a short period of time, and even grant it an extra life if it manages to collect enough of them (which is initially thirteen, but it can go up to sixteen).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":554774400000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":554774400000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Aug-01","y":1987,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b3dyxtkxskuvgpmkxhjx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b3dyxtkxskuvgpmkxhjx","width":1204,"height":850}}
