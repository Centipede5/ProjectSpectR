As with Eiyuu Densetsu, it was ported to a number of systems, including to the Sega Mega Drive in 1995 by Sega Falcom exclusively in Japan. \n \nThe Dragon Slayer series would continue with Lord Monarch, which also saw an entry on the Mega Drive. However, with the next The Legend of Heroes game, Eiyuu Densetsu III: Shiroki Majou, Falcom decided to break the series away from Dragon Slayer.
