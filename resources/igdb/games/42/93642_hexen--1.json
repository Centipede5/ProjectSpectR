The enemies still have all but their front sprites missing, but they retain their gory deaths when killed by a strong hit or weapon. \n \nThis version also has hidden two-player link-up cooperative and deathmatch modes, accessible only through the unlockable cheat menu. While this port shares the FMV scenes and most of the Redbook audio music from the other CD-ROM versions, it also includes some new music tracks.","popularity":1,"version_parent":3512,"version_title":"Sega Satrun port","category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yxsqcdofhdkzein0jx8b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yxsqcdofhdkzein0jx8b","width":1029,"height":1593}}
