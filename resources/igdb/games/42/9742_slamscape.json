Derived from your subconscious, the regions contain four heavily guarded Orb-Ids needed for level progression. Once obtained, you'll then take the orbs to a central location within that level. You must employ a different strategy for each orb you wish to obtain.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,36950,64204,27314,71455,25300,142,11253,10039],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871882,536872431,536875194,536876694,1073741826],"developers":[1045],"publishers":[1261],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[970,1519,4282,5782],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":851990400000,"platforms":[6,7],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":7,"date":851990400000,"region":8,"human":"1996","y":1996,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":851990400000,"region":8,"human":"1996","y":1996,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hssjbgkreojhvp8li09x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hssjbgkreojhvp8li09x","width":628,"height":640}}
