{"id":11142,"name":"Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom","slug":"buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/buck-rogers-planet-of-zoom","created_at":1434399443015,"updated_at":1517270818585,"summary":"Sega released the arcade video game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom in 1982. It was a forward-scrolling rail shooter where the user controls a spaceship in a behind-the-back third-person perspective that must destroy enemy ships and avoid obstacles; the game was notable for its fast pseudo-3D scaling and detailed sprites. The game would later go on to influence the 1985 Sega hit Space Harrier, which in turn influenced the 1993 Nintendo hit Star Fox. \nBuck is never seen in the game, except assumedly in the illustration on the side of the arcade cabinet, and its only real connections to Buck Rogers are the use of the name and the outer space setting. Home versions were released for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari XE, ColecoVision, Coleco Adam, Intellivision, MSX and Sega SG-1000 video game systems, and the Commodore VIC-20, Commodore 64, Texas Instruments TI-99\/4A, Apple II and ZX Spectrum computers. A version for IBM PC using CGA graphics was also available.","collection":3500,"franchise":71,"franchises":[71],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,36950,27314,25300,28029,64204,142,11253,11156,71455],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536870918,536871078,536871501,536871784,536871859,536871882,536871937,536871969,536872019,536872152,536872390,536873064,536873186,536875054,536875081,536875222,536875291,536875437,536875837,536875879,536876005,536876634,536877142,536886223,1073741826],"developers":[11739],"publishers":[11739],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[6,166,589,872,947,970,1025,1057,1107,1240,1478,2152,2274,4142,4169,4310,4379,4525,4925,4967,5093,5722,6230,15311],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[71,68,52,84,66,59,65,75,15,26,129],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":66,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":68,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":84,"date":504835200000,"region":5,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":129,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":71,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oyzzuug0tpvhcoc26mqa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oyzzuug0tpvhcoc26mqa","width":280,"height":192},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/igsyypuvwhwozlklu831.jpg","cloudinary_id":"igsyypuvwhwozlklu831","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mhtoowib5019kwmfjr5h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mhtoowib5019kwmfjr5h","width":256,"height":192}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bjb17zewk3uqtmhfysur.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bjb17zewk3uqtmhfysur","width":600,"height":832}}
