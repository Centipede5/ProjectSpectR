The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible. \n \nShounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.","popularity":1,"games":[55752,12632,27209,45717,31559,70861,56987,63138,49074,42419],"tags":[268435464,536870990,536871208,536872961,536875053,536875222],"category":0,"keywords":[78,296,2049,4141,4310],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":727660800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":727660800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Jan-22","y":1993,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zbgcjadywrbcu2cirage.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zbgcjadywrbcu2cirage","width":220,"height":400}}
