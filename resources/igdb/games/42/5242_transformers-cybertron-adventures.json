Players must defeat a group of enemies in one area from a cover point. After all enemies are defeated, the character will move along a pre-defined path to another area, and so on. Occasionally during gameplay the character will transform into vehicle, and the player must control them to reach one point, destroying obstacles on the way. Offline co-op is also featured. The game delivers only 6 levels and a couple challenges.","franchise":7,"franchises":[7],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":23,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":23,"total_rating_count":3,"games":[103298,103281,95340,41595,103301,32902,83808,19164,78770,28029],"tags":[268435461,1073741826],"developers":[1054],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,3],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1277164800000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1277164800000,"human":"2010-Jun-22","y":2010,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hp8i1jlozjy2y4ioukcg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hp8i1jlozjy2y4ioukcg","width":480,"height":270}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lobemgjxd0xtv9vutemd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lobemgjxd0xtv9vutemd","width":256,"height":359},"esrb":{"rating":5},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":5,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
