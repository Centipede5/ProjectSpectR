There are six multiplayer modes and aspects of each mode \u2014 such as the weapons and levels available, the winning condition, and managing characters.  \n The game contains a level editor that allows the player to create their own level from a selection of various pre-made tiles. Light settings of the tiles can be edited individually and items can be added to the map.","storyline":"Taking place at nine fictional locations between 1935 and 2035, the story follows 18 characters' individual attempts at defeating their own foes and the \"TimeSplitters\" with whom they have sided. In each level, the player can choose from one of two characters specific to each mission, and must kill enemies as they move through the level to retrieve an object and then carry that object to the exit portal. After a player picks up the object, TimeSplitters, evil mutant creatures, spawn endlessly throughout the level and attack the player.","collection":436,"rating":78.9013534194246,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"total_rating":78.9013534194246,"total_rating_count":12,"rating_count":12,"games":[2143,1638,241,2144,495,26401,517,7587,2413,2031],"tags":[17,18,19,22,39,268435461,536871041,536871082,536871083,536871113,536871213,536871277,536871365,536871470,536871487,536871610,536872032,536872211,536872234,536872375,536872666,536872862,536873122,536874182,536874810,536874834,536874900,536874947,536875067,536875079,536875082,536875122,536875127,536875158,536875242,536875271,536875303,536875305,536875330,536875358,536875435,536875483,536875484,536875523,536875572,536875624,536875642,536875688,536875789,536875797,536875803,536875804,536875814,536875819,536875822,536875896,536875901,536875902,536876028,536876062,536876068,536876216,536876221,536876223,536876262,536876391,536876415,536876466,536876564,536876613,536876687,536876723,536876850,536876964,536876973,536877029,536877264,536877331,536877537,536877628,536877630,536877713,536877801,536877880,536877933,536877938,536878007,536878070,536878228,536878269,536878505,536879042,536879938,536880353,536880441,536880639,536880816,536881372,536881507,536881511,536881514,536881533,536882324,536883293,536883404,536884863,536885633,1073741825],"developers":[1008],"publishers":[4],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,3,4],"keywords":[129,170,171,201,301,365,453,558,575,698,1120,1299,1322,1463,1754,1950,2210,3270,3898,3922,3988,4035,4155,4167,4170,4210,4215,4246,4330,4359,4391,4393,4418,4446,4523,4571,4572,4611,4660,4712,4730,4776,4877,4885,4891,4892,4902,4907,4910,4984,4989,4990,5116,5150,5156,5304,5309,5311,5350,5479,5503,5554,5652,5701,5775,5811,5938,6052,6061,6117,6352,6419,6625,6716,6718,6801,6889,6968,7021,7026,7095,7158,7316,7357,7593,8130,9026,9441,9529,9727,9904,10460,10595,10599,10602,10621,11412,12381,12492,13951,14721],"themes":[17,18,19,22,39],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":972518400000,"pulse_count":13,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":972518400000,"human":"2000-Oct-26","y":2000,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"TS"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rjrt77fcizatuoermhti.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rjrt77fcizatuoermhti","width":640,"height":448}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iue3tkpncbeiacqinm2f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iue3tkpncbeiacqinm2f","width":352,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/timesplitters.wikia.com\/wiki\/TimeSplitters_Wiki"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":8,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
