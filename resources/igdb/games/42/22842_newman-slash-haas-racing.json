Those looking for an authentic Indy Car experience are in luck, as this is a game of remarkable depth and customizability. It offers a mind-boggling array of options - digital or analog control, single- or dual-player racing, four levels of difficulty, eleven tracks, 16 drivers, and a partridge in the pit stop. OK, I'm kidding about the last item, but it's obvious that Psygnosis doesn't think Indy Car racing is a laughing matter, and it's gone to great lengths to make Newman\/Haas as realistic as possible.","popularity":1,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"keywords":[1166,3425,4157,4205,6764],"genres":[10,14],"first_release_date":897091200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":897091200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Jun-06","y":1998,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/okbsztpcfy87ijw3mjqm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"okbsztpcfy87ijw3mjqm","width":1024,"height":768}],"esrb":{"rating":3}}
