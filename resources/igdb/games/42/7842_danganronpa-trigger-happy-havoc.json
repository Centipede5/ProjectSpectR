As he explores the abandoned, dirty halls, it becomes clear that something is very wrong. He and his new classmates make their way to the gymnasium, where a demented robotic bear, calling himself Monokuma and claiming to be the school's headmaster, makes a declaration: \"You're all going to be living here from now on. If you want to go free, your only choice...is murder.\" \n\nAnd so...fifteen high school students gathered from across the country have been imprisoned. Their strength, their commitment, their very humanity will be tested time and time again. Why must they clash in these class trials? Who's the mastermind behind it all? And what is this shadowy figure really after? The battle against the looming, invisible enemy known only as despair is about to begin...","collection":1301,"rating":89.96513439726981,"popularity":8,"aggregated_rating":82.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":86.14923386530155,"total_rating_count":69,"rating_count":58,"games":[9694,15830,14176,12881,56033,19561,17906,8968,7364,7194],"tags":[1,19,43,268435461,268435487,536870990,536871006,536871041,536871052,536871109,536871127,536871133,536871937,536871939,536872032,536872070,536872211,536872350,536872581,536872691,536874916,536875046,536875049,536875050,536875062,536875281,536875422,536875453,536875472,536875526,536875590,536875695,536876240,536876356,536876476,536876589,536876661,536876703,536876875,536876894,536877288,536877304,536877381,536877383,536877960,536878097,536878299,536878312,536878366,536878546,536879047,536879812,536880240,536881267,536883252,536883253,536883254,536890955,536890956,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[1217],"publishers":[2262,1217],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":91740,"completely":151200},"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,94,129,140,197,215,221,1025,1027,1120,1158,1299,1438,1669,1779,4004,4134,4137,4138,4150,4369,4510,4541,4560,4614,4678,4783,5328,5444,5564,5677,5749,5791,5963,5982,6376,6392,6469,6471,7048,7185,7387,7400,7454,7634,8135,8900,9328,10355,12340,12341,12342,20043,20044],"themes":[1,19,43],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":1290643200000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[34,6,39,14,46,38,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1392336000000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Feb-14","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1392076800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Feb-11","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1290643200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Nov-25","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1290643200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Nov-25","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1290643200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Nov-25","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1381363200000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Oct-10","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1392508800000,"region":3,"human":"2014-Feb-16","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1458259200000,"human":"2016-Mar-18","y":2016,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1458259200000,"human":"2016-Mar-18","y":2016,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1458259200000,"human":"2016-Mar-18","y":2016,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Danganronpa","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Danganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Dangan Ronpa","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Dangan Ronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30c0\u30f3\u30ac\u30f3\u30ed\u30f3\u30d1 \u5e0c\u671b\u306e\u5b66\u5712\u3068\u7d76\u671b\u306e\u9ad8\u6821\u751f","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Danganronpa: Kib\u014d no Gakuen to Zetsub\u014d no K\u014dk\u014dsei","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qwfaxg8sfvafj3hayfhw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qwfaxg8sfvafj3hayfhw","width":960,"height":544},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mzp6kb3jvci80tfnz4ku.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mzp6kb3jvci80tfnz4ku","width":960,"height":544},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g3zmazlcrgpwjmun467h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g3zmazlcrgpwjmun467h","width":960,"height":544},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/grpzwy1objghd6roscpc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"grpzwy1objghd6roscpc","width":960,"height":544},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ujabqe2ari609b061g8d.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ujabqe2ari609b061g8d","width":960,"height":544}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"9vI_sxaRqyE"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"TLWM6m37lfU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zl0z6bnsiczducn94q2f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zl0z6bnsiczducn94q2f","width":220,"height":283},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a puzzle-adventure game in which players follow high-school students attempting to escape from a robot-bear captor. As players navigate the school, they sometimes come upon various corpses. Players investigate the various crime scenes, looking for clues and interviewing rival classmates.

There are also depictions of characters getting impaled by spikes and knives. Blood is frequently depicted on and around dead bodies. During the course of the game, the dialogue contains suggestive material (e.g., \u201cLike I'd w-want to go anywhere with a dirty slut like you,\u201d \u201cIt's not some pervy 'adult' video or anything\u201d and \u201cHe...abused me...And he...he took pictures\u201d).
