Its gameplay was similar to SNK's earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat 'em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack & slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.[1] \n \nThe game allowed cooperative gameplay with up to two players on the same screen.[1] As only the player characters' silhouettes are visible on screen as wire-frame models, much like Punch-Out!!,[2] the game's perspective may be considered either first-person[1] or third-person.[3] The game was later cited as an inspiration for the 2010 first-person fighting game Rage of the Gladiator.[4] A sequel of the game entitled Crossed Swords 2 was released in Japan on May 2, 1995 for the Neo-Geo CD, and was one of the few games designed specifically for the Neo-Geo CD, rather than being an arcade port.[5]","collection":3740,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[2933,80916,54775,68441,8436,47823,103020,28309,55092,27373],"tags":[1,268435468,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871301,536871581,536871969,536872883,536873066,536874706,536874743,536875042,536875106,536875200,536875308,536875390,536875658,536875668,536875699,536875703,536875712,536875792,536875814,536875830,536875944,536876007,536876413,536876414,536876471,536876648,536876700,536876730,536876731,536876880,536877451,536877559,536878097,536878598,536880264,536881428],"publishers":[17183],"category":0,"keywords":[226,227,296,389,669,1057,1971,2154,3794,3831,4130,4194,4288,4396,4478,4746,4756,4787,4791,4800,4880,4902,4918,5032,5095,5501,5502,5559,5736,5788,5818,5819,5968,6539,6647,7185,7686,9352,10516],"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":664761600000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[80,136,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":783561600000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Oct-31","y":1994,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":664761600000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Jan-25","y":1991,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":686275200000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Oct-01","y":1991,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":783561600000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Oct-31","y":1994,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":664761600000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Jan-25","y":1991,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":678326400000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Jul-01","y":1991,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/erpiwtvjpjf9akqrhisd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"erpiwtvjpjf9akqrhisd","width":600,"height":520}}
