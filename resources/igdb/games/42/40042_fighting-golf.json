Lee Trevino is playable as a character named Super Mex (an actual nickname of his); other characters include Pretty Amy, Miracle Chosuke and Big Jumbo. Pretty Amy has limited range, but the easiest control (\"control\" refers to the length of the aiming guide). Miracle Chosuke and Super Mex have average attributes. Big Jumbo has the best range, but the worst control. Despite the title, no fighting is involved in the game, the title is Asian \"Engrish.\" The player has to avoid sand traps, water hazards, rough ground and trees. \n \nThe courses range from relatively straightforward fairways to elaborate arrangements of sand traps. The two courses available for play are the United States, which consists of mostly bunkers and super rough and the Japan course, consisting of water and tight boundaries. \n \nAt the end of the game, the player is greeted with a photorealistic shot of the country club lodge against the setting sun and surrounded by trees.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14]}
