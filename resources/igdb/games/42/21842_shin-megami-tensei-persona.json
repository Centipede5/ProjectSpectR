It is a departure from the typical swords and sorcery, and it delivers a tale of dreams, the purpose of life, and who we are as individuals. In Persona you have modern weapons like an Uzi and an AK-47. And instead of always fighting monsters, you are given the opportunity to talk your way through a confrontation. By talking things out, you can earn components of spells the more components you have, the more powerful your spells become.","collection":552,"franchise":552,"franchises":[552,592],"rating":80.57635626579551,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":90,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":85.28817813289776,"total_rating_count":7,"rating_count":5,"version_parent":11452,"version_title":"Shin Megami Tensei: Persona","games":[49414,25636,35737,51213,103337,89828,103303,75851,104236,16587],"tags":[268435468],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1256169600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1256169600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Oct-22","y":2009,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iz4ktd7r8geeaatew9ym.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iz4ktd7r8geeaatew9ym","width":480,"height":272},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zij3ovkn7qbcpgpz46px.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zij3ovkn7qbcpgpz46px","width":480,"height":272},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/whsqqvkuazcxoilaopko.jpg","cloudinary_id":"whsqqvkuazcxoilaopko","width":478,"height":272}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oy5adfgxqeugznj7iiry.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oy5adfgxqeugznj7iiry","width":640,"height":922}}
