The game also offers three different play modes; Time Trial (raced over a single course), World Championship (raced over all four courses) and Time Trial (also raced over all four courses). \n \nEach car has a basic high and low gear. Also, as the player races the course, a 'Turbo' meter builds up. The Turbo will occasionally kick in and give the player's car a temporary speed boost. Rival cars are also able to turbo-boost.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46843,14363,70773,12719,26709,67442,39290,40470,19539,58785],"tags":[268435466,536871501,536871969,536872695,536873390,536874337,536874824,536875069,536875075,536875117,536875437,536876214,536876749,536876816,536878434,536878436],"category":0,"keywords":[589,1057,1783,2478,3425,3912,4157,4163,4205,4525,5302,5837,5904,7522,7524],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":791596800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":791596800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Feb-01","y":1995,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rpumqvhamorekjrokibv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rpumqvhamorekjrokibv","width":1440,"height":1008}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nhczy4lkmg3th7by8kne.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nhczy4lkmg3th7by8kne","width":1440,"height":775}}
