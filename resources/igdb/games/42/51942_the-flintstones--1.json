The game features many original Flintstones characters, such as Fred, Wilma, Barney, and others. Instead of the usual \"save the princess\" or \"liberate the world\" kinds of a plot, \"The Flintstones\" is mainly based on small quests: Fred has to retrieve a lost item, etc. The large levels are divided into smaller stages. In the end of each level there is a boss battle. The gameplay involves mostly jumping and hitting the enemies on the heads with a club. The health is measured by hearts. During the game Fred will find many useful items, including some that will increase his health level.","franchise":503,"franchises":[503],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[94873,1070,106849,5411,1073,47211,38610,31579,106530,51247],"tags":[268435464,1073741828],"developers":[13165],"publishers":[9723,1440],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":730339200000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":757296000000,"region":1,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":753667200000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Nov-19","y":1993,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":730339200000,"region":2,"human":"1993-Feb-22","y":1993,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iykpbfhqy5zo0riwmdxb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iykpbfhqy5zo0riwmdxb","width":743,"height":1024},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sega"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Flintstones_(1993_video_game)"}]}
