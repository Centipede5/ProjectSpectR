The objective of the game is to progress through each level, defeating enemies and huge bosses. Vehicle and player health slowly regenerate, while vehicles can be instantly repaired with a special pick-up item. Once your vehicle is destroyed, you run around on foot. You're limited to a weak machine gun, but get double points for destroyed enemies. Once you lose all your health, you lose a life. After about 10 seconds of being on foot, your vehicle respawns.","collection":2376,"hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":70,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":70,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[55038,36950,68287,7333,35282,7350,17130,109627,90099,28029],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536870937,536871783,536871882,536872205,536872535,536872695,536873810,536874182,536874398,536874539,536874745,536874947,536875046,536875195,536875309,536875484,536875610,536876120,536876362,536876412,536876435,536876687,536876990,536877207,536877834,536880294,536882089,536882729,536888127,536893108,536893109,1073741827],"developers":[5318],"publishers":[80,129,5319],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[25,871,970,1293,1623,1783,2898,3270,3486,3627,3833,4035,4134,4283,4397,4572,4698,5208,5450,5500,5523,5775,6078,6295,6922,9382,11177,11817,17215,22196,22197],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":1165968000000,"platforms":[6,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1193097600000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Oct-23","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1165968000000,"region":8,"human":"2006-Dec-13","y":2006,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1264636800000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Jan-28","y":2010,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rinpqjvc7acsvoi6dpfy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rinpqjvc7acsvoi6dpfy","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o7tyhsun83kyr0yupqto.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o7tyhsun83kyr0yupqto","width":219,"height":261},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Assault_Heroes"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
