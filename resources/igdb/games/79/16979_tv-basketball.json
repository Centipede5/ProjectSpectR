It was the first basketball video game, the first video game to use sprites, and the first to represent human characters. \n \nThe gameplay was ported by General Instrument onto their AY-8610 chip to be used for home consoles. But unlike in the original game, here each player controls just one paddle, which can move all over the screen. The GI-version also features a one-player practice mode.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[1333,2933,30830,17548,103218,55077,44242,15851,37419,35371],"tags":[1,268435469,268435470,536870970,536871049,536872060,536872078,536872211,536872673,536875073,536875075,536875081,536875125,536875265,536875610,536875611,536875666,536875750,536875798,536875837,536876714,536879153,536880489,536882669,536882670,536882671,1073741828],"developers":[1440],"publishers":[1440,566],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"keywords":[58,137,1148,1166,1299,1761,4161,4163,4169,4213,4353,4698,4699,4754,4838,4886,4925,5802,8241,9577,11757,11758,11759],"themes":[1],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":139276800000,"platforms":[52,141],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":139276800000,"human":"1974-Jun-01","y":1974,"m":6},{"category":2,"platform":141,"date":252374400000,"human":"1977","y":1977,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"TV Basketball","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jpn59st68nmh1qqqhohi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jpn59st68nmh1qqqhohi","width":600,"height":432},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vnqpei80chldn4jzj9lp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vnqpei80chldn4jzj9lp","width":480,"height":360}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"BMV_meVa7m8"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cdzavpwdr4yuelkeifsg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cdzavpwdr4yuelkeifsg","width":850,"height":1096}}
