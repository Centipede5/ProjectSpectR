Suddenly, a fish hits your lure. The fish pulls the line while you fight it, trying to reel it in. It dives deep and flies out of the water; you give the line some slack, and then reel it in. Eventually, the fish loses this fight. You can have this kind of excitement with ZEBCO FISHING! for the Game Boy Color. Hit one of two lakes with a choice of 11 different fishing lures. Try to catch the biggest bass possible in the Tournament mode, and for an extra challenge, try to catch exactly 21 pounds of bass in the Blackjack Bass mode. In both modes, catching fish other than bass has no effect on the outcome. Try to become a fishing champion with ZEBCO FISHING!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[50597,49650,47336,5121,49302,44944,38167,37773,25203,4706],"tags":[268435470,536871421,536872928,536875232,536875233,536876274],"category":0,"keywords":[509,2016,4320,4321,5362],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":938736000000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":938736000000,"region":8,"human":"1999-Oct-01","y":1999,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jy31wzzayihark07ihqo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jy31wzzayihark07ihqo","width":535,"height":532}}
