The player must use the four-way joystick, to direct the eponymous \"Macho Mouse\" around a maze, leaving a trail of dots behind him as he goes (like Pac-Man in reverse), and causing images of his head to appear while avoiding cats that will kill him on contact - but as in Konami's Amidar, Macho Mouse can jump by means of a button and stun the cats for a short period of time. Between rounds, there is a \"slot machine\" similar to that of Chuo Co., Ltd.'s Funny Mouse (later re-released by Taito Corporation, as \"Super Mouse\").","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0}
