Each island contains multiple paths, and the creatures have to swim the water between the islands, which is slower than running. Many obstacles slow the creatures down, including apple-throwing trees, lightning, sea monsters, giant clams, and sinkholes. There are also ways to move forward quickly, such as a hand that throws a character and caves that warp the creature to the exit. In addition to a joystick for movement, there is a jump button. \n \nThe goal is to finish in the top three to progress to the next race.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/il6sl7ydihn8uxd9cujp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"il6sl7ydihn8uxd9cujp","width":850,"height":1103}}
