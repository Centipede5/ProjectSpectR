By playing Creatures, you will be taking part in one of the largest Artificial Life experiments ever. Raise and train a troupe of cuddly virtual life creatures that live on the Capillata space ship and help them reach the level of advancement sufficient to fly it. This task is not easy, Norns are eager to learn but because they own individual personalities they may not always do what you want them to (or even what you expect!). Like a good parent you must be patient, teach them new things using many tools available and raise them the best you can so that after some time you could be proud of how much they have managed to achieve.","collection":1526,"popularity":1,"games":[54996,29173,19301,55590,9789,34823,35371,22425,25311,13200],"tags":[18,34,268435469,268435471,268435487,536871208,536871446,536871872,536871882,536871906,536871939,536872060,536874694,536875531,536878326,536882216],"category":0,"keywords":[296,534,960,970,994,1027,1148,3782,4619,7414,11304],"themes":[18,34],"genres":[13,15,31],"first_release_date":1094774400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1094774400000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Sep-10","y":2004,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bedkwexv2b5co24asldk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bedkwexv2b5co24asldk","width":250,"height":354}}
