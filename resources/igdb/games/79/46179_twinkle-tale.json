These lights desired domination, and so tried to destroy each other, creating a new darkness and a white light in the process. The white light, desiring peace, locked the other lights and the new darkness in crystals, encased itself in a diamond, and created Alpherion. \n \nApprentice magician Saria is summoned by her teacher to consult a fortuneteller. The fortuneteller alerts Saria to dark wizard Gadou's incoming forces by capturing the great wizards of Alpherion. The fortuneteller gives Saria items so she can go and defeat Gadou.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,28029,68324,76246,19341,10039,32902,68142,27523,28751],"tags":[1,268435461,536871208,536871937,536878611],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1025,7699],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":714614400000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":714614400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Aug-24","y":1992,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o728xn77h0dyujarelk1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o728xn77h0dyujarelk1","width":800,"height":620}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gnez34teoaph8mu0xuam.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gnez34teoaph8mu0xuam","width":1525,"height":2100}}
