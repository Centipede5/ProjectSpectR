The gameplay is similar to Taito's Bubble Bobble. \nPuff and Blow each have a Methane Gas Gun which fires a cloud of immobilising gas. If this comes into contact with a bad guy he will be absorbed into the gas and then float around the screen for a limited time. Bad guys are harmless in this state. Puff and Blow must suck the floating gas clouds into their guns and blast them out against a vertical surface. Bad guys then turn into bonuses which can be collected.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"themes":[1],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nid6rsffyl4bfjh9goaq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nid6rsffyl4bfjh9goaq","width":721,"height":714}}
