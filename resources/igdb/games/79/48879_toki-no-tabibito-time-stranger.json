The player simply visits important people throughout Japanese history as a time-travelling cop, answering their questions and incrementally moving forwards through time towards the present. Most of the game is depicted in a first-person mode where the other person sits across from the main character, who then asks and answers questions. There are a few third-person sequences where the player must get back inside their spaceship-like time machine before it leaves. \n \nWhile there are a few branching paths depending on dialogue choices taken, the game's narrative is fairly linear.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55803,37088,29730,19289,13189,36792,22482,25222,22425,26163],"tags":[17,22,268435487,536870990,536871082,536871939,536873308,536875067,536875172],"category":0,"keywords":[78,170,1027,2396,4155,4260],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":538617600000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":538617600000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Jan-26","y":1987,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jdmfbo5q5olllsmzzwgh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jdmfbo5q5olllsmzzwgh","width":250,"height":373}}
