In short, it is a family space adventure, about a girl's quest to find her identity. Inspired by old classics of the genre, the game blends comedy and drama to form a story that challenges your brain and teases your heart.","storyline":"The story takes place in the Trappist-1 planetary system, approximately 39 light years away from Earth. Below the frozen surface of planet Eedor, a group of children have spent their entire lives in the safe confines of a technologically advanced cave, raised by artificially intelligent robots. Without knowledge of their origins and only a voice recording to guide them, the kids devote their lives to the maintenance of their underground society and the preparation for the \u201cPilgrimage\u201d, a recurring journey through the frozen wastes of Eedor, to the top of a hollow mountain. There they wait, under the dancing colors of the auroras, for a message that never comes. \n \nThe game will take us through the strange community of the children and out into the wild landscape of Eedor. We will follow the story of Aurora and her pet Neemo, as they unwillingly unravel the secrets of the Cave, its absent Architect and the enigmatic, yet silent \u201cVoices\u201d.","collection":4207,"franchise":1140,"franchises":[1140],"hypes":1,"popularity":12.33333333333333,"games":[26163,17469,36792,25311,236,27725,29525,37088,47823,26766],"tags":[17,18,43,268435487,536872110,536881805,1073741826],"developers":[13741],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1198,10893],"themes":[17,18,43],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1538352000000,"status":2,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":7,"platform":6,"human":"TBD"},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1538352000000,"region":8,"human":"2018-Oct-01","y":2018,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p4whdlekrfnhzcwkccab.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p4whdlekrfnhzcwkccab","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gqau2pkrivav7wyxk86g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gqau2pkrivav7wyxk86g","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cca2s8a1fuwo5vyigx0z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cca2s8a1fuwo5vyigx0z","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wejmwnd8vlmwx6u0pkny.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wejmwnd8vlmwx6u0pkny","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hhqxqr3yzypxdmr34xf2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hhqxqr3yzypxdmr34xf2","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lx62vfxo9zsqmpnueclt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lx62vfxo9zsqmpnueclt","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qs51e7wzttytoguwbsxv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qs51e7wzttytoguwbsxv","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"zhu4k-chFrA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lxgvmppzlkkbsrkjr0kg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lxgvmppzlkkbsrkjr0kg","width":2480,"height":3508},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCdHlNuQWPvfECh23_OKtn3g"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/@AuroraTLMGame"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/facebook.com\/AuroraTLMGame"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.noemagames.com"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}
