Welcome to The Labyrinths of Crete, where the blades are sharp and the average life span of a combatant is less than ten minutes. \n \nIn Minotaur, two or more players on different computers are thrown into a huge, randomly generated maze and through the use of various magical and mundane items attempt to find and kill each other. There are over eighty different objects, spells and armaments which any player can pick up and use against his opponents. Loose alliances form and are quickly broken\u2014 in the end, only one of the warriors who entered the maze will leave alive! \n \nThe best way to understand Minotaur is to read this documentation carefully and then play the game several times with the quick-reference nearby. You should attempt to learn the effects of all of the objects and spells so that you can use them quickly and to your advantage. \n \nSpeed is critical in Minotaur: recognizing what magic your opponent is using and swiftly moving to counter it is paramount. Keep moving at all times, as he who hesitates is certainly lost. Be ready for your opponents to materialize around you when it is least expected, and hope they are not as watchful. Good luck, and good hunting!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[12632,19698,36534,18398,37088,47823,26766,16468,26769,23241],"tags":[17,22,268435468,536871063,536871208,536871938,536874778,1073741827],"developers":[620],"publishers":[620],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[151,296,1026,3866],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[14],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":725760000000,"region":8,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y7nz7zbxxwfbswneiwaz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y7nz7zbxxwfbswneiwaz","width":514,"height":344}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ht99g7bbb2ykyz0aizcw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ht99g7bbb2ykyz0aizcw","width":200,"height":303},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/bungie"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Minotaur:_The_Labyrinths_of_Crete"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/bungie.wikia.com\/wiki\/Minotaur"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.bungie.net\/en\/AboutUs#page=games&game=10127"}]}
