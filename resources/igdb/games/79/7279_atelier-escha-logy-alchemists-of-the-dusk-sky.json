As players explore various landscapes, they can encounter and control additional characters to help battle fantastical creatures (e.g., giant bugs, rock creatures, beasts). Players can select weapon attacks (e.g., swords, hammers, giant needles) and magic spells from a menu screen and watch characters employ the attacks in turn-based combat. Enemies usually blink and disappear when defeated. During the course of the game, a sequence depicts drunken characters with flushed faces and slurred speech (e.g., \u201cMarion, that's enough toasting isn't it? I think you've had enough to drink\u201d and \u201cYou turn vulgar when you're drunk.\u201d). The game includes a brief instance of suggestive\/crude dialogue (e.g., \u201cNow that's a low blow. . . just cus' yers are huge! You want me to grope ya?\u201d). The words \u201chell\u201d and \u201cdamn\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language - Violence causing minor injury only","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atelier_Escha_%26_Logy:_Alchemists_of_the_Dusk_Sky"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/atelier.wikia.com\/wiki\/Atelier_Escha_%26_Logy:_Alchemists_of_the_Dusk_Sky"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.koeitecmoamerica.com\/escha-logy\/"}]}
