It features the likeness and is endorsed by professional golfer and LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association) champion Ayako Okamoto, and is one of a handful of sports games to be endorsed by a female athlete. The game uses the real-life golf course of Ko Olina Golf Club in Hawaii. Ko Olina hosted the LPGA Hawaiian Open between 1990-95, when this game was developed. \n \nOkamoto Ayako to Match Play Golf is a much more serious simulation-style golf game. The player has to select their direction and golf club (though the game will automatically select suitable defaults) and accurately hit the power meter to get the most out of each shot.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6685,37909,26772,44422,42477,37933,56409,49040,48701,48388],"tags":[268435470,536870942,536875054,536875138,536875139,536875140],"category":0,"keywords":[30,4142,4226,4227,4228],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":790646400000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":790646400000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Jan-21","y":1995,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kbwbqsxbctjdtn1qsab9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kbwbqsxbctjdtn1qsab9","width":294,"height":541}}
