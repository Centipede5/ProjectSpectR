Players use key-shaped swords, magic spells, and attack cards to defeat classic Disney villains (e.g., Jafar, Ursula, Hades) and fantasy creatures (e.g., dragons, magical armor, shadow imps) in melee-style combat. Battles are accompanied by cries of pain and bursts of light; enemies generally disappear amid colorful orbs when defeated. Some sequences allow players to shoot projectiles from a first-person perspective; a handful of cutscenes depict characters dramatically dissolving into mist after being struck by magical swords or blasts of energy. One sequence depicts red bloodstains on coins.","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":3}}
