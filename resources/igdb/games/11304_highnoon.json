The game is single-player and set in the Wild West in 1889.\n\nThe objective of the game is a showdown between the player and Black Bart. The status of the game, actions available and results of each action are written to the system console as textual descriptions. Turns are taken to either move closer, run, or shoot. Both the player and Bart have four shots and the odds of hitting each other increase as the player closes the 100 paces between each.","popularity":2.666666666666667,"games":[34919,36608,18467,16468,23175,59516,25211,28029,40524,55289],"tags":[1,268435486,536870921,536871846,536873308,536875172,1073741829],"game_engines":[257],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[9,934,2396,4260],"themes":[1],"genres":[30],"first_release_date":31449600000,"platforms":[107],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":107,"date":31449600000,"region":2,"human":"1970","y":1970,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jkl8u4rprrjatrkyo0kv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jkl8u4rprrjatrkyo0kv","width":1056,"height":820},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.mybitbox.com\/highnoon\/"}]}
