Players traverse platforms, solves environmental puzzles, and fight several \"cartoony\" creatures (e.g., chubby cats, wild pigs, fish, spiders) along the way. Players can defeat enemy creatures by swallowing them whole, spitting back projectiles at them, or using weapons (e.g., swords, hammers, staffs) to smack them. Kirby can also perform frenetic melee moves, including jabs, kicks, and throws; enemies generally disappear amid colorful light effects, explosions (a flurry of dust and stars), and screen-shaking. During one boss battle, players pilot a starship and shoot projectiles at a winged-creature from a third-person perspective.","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game was rated PEGI 7 for violence that lacks any apparent harm or injury to fantasy or mythical beings and creatures and for non-realistic violence in a child-friendly setting or context.","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kirby_Star_Allies"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/kirby.wikia.com\/wiki\/Kirby_Star_Allies"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/kirby.nintendo.com\/star-allies\/"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":130,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":4,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":4}]}
