Players control up to four squads of soldiers as they hack-and-slash their way through dozens of enemy forces. Characters use swords, poleaxes, arrows, and maces to kill human enemies and fantastical creatures (e.g., dragons, demons, giants). Battles are highlighted by impact sounds and cries of pain; enemies collapse to the ground when killed. The game includes depictions of female characters in revealing outfits (e.g., large amounts of cleavage); one villain is depicted from low angles, with the camera panning or lingering on her cleavage. Characters are occasionally described as \u201cslightly drunk,\u201d or \u201cdrunk,\u201d and some dialogue references drinking (e.g., \u201cI understand that he feigned drunkenness and attempted to embrace her.\u201d). The word \u201ca*s\u201d appears in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence -\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/koei.wikia.com\/wiki\/Bladestorm:_Nightmare"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.koeitecmoamerica.com\/bladestormnightmare\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/350310"}],"external":{"steam":"350310"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":48,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
