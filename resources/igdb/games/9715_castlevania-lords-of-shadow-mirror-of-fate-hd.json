Players use whips, chains, axes, and other bladed weapons to attack a variety of fantastical creatures (e.g., zombies, werewolves, vampires, harpies). Boss battles contain more frenetic action, with interactive sequences that allow players to stab creatures close-up (e.g., cutting off creatures' limbs\/torsos; stabbing monsters in the eye). A handful of cutscenes depict human characters getting stabbed with large stakes. Enemies emit splashes of blood when struck, and some enemies burst into pieces when killed. During the course of the game, an extended sequence depicts a female vampire seducing a character while caressing a woman's thigh. A handful of creatures briefly appear topless in battle, and a male werewolf character appears to have an appendage\/genitalia between its legs.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.konami-castlevania.com\/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-mirror-of-fate\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/282530"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Castlevania:_Lords_of_Shadow_%E2%80%93_Mirror_of_Fate"}],"external":{"steam":"282530"}}
