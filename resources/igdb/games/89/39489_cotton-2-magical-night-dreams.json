Only months later, it received a virtually arcade-perfect console port on the Sega Saturn. Considered the true sequel to the first game in the series, Cotton 2 also marks the introduction of two new primary characters: Appli, a young princess, and her anthropomorphic hat, Needle. Cotton 2 sees a return to traditional horizontal scrolling in the series, but it also stands out among shoot 'em ups in general for its unique gameplay system. With a heavy incorporation of Newtonian physics, Cotton 2 ultimately mixes elements of 2D platformers with traditional shoot 'em up gameplay. The first release of Cotton 2 on the Sega Saturn also included a mini-calendar for 1998.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":854755200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":854755200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Feb-01","y":1997,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/km7qbdj2azscwh8bbdg5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"km7qbdj2azscwh8bbdg5","width":1440,"height":916}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iqjm925htecdzs8uyops.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iqjm925htecdzs8uyops","width":2476,"height":3508}}
