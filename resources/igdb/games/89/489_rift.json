Rift takes place within the fantasy world of Telara. The game was released in March 2011. \n \nTwo competing factions composed of a selection of races and classes battle each other; as well as the enemies who emerge from dynamic rifts.","storyline":"Telara is the focal point of the elemental Planes: Air, Fire, Water, Earth, Life, and Death\u2014and one point where every one of these Planes intersect with each other. Each Plane is governed by a dragon-deity, a personification of that elemental force. Through the actions of the Dragon of Extinction, Regulos, the various dragons have united in an alliance known as the Blood Storm, for the purpose of invading Telara and gaining use of the intersection of all of their realms. In the past, the Blood Storm was defeated by the inhabitants of Telara with the help of the Vigil, the most powerful of the native gods. \n \nRegulos was cast out into the elemental Planes, while its five compatriots were trapped within Telara and chained beneath a ward designed to close Telara off from external threats. However, Regulos had recently gained entry to Telara, destroying the ward and causing rifts to open, feeding the strength of the trapped dragons and allowing their minds to enter in a bid to destroy Telara's defenders. Players take on the role of the Ascended, resurrected superhuman warriors tasked to defeat the forces of Regulos and cleanse Telara of the threat of the Storm forever.","rating":71.7978141509071,"popularity":7.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":83.75,"aggregated_rating_count":7,"total_rating":77.77390707545355,"total_rating_count":28,"rating_count":21,"games":[54775,47823,19698,55092,80916,22387,81249,59427,103282,36198],"tags":[1,17,268435468,536871208,536871812,536872070,536872406,536873297,536875066,536875521,536882020,536882034,536882694,1073741826],"developers":[315],"publishers":[315],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[2,3,5],"keywords":[296,900,1158,1494,2385,4154,4609,11108,11122,11782],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"expansions":[26137,19322,1935],"first_release_date":1298937600000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[6,92],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1382572800000,"human":"2013-Oct-24","y":2013,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1298937600000,"human":"2011-Mar-01","y":2011,"m":3}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Heroes of Telara","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Rift: Planes of Telara","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wewrmz6fttajxl53jlub.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wewrmz6fttajxl53jlub","width":1500,"height":938},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mmb0cxoikklev4pysgln.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mmb0cxoikklev4pysgln","width":1500,"height":938},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fxfj8l9epnfuz6kb7xwo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fxfj8l9epnfuz6kb7xwo","width":1920,"height":1200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jd6bnprxkr99y7fdrklt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jd6bnprxkr99y7fdrklt","width":1500,"height":928},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a6kuk59b7hhxqk2lqgso.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a6kuk59b7hhxqk2lqgso","width":1500,"height":928}],"videos":[{"name":"Cinematic Trailer","video_id":"AfbG0ajhI6U"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ldI3ypm1gHg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jlir44kkjpljijmizxj7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jlir44kkjpljijmizxj7","width":600,"height":839},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4},"external":{"steam":"39120"}}
