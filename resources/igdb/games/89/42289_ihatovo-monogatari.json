Some of the surprises that the player finds includes a movie theater that is always closed, the opportunity to play the role of a temporary school teacher, and having portraits of unique non-player characters that show up while talking to them. \n \nInspired by the stories of Kenji Miyazawa, the story covers nine chapters and surreal environments. The ending involves speaking to Mr. Miyazawa himself and returning to the real world via the Galaxy Express train.","collection":3736,"popularity":1,"games":[26766,36926,36534,18398,13189,25222,41895,22425,55803,19448],"tags":[268435487,536871208,536871938,536871939,536875057,536875181,536879119],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,1027,4145,4269,8207],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":733968000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":733968000000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Apr-05","y":1993,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/htbferpglgixrlztibpf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"htbferpglgixrlztibpf","width":280,"height":384}}
