Originally intended as a retail release, the game was released as a downloadable WiiWare game instead.[1] It was released in Japan on August 26, 2008, in Europe on November 7, 2008,[2] and in North America on December 1, 2008.[3] Outside Japan the game is published by Square Enix.[4] \n \nThe game costs 500 Nintendo Points. However, only one stage (consisting of two levels and a boss battle), dubbed the \"Starter Pack\" is initially available. The game's six additional stages must be purchased separately as three downloadable content packs, also priced at 500 Points each. As a result, the complete game costs a total of 2000 Nintendo Points.","popularity":1,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"publishers":[26],"category":0,"first_release_date":1219708800000,"platforms":[56],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":56,"date":1219708800000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Aug-26","y":2008,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":56,"date":1226016000000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Nov-07","y":2008,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":56,"date":1228089600000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Dec-01","y":2008,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aklri3zrkcxhdstz2tqe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aklri3zrkcxhdstz2tqe","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v7v1yvgx8wgwrygsov02.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v7v1yvgx8wgwrygsov02","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/efnyzvdwkjxhmgcqxvt6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"efnyzvdwkjxhmgcqxvt6","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xsqzjecvcjpsisaajhih.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xsqzjecvcjpsisaajhih","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zqdcpx3rd0ltkuozg8g9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zqdcpx3rd0ltkuozg8g9","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tklrjabfkk5lg2g5egya.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tklrjabfkk5lg2g5egya","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hapmwe5gtahrl8hwqbhc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hapmwe5gtahrl8hwqbhc","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j7bvhj4cred7vn55ifzn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j7bvhj4cred7vn55ifzn","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pgnd3lguuf53knl2otgm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pgnd3lguuf53knl2otgm","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zklagtn4dnit4cik6dm4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zklagtn4dnit4cik6dm4","width":480,"height":360}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sowtjgsvodz4g2iqdicp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sowtjgsvodz4g2iqdicp","width":555,"height":285},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.spaceinvadersge.com\/portals\/square-enix\/products\/sige\/home\/"}]}
