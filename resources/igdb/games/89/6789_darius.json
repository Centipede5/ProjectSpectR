{"id":6789,"name":"Darius","slug":"darius","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/darius","created_at":1400053716801,"updated_at":1542510615889,"summary":"Darius is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot 'em ups, the game's screen is three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet uses an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game's stages (referred to as zones in the game). The ship's arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game's zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.","collection":2083,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"games":[68287,55038,36950,90099,28029,23852,10209,105269,14364,76747],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871882,536872225,536876514,1073741828],"developers":[1440],"publishers":[12755,7253,1440],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[166,970,1313,5602],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":567907200000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[52,63,86,16,15,26,33,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987-Dec-31","y":1987,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":637545600000,"region":5,"human":"1990-Mar-16","y":1990,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":692582400000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Dec-13","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1216080000000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Jul-15","y":2008,"m":7},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":567907200000,"region":5,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Daraiasu","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30c0\u30e9\u30a4\u30a2\u30b9","comment":"Other"},{"name":"The Dark Side","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Darius+"}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"kfvqBjBd-zQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l53sbxjclss0un46xryo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l53sbxjclss0un46xryo","width":1000,"height":1201},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Darius_(video_game)"}]}
