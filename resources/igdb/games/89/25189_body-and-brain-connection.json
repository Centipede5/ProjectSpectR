The game's goal is to reinforce the mental answers by having them be drilled into the player by playing with motion controls. Games are usually short exercises that last only for a few minutes. Some of the games include a math game which requires the player to make hand motions in either a \"greater than\" or \"less than\" sign and a game which makes the user kick a ball into the goal with the right answer for a math question.","rating":75,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":67.5,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":0,"games":[27266,25222,25646,236,27725,26239,51978,26223,19289,37094],"tags":[40,268435465,268435470,268435487,536881809,1073741826],"developers":[6330],"publishers":[11373,11359,6330],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[10897],"themes":[40],"genres":[9,14,31],"first_release_date":1290211200000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1290211200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Nov-20","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1297123200000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Feb-08","y":2011,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1297382400000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Feb-11","y":2011,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Body & Brain Connection","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Karada de Kitaeru Atarashii Nou Tore","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Dr. Kawashima's Body and Brain Exercises","comment":"European title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ctbqt43417lhk3yectm8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctbqt43417lhk3yectm8","width":630,"height":354},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n0banpq3tiyfil6wqpcx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n0banpq3tiyfil6wqpcx","width":1000,"height":562},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gt5i87gxrtqxbddepq2g.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gt5i87gxrtqxbddepq2g","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wibgcgpzavvuwu4gklo0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wibgcgpzavvuwu4gklo0","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"fCUOjRYiYiQ"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c1xc2ld06z9dspep6luy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c1xc2ld06z9dspep6luy","width":350,"height":499},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a brain exercise game designed to improve players' memory, logic, and hand-eye coordination skills.
