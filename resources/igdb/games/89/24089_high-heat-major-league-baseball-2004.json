Boasting eleven different modes of play, HH 2004 takes several steps beyond the product offered last year and genuinely tries rather hard to push feature diversity. All the classics are here: Home Run Derby, Exhibition, All-Star Games, Batting Practice, Player Editing devices, and other such goodies await the gamers who patiently explore its every area. Perfect for two-player matches, Two-on-Two Showdown returns from last year's PS2 version and presents itself as a console-exclusive option (you're not going to find it in the GBA or PC versions at all).","collection":4520,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6435,25310,855,49399,11557,47334,23537,10658,28193,45630],"tags":[268435469,268435470,536870932,536872078,536872352,536875562,536875570,536875749,536876135,536876136,536876137,536876141,536876143,536876144,536876145,536876146,536876147,536876148,536876149,536876151,536876152,536876153,536876154,536876155,536876156,536876157,536876159,536876165,536876190,536878111,536878341,536884207],"developers":[487],"publishers":[487],"category":0,"keywords":[20,1166,1440,4650,4658,4837,5223,5224,5225,5229,5231,5232,5233,5234,5235,5236,5237,5239,5240,5241,5242,5243,5244,5245,5247,5253,5278,7199,7429,13295],"genres":[13,14],"first_release_date":1046736000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1046736000000,"human":"2003-Mar-04","y":2003,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lqqwyg8mwi0kpv2jcpna.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lqqwyg8mwi0kpv2jcpna","width":640,"height":908}}
