Bizarrely Sega of America released this game twice - initially as Sega Saturn Bootleg II (as a \"sequel\" to Bootleg Sampler). The product in its Bootleg II form is far less common, though aside from a changed title screen (on some discs), the two discs are identical. \n \nUnlike Bootleg Sampler, Sega Screams Volume 1 opts for the \"standard\" Saturn demo disc menus often seen in the European Sega Flash series. \n \nSega Screams Volume 1 was followed by Sega Screams Volume 2.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":823132800000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":823132800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-01","y":1996,"m":2}]}
