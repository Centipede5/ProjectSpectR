Based on events depicted in the motion picture, Ice Age tasks players with guiding both Manny the Mammoth and Sid the Sloth through ten levels of platform-oriented action. Starting out, players control Manny who, along with the human baby Roshan, must navigate a myriad of environments while keeping saber-tooth tigers, hedgehogs, and bees at bay. To do so, Manny is capable of hurling large nuts as makeshift projectiles at any on-screen enemies. Wild animals aren't the only obstacle players will encounter, as they'll need to move a sleeping rhinoceros to advance and inhale skunk fumes to float over dangerous chasms.","collection":3551,"franchise":209,"franchises":[209],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":33,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":33,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[3977,1070,10039,23852,29032,22917,90113,1073,28070,72181],"tags":[268435464,536871426,536875054,536875265,536875294,536875590,1073741828],"developers":[1336],"publishers":[104],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[514,4142,4353,4382,4678],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1016409600000,"platforms":[24],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1016409600000,"human":"2002-Mar-18","y":2002,"m":3}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u82gqxwc1mcxieu82gxo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u82gqxwc1mcxieu82gxo","width":250,"height":250},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
