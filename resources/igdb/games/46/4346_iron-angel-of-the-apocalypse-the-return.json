The story picks up shortly after the events of the previous game. After his showdown with the Scientist and the Android, Tetsujin finds himself disembodied. A mysterious corporation known as SCR gives you a new body, but their plans for your are mysterious. \n \nThe format of this game is mostly similar to the first. This is a first person shooter that relies heavily on video cutscenes to tell a story. The graphics engine has been improved greatly, giving this game a much faster pace than it's predecessor. Whereas the original used a combination of live actors and CG, this one uses CG to depict the humans as well.","collection":797,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[103298,103281,28751,32902,27011,103301,28029,64311,103020,95340],"tags":[1,268435461,536871365,1073741825],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"keywords":[453],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":820368000000,"platforms":[50],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":50,"date":820368000000,"human":"1995","y":1995,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hjzj9ca4ernyvpyjueal.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hjzj9ca4ernyvpyjueal","width":808,"height":1516}}
