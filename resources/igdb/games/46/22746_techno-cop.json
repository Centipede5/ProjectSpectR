Armed with a pistol, the player has to kill various thugs, before the timer runs out. While the game has several levels, the background in the game does not change often. \n \nThe other half of the game is a driving sequence, similar to other computer games such as Roadblasters. \n \nTechno Cop was one of the first games made for the Mega Drive\/Genesis from a third party developer and was part of an attempt by Razorsoft to test what sort of content would Sega allow on a game made for one of its systems.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,68287,36950,10209,64204,27314,10039,25311,76229,76246],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435466,536871078,536871572,536871690,536872191,1073741826,1073741828],"developers":[483,10633],"publishers":[3212],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[166,660,778,1279],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,10],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[29,63,13,16,75,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":3,"platform":29,"date":638841600000,"region":2,"human":"1990-Q1","y":1990,"m":3},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":599529600000,"region":1,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lbf5wolek4wnzuadnols.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lbf5wolek4wnzuadnols","width":1197,"height":877},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/utqcblsa7wrm3e6osuwe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"utqcblsa7wrm3e6osuwe","width":1193,"height":885},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z2nitdi9nff8rnxnjjww.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z2nitdi9nff8rnxnjjww","width":1195,"height":857},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x1ex6cipquyfyzox8uvx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x1ex6cipquyfyzox8uvx","width":1195,"height":883},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kmo3b2l6toc3yxubitqd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kmo3b2l6toc3yxubitqd","width":1201,"height":929}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gx6h9v1ajx7f2dcx5rlc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gx6h9v1ajx7f2dcx5rlc","width":800,"height":1089},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Techno_Cop"}]}
