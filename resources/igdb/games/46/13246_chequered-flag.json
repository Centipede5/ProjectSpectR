The player races over a series of twisting courses, trying to reach the finish line before the timer expires. \n \nChequered Flag includes a Pit-stop facility, a feature that had appeared a year earlier in Taito's 'Continental Circus'. Should the player's car sustain too much damage, a pit-stop must be made to implement repairs.
