It was used as a promotional game, distributed at Christmas 1993. The game was on a single floppy disk in a golden wrap featuring a Jack-in-the-box illustration on top. Later CD versions of both Alone in the Dark and Alone in the Dark 2 came packaged with Jack in the Dark. \n \nIt is Halloween, and Grace Saunders is out for tricks or treats, when she enters a small toy store and gets locked in. The Jack-in-the-Box laughs, the toys play and walk by themselves and hold a dark secret. Grace must discover what secret is that and figure out a way to leave this somewhat eccentric toy store, governed by a somewhat psychopathic Jack-in-the-Box.","collection":364,"popularity":1,"games":[13189,11296,21599,26914,25646,54678,11270,55935,9176,17354],"tags":[19,268435486,268435487,536871213,536871506,536871577,536871672,536871846,536871939,536872032,536872222,536872611,536873890,536874706,536875057,536875058,536875095,536875098,536875102,536875130,536875251,536875275,536875330,536875342,536875344,536875416,536875507,536875511,536875637,536876016,536876089,536876184,536876333,536876432,536876493,536876589,536876984,536877687,536880047],"category":0,"keywords":[301,594,665,760,934,1027,1120,1310,1699,2978,3794,4145,4146,4183,4186,4190,4218,4339,4363,4418,4430,4432,4504,4595,4599,4725,5104,5177,5272,5421,5520,5581,5677,6072,6775,9135],"themes":[19],"genres":[30,31],"first_release_date":758592000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":758592000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Jan-15","y":1994,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gkbjlvxy6yntahjy4sxq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gkbjlvxy6yntahjy4sxq","width":200,"height":240}}
