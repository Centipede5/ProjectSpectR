Part one concerns the character's efforts to avenge the deaths of his or her godparents, who were foully murdered by unknown agents. Along the way, you will do battle with evil monsters, brave deadly traps, and collect the money and magical treasures guarded by dangerous foes. As the story unfolds, the character will also learn of his or her mysterious past, and the legacy left by the character's long dead father.","collection":1842,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[16468,13196,5613,19698,49414,28010,36792,23719,25636,22480],"tags":[17,268435468,1073741827],"developers":[10105],"publishers":[4675],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":788832000000,"region":2,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sjunhhncr2gwerjptbcv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sjunhhncr2gwerjptbcv","width":1684,"height":1578}}
