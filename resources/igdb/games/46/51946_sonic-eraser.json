{"id":51946,"name":"Sonic Eraser","slug":"sonic-eraser","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/sonic-eraser","created_at":1500707745616,"updated_at":1542404931210,"summary":"Sonic Eraser is a video game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series that was available to owners of the Sega Meganet, a modem for the Sega Mega Drive in Japan. While it is a title in the Sonic series, other than featuring the titular character, there is not much that this game has in common with others in the franchise. \n \nSince the Meganet modem never achieved worldwide availability, Sonic Eraser became a \"lost\" Sonic game, until February 2004, when the Sonic CulT website got a hold of the ROM through Sega's Japan-only download service. \n \nThe game is a fairly simple puzzle game. In the versus mode, when a player gets a combination of three consecutive lineups of pieces, that player's Sonic attacks the other player's Sonic. The other player momentarily loses control of his pieces. \n \nThe game is on Sega's B-Club download service.","collection":2156,"franchise":814,"franchises":[814],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[20329,8197,55173,56033,60044,25222,54678,8762,26223,18011],"tags":[268435465,536871049,536871878,536873064,536873096,536873440,536873787,536874943,536875046,536875074,536875367,536875379,536877006,536879971],"category":0,"keywords":[137,966,2152,2184,2528,2875,4031,4134,4162,4455,4467,6094,9059],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":694137600000,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ukfhn1thsnjf5kjmu8pk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ukfhn1thsnjf5kjmu8pk","width":1440,"height":2000},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/sonic.wikia.com\/wiki\/Sonic_Eraser"}]}
