It is set in a ruined world destroyed by a war between dragons. People who were chased off the land built a city on the back of a dragon carcass and are forced to deal with conflicts caused by people and attacking goblins alike. That\u2019s the setting; it\u2019s not only fantasy, but it has military elements, as well. Save data is compatible across all three types of hardware, and online servers are shared, meaning cross-platform co-op play is also possible. Additionally, the game\u2019s world might change depending on the player\u2019s actions.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[12632,36534,27209,18398,11169,19698,26766,47823,36926,11567],"tags":[17,268435468,536870981,536871004,536871208,536871244,536871938,536872245,536873297,536877153,536877196,1073741826],"developers":[112],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[69,92,296,332,1026,1333,2385,6241,6284],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1443657600000,"platforms":[34,6,39],"release_dates":[{"category":6,"platform":6,"date":1451520000000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Q4","y":2015,"m":12},{"category":1,"platform":39,"date":1443657600000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Oct","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":1,"platform":34,"date":1443657600000,"region":5,"human":"2015-Oct","y":2015,"m":10}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"ItSo-cIirnw"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"V3JDpMA-6vA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ntofibua75di8lcbvh4e.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ntofibua75di8lcbvh4e","width":1000,"height":563},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/theworldendeclipse.jp\/"}]}
