Using a wide array of weaponry that ranges from rifles to bows to muzzleloaders, you'll search all sorts of scenery in pursuit of your prey. Journeying through the treacherous mountains of Colorado, deep into the expanses of Montana, and through the deserts of New Mexico, you'll have to keep your eyes peeled if you want to get the jump on these wily critters. There are plenty of animals out there, but each has realistic movements and behavior to evade your efforts. The big game creatures at large include deer, bighorn sheep, elk, and bears. Of course, you'll have access to the requisite calls, attractants, and cover scents, but don't expect any of these intelligent beasts to fall right into your traps. You'll have to use your brains, reflexes, instinct, and some basic perseverance to help bag you a trophy kill. In ROCKY MOUNTAIN TROPHY HUNTER, you won't have to worry about strapping a dead animal to your car roof!","collection":4534,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,11253,67834,51334,51112,22690,68279,28029,27523,54662],"tags":[268435461,268435470,536870976,536871937,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[64,1025,1166],"genres":[5,14],"first_release_date":970790400000,"platforms":[22],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":970790400000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Oct-06","y":2000,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rflejmxc07exjlsfx92f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rflejmxc07exjlsfx92f","width":432,"height":507}}
