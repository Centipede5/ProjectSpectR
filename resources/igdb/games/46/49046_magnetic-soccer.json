{"id":49046,"name":"Magnetic Soccer","slug":"magnetic-soccer","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/magnetic-soccer","created_at":1499974633810,"updated_at":1500358473534,"summary":"Each team has eight players (one goalkeeper, two attackers\/defenders, and three midfielders). When the player moves a row, all of them are moved at once unlike on an actual table soccer set. Rows cannot be moved in an upward or a downward position; only from left to right. Stopping the ball and performing powerful shots is only one aspect of the game. Players can also incapacitate one of the opposing players on a well-timed shot. A tied game results in a penalty shootout. \n \nThree different surfaces are available. Players can practice without a computer opponent and a spectator mode allows newcomers to see two computer-controller opponents face off.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[33],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}]}
