The player pilots a ship with the ability to be expanded by attaching 'modules' (such as lasers or boosters) gained from defeated enemies to a command module, represented by a box containing a broken heart. The goal in the game is to keep your ship alive for as long as possible.","collection":2727,"popularity":1,"games":[68287,36950,28029,27314,64204,142,25300,71455,11253,27523],"tags":[1,18,268435461,536871859,536871882,536871908,536871937,536873246,536875185,536875377,536875875,536876028,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[947,970,996,1025,2334,4273,4465,4963,5116],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1262217600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1262217600000,"region":8,"human":"2009","y":2009,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/savlk2hhyglopjcddqzc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"savlk2hhyglopjcddqzc","width":1280,"height":975},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lveftdibok1rlmay53m2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lveftdibok1rlmay53m2","width":1280,"height":975}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qlkptbyzb1rslkvkszvc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qlkptbyzb1rslkvkszvc","width":1280,"height":975},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Captain_Forever"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.captainforever.com\/captainforever.php"}]}
