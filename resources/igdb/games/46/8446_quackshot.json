Characters are mostly based on Disney's cartoon series Duck Tales. \n \nDonald and his three nephews get their hands on a treasure map and set out to hunt the big prize. Donald travels throughout the world, to places like Egypt, India, South Pole, and even Transylvania, while his nephews fly an airplane. \n \nAs a weapon Donald uses plungers that can freeze the enemies or stick to walls which can then be used for climbing. Other wacky weapons are popcorn and bubblegum.","collection":2986,"franchise":501,"franchises":[501],"rating":81.4577344009656,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":81.4577344009656,"total_rating_count":12,"rating_count":12,"games":[2933,8452,20342,8447,9244,3166,3222,3192,26196,6487],"tags":[268435464,536870928,536871213,536871277,536871557,536871971,536872961,536873021,536873096,536874398,536875054,536875073,536875079,536875088,536875094,536875209,536875292,536875499,536875656,536875822,536875921,536876085,536876208,536876490,536876502,536876694,536876713,536877037,536877996,536878147,536878310,536878596,536878599,1073741828],"developers":[112],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[16,301,365,645,1059,2049,2109,2184,3486,4142,4161,4167,4176,4182,4297,4380,4587,4744,4910,5009,5173,5296,5578,5590,5782,5801,6125,7084,7235,7398,7684,7687],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":693100800000,"platforms":[29,32],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":694137600000,"region":1,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":693100800000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Dec-19","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":693187200000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Dec-20","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":908409600000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Oct-15","y":1998,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"I Love Donald Duck: Guruzia Ou no Hihou","comment":"Other"},{"name":"QuackShot Starring Donald Duck"},{"name":"I Love Donald Duck: Guruzia Ou no Hihou ","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sxhqrclziaklz8tkx1xs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sxhqrclziaklz8tkx1xs","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ow5wrixowlackkndgvkr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ow5wrixowlackkndgvkr","width":320,"height":224},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/quawvjeuzoeldwaci12s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"quawvjeuzoeldwaci12s","width":500,"height":362}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eufpl5icc3k9m3xtdecv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eufpl5icc3k9m3xtdecv","width":256,"height":353},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/QuackShot"}]}
