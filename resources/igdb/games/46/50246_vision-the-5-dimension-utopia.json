The setting is an archaeology floating on the sea. You are a new citizen in this city and you've got to work in order to make money for food and the rent of your suite while staying healthy through sleeping and eating enough. The common way to earn money is playing mostly action-oriented mini-games or doing smaller quest (or rather tasks), which also are part of the plot of the game. \n \nThe game is played in an ego perspective but without a real 3d engine. The game is rendered in still frames which give the illusion of movement trough the city.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[9,13,31],"first_release_date":696902400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":696902400000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-01","y":1992,"m":2}]}
