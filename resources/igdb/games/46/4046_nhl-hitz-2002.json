Hockey may have fewer rules than football, but NHL Hitz features hard-hitting action and very simple 3-on-3 gameplay. The game has franchise modes for a created team that you can design along with championship and exhibition modes. You earn attribute points and credits that you can use to unlock items and improve your players along the way. There are several mini-games and extras hidden deep in the game for you to unlock. NHL Hitz is Midway's attempt at making the most action-packed hockey game to ever hit consoles.","collection":657,"franchise":220,"franchises":[220],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[19772,19732,16599,15920,15511,15510,8675,3569,36847,18681],"tags":[268435470,536870956,536871367,1073741826],"developers":[349],"publishers":[327],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[44,455],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1001289600000,"platforms":[11,21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1006041600000,"human":"2001-Nov-18","y":2001,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1005696000000,"human":"2001-Nov-14","y":2001,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1001289600000,"human":"2001-Sep-24","y":2001,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"NHL Hitz 20-02"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tohe8hwialpk7027sqay.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tohe8hwialpk7027sqay","width":256,"height":363},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
