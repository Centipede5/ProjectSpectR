Included in this pack are Rayman: Raving Rabbids, Raving Rabbids 2, and Raving Rabbids TV Party. \n \nAll three games in the collection have a simple plot line of Rayman either imprisoned or escaping the Rabbids, silly looking rabbit creatures. The first game starts off with Rayman being kidnapped while at a picnic and Rabbids have him endure many types of tests that the player must complete in order for him to be set free. The next game features Rayman entering a mall trying to attack the angry Rabbids that have captured him in the previous game. In TV Party, he is running away from the Rabbids and discovers that a bolt of lightning has transferred the Rabbids into a TV set, which is the premise for the mini games.","collection":3676,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,70906,16468,23175,40524,68324,1070,28029,59516],"tags":[1,536871186,536875240],"category":0,"keywords":[274,4328],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1285545600000,"platforms":[5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1285545600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Sep-27","y":2010,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xd6h03h3wyzdc0fg4fuy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xd6h03h3wyzdc0fg4fuy","width":1181,"height":1648}}
