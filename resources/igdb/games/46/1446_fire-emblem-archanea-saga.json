Most of the games dialogue was voice acted and had some original characters along with characters from the Fire Emblem games Mystery of the Emblem, Shadow Dragon, and The Blade of Light. \n \nThe game was later included with the remake of Mystery of the Emblem as an extra mode, without the timers or the voice acting, for the Nintendo DS called Fire Emblem: New Mystery of the Emblem. This was also only released in Japan.","collection":303,"franchise":769,"franchises":[769],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[14394,22387,7615,28182,26841,20331,55092,26553,27092,26940],"tags":[17,268435468,268435471,268435472,268435480,536871139,536871208,536871327,536871938,536872835,536873260,536874694,536875046,536875161,536875299,536875320,536875472,536875525,536875778,536876087,536876232,536876522,536876546,536876992,536877137,536882683,536882686,536885003,536885297,536885298,1073741827],"developers":[765],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[227,296,415,1026,1923,2348,3782,4134,4249,4387,4408,4560,4613,4866,5175,5320,5610,5634,6080,6225,11771,11774,14091,14385,14386],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,15,16,24],"first_release_date":875404800000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":875404800000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Sep-28","y":1997,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki"},{"name":"BS Fire Emblem: Akaneia Senki"},{"name":"\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a8\u30e0\u30d6\u30ec\u30e0 \u30a2\u30ab\u30cd\u30a4\u30a2\u6226\u8a18\u7de8","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zojieosndoeptehowaqm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zojieosndoeptehowaqm","width":1152,"height":720}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p9qdv9hqzumbn0pj9uoe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p9qdv9hqzumbn0pj9uoe","width":512,"height":384},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/fireemblem.wikia.com\/wiki\/Fire_Emblem:_Archanea_Saga"}]}
