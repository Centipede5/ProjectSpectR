In one-player mode there are 10 opponents to take on in sequence. \n \nThe moves on offer include almost everything you'd find in real wrestling (and I don't mean WWE) - piledrivers, arm twists, body slams and turnbuckle flies, all of which are fully animated. The whole experience includes detailed multi-colour graphics and a full rock soundtrack.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[6051,50457,50036,48599,47750,47589,46256,46089,45402,45329],"tags":[268435460,268435470],"category":0,"genres":[4,14]}
