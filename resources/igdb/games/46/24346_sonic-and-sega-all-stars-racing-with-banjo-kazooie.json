Fan favorites such as Dr. Eggman, Tails, AiAi, Amigo and many more will join Sonic in their custom built vehicles, revving their engines and jostling to stay ahead of the pack. Each character will speed around the track in cars, planes, motorbikes, and in Aiai\u2019s case \u2013 a banana mobile! Secret short cuts, swift handling and avoiding strategically placed obstacles are certainly the best way to get to the top of the podium.","popularity":1,"category":0,"first_release_date":1269302400000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1269302400000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Mar-23","y":2010,"m":3}]}
