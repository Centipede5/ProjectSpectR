Rebelstar Raiders was published in 1984 by Red Shift for the ZX Spectrum.[1] It was reworked in machine code as Rebelstar, published by Firebird in 1986.[2] A sequel, Rebelstar II, was published in 1988 by Silverbird.[3] Rebelstar, but not its sequel, was also adapted for the Amstrad CPC home computer.[4] \n \nEach title in the Rebelstar series is a science fiction-themed turn-based tactics game, in which each player controls an opposing squad of soldiers, using their individual action points for movement, attacking, and other activities. The playing area is top-down plan view, with units shown in profile. The games achieved critical acclaim, and form the beginning of a development history that led to the Laser Squad and X-COM series.[5] \n \nA spiritual successor titled Rebelstar: Tactical Command was developed by Gollop's Codo Technologies and released for the Game Boy Advance by Namco in 2005. Two more Namco projects, Rebelstar: Psionic Rebellion and Rebelstar 2: The Meklon Conspiracy, were cancelled.","collection":2771,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[76731,19099,26766,11582,11550,19301,25300,36950,18811,9789],"tags":[18,268435471,268435472,536871882,536871938,536874694,536875160,536876366,1073741827],"publishers":[11667],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[970,1026,3782,4248,5454],"themes":[18],"genres":[15,16],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":567907200000,"region":1,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ncdln79mfyzxosg7zk7f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ncdln79mfyzxosg7zk7f","width":1000,"height":1573}}
