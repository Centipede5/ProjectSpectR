The film was set in the real world while the game was set in a fictional \"3-D cartoon-like\" reality-city called, \"New Bedford\". The Commando Elite and the Gorgonites awake in a large room on a chest. Chip Hazard criticizes Archer as weak and cowardly, pulls Archer's right arm off, and finally assaults him by using Archer's own right arm, right after Archer informs wisely to Chip Hazard and pushes away from him with the right arm. Archer steals it away and bows before Chip Hazard, jabbing the severed right arm toward Chip Hazard's chest, and hitting Chip's head with the right arm, thus plugging the right arm back into his right shoulder. After the incident both are still arguing but they suddenly both charge at each other, and crash; thus, the PC player must choose their campaign squad.\nThe main campaign for both the Commando Elite and the Gorgonites, is trying to eliminate each other, until they reach the main Small Soldiers Industry, while they are destroying the town itself.\n\nCommando Elite Campaign\n\nThe Commando Elite's plan is to exterminate every isolated Gorgonite scum and non Commando living specimen; if the outcome is victory, the Commando Elite plans to exterminate Washington D.C. and build technological Commando industries for their moment of glory in a new special Commando Militarism Planet.\n\nGorgonite Campaign\nlan is just the opposite to defend every life form cherish freedom, and conservate a melting pot of ecosystems. If the outcome is victory they plan to change the Commando Elite's behavior from changing their micro-chips and uniforms into dainty behaviors and blouses from the Gwendy Doll chips, thus defending the planet and a melting pot of new wild animals in New Bedford.","franchise":632,"franchises":[632],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[9789,8773,30229,18797,22399,19301,302,55029,239,12982],"tags":[18,39,268435467,268435471,536870913,536870926,536871139,536871213,536871470,536871882,536872019,536872352,536872383,536873299,536873822,536874694,536875056,536875118,536875171,536875294,536875358,536876205,536876262,536876415,536876577,536876687,536876706,536876798,536876917,536877209,536877264,536877782,536877937,536879678,536883883,1073741827],"publishers":[183],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1,14,227,301,558,970,1107,1440,1471,2387,2910,3782,4144,4206,4259,4382,4446,5293,5350,5503,5665,5775,5794,5886,6005,6297,6352,6870,7025,8766,12971],"themes":[18,39],"genres":[11,15],"first_release_date":915062400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":915062400000,"human":"1998","y":1998,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/htp1pd89aqcm7hrlpiq8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"htp1pd89aqcm7hrlpiq8","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ywmy4hch2tl4ke4zdodo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ywmy4hch2tl4ke4zdodo","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/df1kows8joh6m42os2qe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"df1kows8joh6m42os2qe","width":300,"height":225},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/js2gxzourzima8hgt8kj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"js2gxzourzima8hgt8kj","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uyufn22cvujkt5hlpgtd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uyufn22cvujkt5hlpgtd","width":640,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jqqaifhp5iu7axeqguts.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jqqaifhp5iu7axeqguts","width":640,"height":772}}
