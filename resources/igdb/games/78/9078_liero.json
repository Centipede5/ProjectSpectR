Pick your five weapons, and unleash your inner fury. The game is always played one versus one on a map of your choice, and yes, you have to play with someone who is right next to you. \n \nTo shoot is of course easy enough to figure out, but if you want to step up your game, you need to figure out things like how to swing yourself to safety with the ninja rope, to use timed weapons for area denial, to hunt without being hunted, to ambush, hit and run, and control that darn guided missile.","rating":82.12289275058299,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":82.12289275058299,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":9,"games":[76747,23852,90099,15536,10039,36950,105049,68287,19561,55038],"tags":[1,268435461,536871041,536871470,536872287,536874743,536874900,536875075,536875262,536875388,536875408,536875483,536875484,536875572,536875573,536875815,536876250,536876365,536876564,536876660,536876687,536879042,536879966,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[129,558,1375,3831,3988,4163,4350,4476,4496,4571,4572,4660,4661,4903,5338,5453,5652,5748,5775,8130,9054],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":915062400000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":915062400000,"region":8,"human":"1998","y":1998,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/j3x7xjsqkmar9vv0rp9y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j3x7xjsqkmar9vv0rp9y","width":640,"height":400}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"KE2XtQaMb5I"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q1wpvz31nvj1ztpv65ya.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q1wpvz31nvj1ztpv65ya","width":200,"height":265},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.liero.be\/"}]}
