Each team is in command of a decrepit flying saucer that seems to work best as a battering ram. It's outer space demolition derby! \n \nOne team is from the ice planet, one from the fire planet. Each team controls a Space Cadet in a zippy little flying saucer. Bump into a sparkling asteroid to send it into the other team's planet. Team with the most hits against its enemy planet wins. \n \nProgrammers at Mattel Electronics came up with a series of casual games meant to be played at parties. The \"Party Line\" cartridge was shown at the 1984 CES but never produced.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"category":0,"first_release_date":886291200000,"platforms":[67],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":67,"date":886291200000,"region":8,"human":"1998-Feb-01","y":1998,"m":2}]}
