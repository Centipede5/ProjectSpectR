The powers of the World are developing in secret the perfect weapons in case that thread snaps. \nThe perfect weapon is and will always be the human mind. Finding and training the perfect soldiers is very hard. These men have to be put in the right situations at the right time and the perfect result is nowhere near the horizon. \nAfter years of research and development the AMRG (American Military Research Group) created virtual reality simulation chambers where highly trained recruits (mind and body), special forces ex-operatives from different countries, will try to find the perfect recipe for the most powerful soldiers. These simulations are based on war era elites covering different fields of operations. These heroes are based on history facts and war stories of special forces operatives from various countries and their bravery and goodwill is now reborn with current day technology.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,25633,32902,30408,68287,103020,105269,28751,29032,36977],"tags":[1,268435461,268435464,268435488,536871595,536871900,536871937,536872159,536873143,536873297,536873304,1073741828],"developers":[13713],"publishers":[13713],"game_engines":[509],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[2,3],"keywords":[683,988,1025,1247,2231,2385,2392],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,8,32],"first_release_date":1513728000000,"status":2,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1513728000000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Dec-20","y":2017,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":8,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/czgscem3gznuh6g14cib.jpg","cloudinary_id":"czgscem3gznuh6g14cib","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yvo0hqfxwzjxdsvpan04.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yvo0hqfxwzjxdsvpan04","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xxmmmwgbb0tqd5g7hkeu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xxmmmwgbb0tqd5g7hkeu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/n8jcpkfyficcx6fz0vcy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"n8jcpkfyficcx6fz0vcy","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ooc3ssxocapiuaocjg4h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ooc3ssxocapiuaocjg4h","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bsqpxpgmekntgh3415aq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bsqpxpgmekntgh3415aq","width":1000,"height":1000},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/712360"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/pvp.studio\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/PlayBoomSquad"},{"category":4,"url":"https:\/\/facebook.com\/PlayBoomSquad"}],"external":{"steam":"712360"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"onlinecoopmax":10}]}
