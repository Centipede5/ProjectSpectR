The four characters can be controlled by one player as a party, or by up to four players, each choosing an action during battles. \n \nThere are four different character classes available: Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, and Hero. The latter can be selected only if he is the only character in the party. Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. Various treasure is scattered around the dungeon; the player also has the option of buying certain equipment. In some places, fountains can be found; drinking from them will affect the party in different ways, positive or negative.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26766,36926,18398,36534,47823,12632,25300,59516,55092,72412],"tags":[268435468,268435487,536871208,536871938,536871939,536876237],"category":0,"keywords":[296,1026,1027,5325],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":381369600000,"platforms":[129],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":129,"date":381369600000,"region":8,"human":"1982-Feb-01","y":1982,"m":2}],"esrb":{"rating":1}}
