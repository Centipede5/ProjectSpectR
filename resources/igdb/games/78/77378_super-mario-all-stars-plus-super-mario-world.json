While games already in the All-Stars bundle have major graphical and audio improvements, the only change made to Super Mario World is a slight tweak of Luigi's graphic sprites, making him slightly thinner and taller (rather than being the same height and stature of Mario) which does not affect gameplay.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"first_release_date":786240000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":786240000000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Dec-01","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hoo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hoo","width":1456,"height":1032},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Super_Mario_All-Stars#Super_Mario_All-Stars_+_Super_Mario_World"}]}
