He's been armed with a gun to retrieve them from 16 levels of side-scrolling platform shooting. \n \nThe gun you start with isn't especially powerful, but various machine guns and flamethrowers can be collected, which make much lighter work of the enemies. Your character can jump and duck responsively, and fire at all angles. \n \nThere are 3 different colours of marbles, which a quota to recover from each level. Collecting enough of each particular colour sees all similar ones turned to coins, which can go towards extra lives and points bonuses. Switches are built into the levels; these act as restart points.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,1070,28029,76246,19341,1073,32902,76229,1188,68287],"tags":[1,268435461,268435464,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t1cpjosrfdq2om16619x.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t1cpjosrfdq2om16619x","width":640,"height":809}}
