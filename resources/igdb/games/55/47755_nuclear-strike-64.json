The plot concerns an elite special force - the player's allies - pursuing a nuclear-armed rogue spy through a fictionalised Asian setting. It retained the earlier game's engine but added several modifications to improve graphical performance and make the game more accessible. The game features 15 playable vehicles, a large increase from previous games. In addition to the main fictionalised Apache, there are secondary helicopters, jets, armour and a hovercraft. The player also commands ground troops in occasional real-time strategy sections.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[5,15],"first_release_date":946771200000,"platforms":[4],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":4,"date":946771200000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jan-02","y":2000,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dum3z1cpwwx5qjubl3pn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dum3z1cpwwx5qjubl3pn","width":2100,"height":1532}}
