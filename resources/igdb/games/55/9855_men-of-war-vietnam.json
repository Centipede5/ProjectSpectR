Two new, story-driven campaigns let you taste the explosive mix of the jungle, Hueys and rock-n-roll in early 1968. \n \nThe US campaign focuses on a team of elite special ops soldiers, and each one of them has a personality. The unit includes Sergeant John Merrill, machinegunner Jim Walsh, sniper Sonny Armstrong, grenade launcher operator Carl Dillan and combat engineer Bill Kirby. In some missions they can count only on themselves, while in the others they act together with regular US and South-Vietnamese troops. \n \nThe North Vietnam campaign tells the story of two Soviet military consultants and two soldiers of the North Vietnam Army who are the only survivors of an ambush prepared by the US troops. The task of getting back to the North Vietnam territory is a difficult one - they have no means of radio communication, no wheeled vehicles, and it's too far to make it there on foot. On their way these survivors get involved in a chain of bloodbath engagements and find themselves in the dead center of the well-known Tet offensive. \n \nMissions range from special operations to full scale battles.","collection":245,"rating":50,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":50,"total_rating_count":2,"rating_count":2,"games":[30229,22399,55029,12982,36594,6985,11423,848,8773,327],"tags":[22,39,268435467,268435471,268435480,536870914,536870920,536871438,536871546,536871595,536871905,536872070,536872383,536874182,536874916,536875046,536875610,536876262,536876569,536876933,536877264,536877501,536877511,536877741,536877820,536878027,536879624,536880176,536880617,536881345,536882079,536882943,536883276,1073741826],"developers":[157,1703],"publishers":[157,1117],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[2,8,526,634,683,993,1158,1471,3270,4004,4134,4698,5350,5657,6021,6352,6589,6599,6829,6908,7115,8712,9264,9705,10433,11167,12031,12364],"themes":[22,39],"genres":[11,15,24],"first_release_date":1315526400000,"platforms":[6,92],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1315526400000,"human":"2011-Sep-09","y":2011,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1315526400000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Sep-09","y":2011,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bt44a72mgyguzusktbm6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bt44a72mgyguzusktbm6","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sjmcxfjwnmin8xpbtpxo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sjmcxfjwnmin8xpbtpxo","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p5ohlqi0isnptelfbszf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p5ohlqi0isnptelfbszf","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mzzlalira0yjtyiz1rbo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mzzlalira0yjtyiz1rbo","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yu70mkpc6nx7krgev7ym.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yu70mkpc6nx7krgev7ym","width":1680,"height":1050}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"4oPs9bXbsJ0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bqwaoan0sxhrbtuxjlrd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bqwaoan0sxhrbtuxjlrd","width":354,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a real-time strategy game in which players command both Russian and American forces during the Vietnam War.
