{"id":255,"name":"Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura","slug":"arcanum-of-steamworks-and-magick-obscura","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/arcanum-of-steamworks-and-magick-obscura","created_at":1300350354000,"updated_at":1548774471572,"summary":"Imagine a place of wonder,where magic and technology hold equal sway, and an adventurer might just as easily wield a flintlock pistol as a flaming sword. A place where great industrial cities house castle keeps and factories, home to Dwarves, Humans, Orcs and Elves alike. A place of ancient runes and steamworks, of magic and machines, of sorcery and science.\n\nArcanum is the first game to come from the development house Troika Games, LLC, started by former Fallout team members Tim Cain, Leonard Boyarsky, and Jason Anderson. This team takes the depth of gameplay and world-building in role-playing games to entirely new levels of realism and excitement.\n\nArcanum creates a compelling new world where magic and technology coexist in an uneasy balance. As Arcanum opens, the mechanical age has only recently arrived in this ancient land where Humans, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and other races have learned to survive in the new sprawling industrialized cities. But this radical shift from magic to technology has created a potentially explosive situation. As the townspeople and other thinkers begin mass production of light bulbs, batteries, eyeglasses and guns, the Mages grow leery. This tightly wound setting is the starting point from which the character must set out on his quest.","storyline":"Arcanum begins with a cut scene of the IFS Zephyr, a luxury zeppelin, on her maiden voyage from Caladon to Tarant. Two monoplanes, piloted by Half-Ogre bandits, close in on the craft and commence attack runs, succeeding in shooting it down. An old gnome who is a passenger aboard the Zephyr is now in his death throes under charred debris and tells the player to bring a silver ring to \"the boy,\" and promptly dies. Being the only survivor of the crash, the main character is proclaimed as \"The Living One,\" a holy reincarnate, by the only witness to the crash, Virgil. The story follows the player's path as he searches for the origin of the ring.","rating":90.4326771696236,"popularity":12.33333333333333,"total_rating":90.4326771696236,"total_rating_count":54,"rating_count":54,"games":[1593,2004,6,5652,76,5550,2933,18337,216,1223],"tags":[17,18,268435468,268435471,268435472,536871138,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871409,536871422,536871504,536871818,536871938,536872184,536872225,536872260,536872352,536872371,536872435,536872647,536872690,536872746,536872810,536872847,536872898,536872978,536873066,536873364,536873863,536874136,536874182,536874398,536874694,536875059,536875151,536875196,536875257,536875265,536875304,536875305,536875311,536875358,536875361,536875455,536875483,536875488,536875531,536875572,536875735,536875762,536875765,536875774,536875779,536875791,536875792,536875803,536875822,536875941,536876262,536876606,536876662,536876847,536876882,536876974,536877155,536877207,536877209,536877519,536877554,536877593,536877595,536877597,536877600,536877645,536877990,536878421,536878494,536878535,536879713,536880182,536880218,536880638,536880836,536880839,536882084,536883035,536884030,1073741827],"developers":[117],"publishers":[24],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[226,227,296,301,497,510,592,906,1026,1272,1313,1348,1440,1459,1523,1735,1778,1834,1898,1935,1986,2066,2154,2452,2951,3224,3270,3486,3782,4147,4239,4284,4345,4353,4392,4393,4399,4446,4449,4543,4571,4576,4619,4660,4823,4850,4853,4862,4867,4879,4880,4891,4910,5029,5350,5694,5750,5935,5970,6062,6243,6295,6297,6607,6642,6681,6683,6685,6688,6733,7078,7509,7582,7623,8801,9270,9306,9726,9924,9927,11172,12123,13118],"themes":[17,18],"genres":[12,15,16],"first_release_date":998352000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":998352000000,"human":"2001-Aug-21","y":2001,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Arcanum"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jkzai4iyuf2z3v21d0rt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jkzai4iyuf2z3v21d0rt","width":710,"height":533},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/igep7wj3syqmxqdvkqxk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"igep7wj3syqmxqdvkqxk","width":710,"height":533},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/isdo1nug5ximfgdb5stj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"isdo1nug5ximfgdb5stj","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k961xkkr0mqsh1zczwcu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k961xkkr0mqsh1zczwcu","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xxm75p7feap3th2ump7m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xxm75p7feap3th2ump7m","width":800,"height":600}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"O5ImMBWGc_w"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/e3kkmmndibrcub82lnqi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e3kkmmndibrcub82lnqi","width":324,"height":384},"esrb":{"rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.activision.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/500810"}],"external":{"steam":"500810"}}
