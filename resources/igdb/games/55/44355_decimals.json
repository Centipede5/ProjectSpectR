The Milliken Math Sequences, along with the TI Home Computer, can help your child meet these challenges. The series allows children to work at their own pace and on the skill level at which they need practice. Children find that learning with the computer is fun, challenging, and motivating. The computer never tires of repetition or loses patience \u2014 it's like having a private math tutor! The Milliken Math Sequences, developed for Texas Instruments by Milliken Publishing Company, consists of twelve Solid State Cartridges. Each cartridge concentrates on a different skill area in mathematics, such as addition, subtraction, decimals, or fractions. By providing different levels of difficulty, the series is suitable for children from the kindergarten age through grade eight. The Decimals cartridge is divided into 56 levels of difficulty, covering material generally taught in grades five through eight. The program provides practice in recognizing decimals as fractions, determining the order of decimals, rounding decimals, and doing arithmetic with decimals. Children add, subtract, multiply, and divide while developing the special skills involved in working with decimal numbers. This program assumes that your child has mastered basic arithmetic and a certain degree of mental computation.","popularity":1,"category":0}
