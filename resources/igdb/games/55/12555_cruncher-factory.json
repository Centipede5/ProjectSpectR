{"id":12555,"name":"Cruncher Factory","slug":"cruncher-factory","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/cruncher-factory","created_at":1442350041929,"updated_at":1500198437072,"summary":"Cruncher Factory is a Pac-Man variant. The player commands a cruncher (which looks exactly like Pac-Man) and steers him through non-scrolling labyrinths shown from the side. On every place not occupied with a wall are pills which have to be eaten by rolling over the field they are on. There are also ghosts which cause the player to lose a life when touched - at least until the cruncher eats a special ball which causes him to eat the ghosts. A level is won when all balls are eaten. \n \nThe game features 100 levels, a level editor (can be also used to change the existing levels) and a two-player mode.","popularity":2,"games":[25646,51485,36794,7559,36608,34919,40971,12266,24199,16468],"tags":[1,268435465,268435489,536871323,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[411],"themes":[1],"genres":[9,33],"first_release_date":567907200000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":567907200000,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c6bfyz8vbdiq1cffcrqr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c6bfyz8vbdiq1cffcrqr","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pwsrazk7xpvu0wr3jxp7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pwsrazk7xpvu0wr3jxp7","width":320,"height":256},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nvebmbumuiwwbrdg8bhd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nvebmbumuiwwbrdg8bhd","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hifdtvuy7onjlalwlb6b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hifdtvuy7onjlalwlb6b","width":566,"height":856}}
