The game begins with a first person full motion video, in which the player drinks spoiled milk and collapses onto the table. This launches a puzzle game in which the player must complete a series of minigames to obtain clues to \"escape\" their situation. The player is spoken to in various phone calls by an unseen third party and given hints to complete the puzzles. Clues are hidden in FMV clips including a \"dismembered bald head, a disembodied voice, a drowning man, and chronic smokers\", and often use reversed audio.","popularity":2,"games":[36044,25222,13189,65503,22425,103312,33269,28309,59218,26298],"tags":[268435487,536871939,536875541,536876663,1073741829],"developers":[16068],"publishers":[16068],"game_engines":[589],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[203,1027,1416,4629,5751],"genres":[2,9,31],"first_release_date":973036800000,"platforms":[6,14],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":973036800000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Nov-01","y":2000,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":973036800000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Nov-01","y":2000,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rmbzonduxnvtattivyrk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rmbzonduxnvtattivyrk","width":468,"height":359}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"-Ve569GjY5M"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"kz8SGdKBd2o"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hwp5talx15i6zn6npocl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hwp5talx15i6zn6npocl","width":800,"height":678},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bad_Milk"}]}
