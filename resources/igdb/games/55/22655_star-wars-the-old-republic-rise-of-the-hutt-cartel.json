Seeing the Empire weakened, Toborro decides to continue Karagga's campaign of expansion, but with the planet Makeb at the heart of a new era of Hutt conquest\u2014for Makeb is home to deposits of the incredibly rare and powerful mineral known as isotope-5. Isotope-5 is capable of warping electromagnetic and gravitational fields, and a gram of the substance can generate immense amounts of power. Toborro therefore pays off Makeb's defense force, the mercenary army known as the InterStellar Regulators, to help the Hutts conquer the world, and the Cartel blockades the Makeb system as Toborro begins to mine the isotope-5 in Makeb's core without any regard for what it would do to the planet.","collection":2380,"franchise":1,"franchises":[1],"popularity":2,"aggregated_rating":63,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":63,"total_rating_count":1,"game":114,"games":[25311,27922,26766,18811,25300,49414,36608,16468,25636,19448],"tags":[18,268435468,536871453,536872449,536874842,1073741826],"developers":[3845],"publishers":[10,1],"game_engines":[87],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[541,1537,3930],"themes":[18],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1365897600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1365897600000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Apr-14","y":2013,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"RotHC","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ttrcykurpp8zjuoxslda.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ttrcykurpp8zjuoxslda","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cxfqeszwhfczoarweey6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cxfqeszwhfczoarweey6","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vluw4srqlaafwct0jgqu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vluw4srqlaafwct0jgqu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hw6nmv9zcuttpmryjrh2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hw6nmv9zcuttpmryjrh2","width":1589,"height":896},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/unswvaeq5aljjgj7gypu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"unswvaeq5aljjgj7gypu","width":480,"height":273}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"DWGAy3beick"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xer9ggckvj8mfrigm9ji.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xer9ggckvj8mfrigm9ji","width":1013,"height":1500},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/swtor.wikia.com\/wiki\/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic:_Knights_of_the_Fallen_Empire"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.swtor.com\/rothc"}]}
