Their plan is to save the badly polluted planet Smeaton Five by destroying its robotic defences and the computer primed to explode it. \n \nMany enemies must be shot down along the way, but most release credits when shot \u2013 wait a few seconds for these to appear. You have three lives, with each rat representing a life, which means that all upgrades are lost when you lose a life, and each rat\u2019s protective biosphere has the ability to withstand a few shots. Before heading into the action, you can spend your initial 500 credits on upgrades and weaponry. Your movement features a degree of inertia, making it harder to stop short of a position.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[68287,71455,36781,25300,36950,142,64204,34919,36608,27314],"tags":[1,536870981,536871882,536871937,536875870,536876120],"category":0,"keywords":[69,970,1025,4958,5208],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":717897600000,"platforms":[16],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":16,"date":717897600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Oct-01","y":1992,"m":10}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zow9cxdyzsxcmvfppd9j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zow9cxdyzsxcmvfppd9j","width":500,"height":400}}
