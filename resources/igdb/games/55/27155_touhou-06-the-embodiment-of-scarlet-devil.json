Reimu Hakurei can cover a wide area of the screen with weaker attacks, while Marisa Kirisame relies on her speed and power to make up for her thinner attack spread. The bombs show different behavior and damage depending on the character and type chosen. \n \nUnlike its predecessor, Mystic Square, Embodiment of Scarlet Devil comes with an \"automatic item collection\" feature, which allows you to collect all items on the screen by moving to the top of the screen if you are at full power, as well as a counter-bomb system, which allows you to avoid a fatal hit by using a bomb immediately. \n \nThough there are six total stages in the main game, playing on Easy will end the game after Stage 5.","storyline":"During a peaceful summer in Gensokyo, an unnatural scarlet mist appears without warning and covers much of the land.

Reimu Hakurei, a shrine maiden working at the Hakurei Shrine, and Marisa Kirisame, a magician, set out to find the source of the mist. Their search will lead them to the Scarlet Devil Mansion and to its eccentric owners...","collection":2093,"franchise":780,"franchises":[780],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[23852,27209,45967,23733,54775,22387,55038,45966,68441,45963],"tags":[1,17,268435461,536870990,536871029,536871078,536871138,536871208,536871738,536871823,536872225,536873476,536874055,536874259,536874398,536875941,536876634,536877027,536878105,536879840,536879841,536880962,536881907,536881908,536881909,1073741827],"developers":[9378],"publishers":[9378],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,117,166,226,296,826,911,1313,2564,3143,3347,3486,5029,5722,6115,7193,8928,8929,10050,10995,10996,10997],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1029024000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1029024000000,"region":5,"human":"2002-Aug-11","y":2002,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Touhou Koumakyou - Embodiment of Scarlet Devil","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"EoSD","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"Th06","comment":"Acronym"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ascbfiy6of0dvbujjjim.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ascbfiy6of0dvbujjjim","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"KJXUt9H9OZM"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xfysgnqqtsfjopvxtkcy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xfysgnqqtsfjopvxtkcy","width":256,"height":253},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/touhou.wikia.com\/wiki\/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www16.big.or.jp\/~zun\/html\/th06.html"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.touhouwiki.net\/wiki\/Embodiment_of_Scarlet_Devil"}]}
