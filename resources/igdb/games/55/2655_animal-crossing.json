Players begin the game by setting out to live life on their own in a colorful town, where they are greeted by a seemingly endless supply of things to do and characters to meet.\n\nTime passes in Animal Crossing in real-time, as the month, day, season, and time of day matches that of the player's. Holiday seasons come and go in Animal Crossing, just as they would in the real world. Experience the freedom to fish, decorate your house, go bug catching, garden, write letters, and even play original Nintendo NES games in this imaginative, and addictive game.","collection":521,"rating":75.5021794308298,"popularity":19,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":77.7510897154149,"total_rating_count":35,"rating_count":34,"games":[28558,26563,101573,3278,107232,106008,82117,79134,28277,27744],"tags":[33,268435469,536870955,1073741827],"developers":[421],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[43],"themes":[33],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":1008288000000,"pulse_count":13,"platforms":[21],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1008288000000,"region":5,"human":"2001-Dec-14","y":2001,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1032048000000,"region":2,"human":"2002-Sep-15","y":2002,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1066348800000,"region":3,"human":"2003-Oct-17","y":2003,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1095984000000,"region":1,"human":"2004-Sep-24","y":2004,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Animal Crossing"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vhpcfoetrfbmvznovg6v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vhpcfoetrfbmvznovg6v","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dediwadw3vwurrcdodc5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dediwadw3vwurrcdodc5","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/smcboybvcjijlenojl79.jpg","cloudinary_id":"smcboybvcjijlenojl79","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bwhzcusldk2z5mbmn5kh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bwhzcusldk2z5mbmn5kh","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kh1d0asirrpszulxodag.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kh1d0asirrpszulxodag","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/r1zsdyp097c8wjakvhhq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"r1zsdyp097c8wjakvhhq","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/oxubrjpt5bzzm44ratlp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oxubrjpt5bzzm44ratlp","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/d63d56jchpcrcqaf60pn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d63d56jchpcrcqaf60pn","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/b9ipp0tuobi9zh8hetu5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"b9ipp0tuobi9zh8hetu5","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p2otj88pc8j5zipjs7n4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p2otj88pc8j5zipjs7n4","width":480,"height":381},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u7obvapsx05gqstrt56j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u7obvapsx05gqstrt56j","width":438,"height":348},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ajsdgh4rh7jyjueyboft.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ajsdgh4rh7jyjueyboft","width":885,"height":663}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"fNxjGDGBYlg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vflxe2qwxcwenvc3p6ly.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vflxe2qwxcwenvc3p6ly","width":257,"height":358},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
