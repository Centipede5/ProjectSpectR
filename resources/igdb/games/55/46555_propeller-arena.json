It was originally titled Propeller Head Online,[1] and was to be released on 9\/19\/2001.[2] The game was trademarked on 8\/14\/2001.[3] It was developed and completed by the development team Sega AM2,[4] but the game was never officially released.[5] The release was cancelled[6] just days after the September 11 attacks,[7] citing both similarities in game packaging and design to the events of that day[8][9][10][11] as well as the Dreamcast's declining market share[12] resulting in projected low sales numbers. \n \nThe game was on display at E3 on May 19, 2001.[13] After it was postponed, they were working to change the game cover art to remove sensitive images.[14] \n \nHopes of a port to another console never materialized. However, a disk image of the game was eventually leaked,[15] and became a popular[16] download on many peer-to-peer networks.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[34919,25311,19341,54999,19934,28465,37419,44242,55715,36608],"tags":[1,268435469,536870937,536870968,536871904,536874539,536876252],"category":0,"keywords":[25,56,992,3627,5340],"themes":[1],"genres":[13],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y8vb40wzxwjn8qab0fu0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y8vb40wzxwjn8qab0fu0","width":500,"height":500}}
