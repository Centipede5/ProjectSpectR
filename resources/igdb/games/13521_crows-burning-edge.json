The game will take place at the notorious Suzuran All-Boys High School, where Harumichi Boya is a recent transfer student. Harumichi is the kind of person who is devoted to fighting fairly, but it seems the other boys at the school aren\u2019t as gracious. The game won\u2019t only feature the thugs and delinquents from Suzaran High, however. Groups and gangs from Hosen Academy, the Kurotaki Alliance and the Front of Armament will showcase their fighting abilities as well.","franchise":692,"franchises":[692],"hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23175,59516,55752,55289,10039,25646,25311,19658,37022,55803],"tags":[1,268435460,268435487,536870990,536871019,536871894,536872416,536872479,536873560,1073741826],"developers":[5024],"publishers":[5024],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,107,982,1504,1567,2648],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,31],"first_release_date":1477526400000,"platforms":[48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1477526400000,"region":5,"human":"2016-Oct-27","y":2016,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u6f02\u4e3f\u7537\u5b50\u6f22 \u71c3\u71d2\u908a\u7de3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"cZCWi1jK9ik"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"774EjJLfzjM"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"XRc1yBpLWRA"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wqmsriuwrbh9ogyyllig.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wqmsriuwrbh9ogyyllig","width":400,"height":240},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/crows-game.bn-ent.net\/"}]}
