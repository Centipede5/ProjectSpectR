{"id":30598,"name":"Green Mirror","slug":"green-mirror","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/green-mirror","created_at":1495549128610,"updated_at":1523369057361,"summary":"Green Mirror is a 2D point-and-click horror adventure with clear Lovecraftian influences that combines the classic gameplay of these games with some new mechanics that enrich it, as well as exploration sections that will submerge us in possible secondary contents that are developed aside from the main story, complementing it. \n \nFollowing the disappearance of a family while hiking in the forests of Steelrock Canyon National Park, Dylan Riley, a veteran member of the search and rescue unit, suffers an accident that leaves him alone in the middle of the night and lost in an unexplored zone of the woods that has been closed to the public because of the dangers it may harbor. But... Is he really alone? Shadows glide through the trees, watching him, strange whispers accompany his steps like a creepy leitmotiv, and something that has inhabited those woods for eons wants to make it clear that he is not welcomed there. \n \nMain Features: \n \nAtmospheric exploration - The forest that covers the natural reserve like a green mantle hides many secrets and dangers buried by the time, that's the reason why many of its zones have been declared closed to the public. It's been a long time since the forgotten paths that wind through the undergrowth have been walked ... until now. \n \nPuzzle Solving - There are many hidden mysteries in the dark corners of Steelrock Canyon's forest waiting to be unveiled, old knowledge yearning to be pronounced again, and more complex motivations than it may seem at first. \n \nSurvive! - Take care of your wounds, seek help and escape the threats that wait for you in every corner. It seems as if the forest around you is alive ... and you can not trust it.","storyline":"Following the disappearance of a family while hiking in the forests of Steelrock Canyon National Park, Dylan Riley, a veteran member of the search and rescue unit, suffers an accident that leaves him alone in the middle of the night and lost in an unexplored zone of the woods that has been closed to the public because of the dangers it may harbor.
