Two new Japanese characters were added to the roster of fighters: Aoi Umenokoji, a beautiful Japanese woman and a childhood friend of Akira Yuki who used a nimble form of Aiki-jujutsu as her fighting style of choice, and Taka-Arashi, a Sumo wrestler from Japan. Taka Arashi would not make another appearance in the Virtua Fighter series until Virtua Fighter 5 R; the series' current producer, Hiroshi Kataoka explained that the removal of Taka in subsequent installments was due to the technical implications of having a substantially larger character.","collection":318,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[1552,22239,19734,1244,1555,1549,1564,1546,1242,1389],"tags":[1,268435460,268435489,536870973,536871019,536871076,536871213,536871881,536871889,536871910,536872352,536872983,536873064,536874907,536875073,536875178,536875198,536875271,536875435,536875436,536875490,536875803,536875815,536876216,536876266,536876574,536876596,536876735,536876803,536876816,536876818,536876823,536876854,536877012,536877016,536877280,536877441,536877444,536877446,536877447,536877448,536877986,536879963,536880571,536882361,536882678,536882932,536884031,536884033,536884224,536884403,536885901,1073741828],"developers":[830,1804],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[61,107,164,301,969,977,998,1440,2071,2152,3995,4161,4266,4286,4359,4523,4524,4578,4891,4903,5304,5354,5662,5684,5823,5891,5904,5906,5911,5942,6100,6104,6368,6529,6532,6534,6535,6536,7074,9051,9659,11449,11766,12020,13119,13121,13312,13491,14989],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,33],"first_release_date":873072000000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[52,23],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":52,"date":873072000000,"region":5,"human":"1997-Sep","y":1997,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":912124800000,"region":5,"human":"1998-Nov-27","y":1998,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":939859200000,"region":1,"human":"1999-Oct-14","y":1999,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":23,"date":940204800000,"region":2,"human":"1999-Oct-18","y":1999,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Virtua Fighter 3tb\nVF3","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc3","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Virtua Fighter 3tb","comment":"Dreamcast title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/thmucvfez2vtxqlbiucs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"thmucvfez2vtxqlbiucs","width":850,"height":1223},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
