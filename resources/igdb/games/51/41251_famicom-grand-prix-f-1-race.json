Cars have a certain amount of health and fuel, which decreases whenever the player crashes into a wall or another car, as well as whenever he or she drives off of the road. The player can go to a pit-stop to regenerate the health and fuel; however, doing this takes away race time. Winning the Grand Prix rewards players with coins (Money), which can be used to unlock hidden cars.","collection":2960,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[40470,28856,55192,54789,73708,48498,36662,73969,71689,69538],"tags":[268435466,536875069,536875258,536876108,536876749],"category":0,"keywords":[4157,4346,5196,5837],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":565228800000,"platforms":[58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":565228800000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Nov-30","y":1987,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rc8kahvojenwmcdifnez.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rc8kahvojenwmcdifnez","width":939,"height":1111}}
