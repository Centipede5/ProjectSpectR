It resembles baseball, complete with a diamond of bases to around, but the \"batting\" player is actually kicking the ball. The rest of the game plays like a normal round of baseball. \n \nIt features seven characters - each of which represents a team of identical athletes - each with their own special pitch\/kick move. These characters also include the two protagonists from the Kaizou Choujin Shubibinman series: Tasuke and Kyapiko (or Arnold and Sonia, as they're known in Shockman). Each team also has an assigned stadium that fits their theme: the seal team, for instance, have a stadium with an ice-like floor.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":661910400000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":661910400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Dec-23","y":1990,"m":12}]}
