The key difference between Dungeonbowl and Blood Bowl as is rather obvious from the name, is that Dungeonbowl is played in a dungeon! \n \nThe game also introduces some subtle modifications to the standard Blood Bowl rules. A match is still played between two teams, but each side is composed of three races. For example, the roster of a Rainbow Wizards team contains Wood Elves, Halflings and Humans.","collection":869,"franchise":509,"franchises":[509],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[11423,19407,21429,18918,19376,16513,28028,6732,18167,932],"tags":[17,268435470,268435471,536871008,536871208,536872070,536872078,536872272,536872978,536874694,536874916,536875046,536875062,536875063,536878499,536879708],"developers":[7613],"publishers":[7613],"category":0,"game_modes":[2],"keywords":[96,296,1158,1166,1360,2066,3782,4004,4134,4150,4151,7587,8796],"themes":[17],"genres":[14,15],"first_release_date":1339113600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1339113600000,"human":"2012-Jun-08","y":2012,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yqrrslmwm6jxg4odjxqe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yqrrslmwm6jxg4odjxqe","width":1000,"height":300}}
