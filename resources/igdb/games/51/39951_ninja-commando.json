The players can choose between three ninja characters, all with differing abilities. Each of them has fighting game-style[1] input commands that unleash their scroll-based ninpo special moves. As usual in the genre, the game's stages end with boss battles.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10039,68287,28029,55752,76229,76246,19341,1070,26761,36781],"tags":[1,268435461,268435464,536870973,536871076,536871937,536872961,536875167],"publishers":[13786],"category":0,"keywords":[61,164,1025,2049],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":696643200000,"platforms":[80,136,79],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":783561600000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Oct-31","y":1994,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":696729600000,"region":2,"human":"1992-Jan-30","y":1992,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":696643200000,"region":2,"human":"1992-Jan-29","y":1992,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":136,"date":783561600000,"region":5,"human":"1994-Oct-31","y":1994,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":79,"date":696729600000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jan-30","y":1992,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":696643200000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jan-29","y":1992,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":80,"date":696643200000,"region":1,"human":"1992-Jan-29","y":1992,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lytuiae3qp9j4irmiori.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lytuiae3qp9j4irmiori","width":600,"height":498}}
