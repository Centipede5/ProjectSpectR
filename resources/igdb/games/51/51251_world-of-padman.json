Originally it was a modification for the game Quake III Arena titled PadMod created in the year 2004. After the source code for Quake III Arena was released, the game became standalone. The idea is based on the Padman comic strip for the magazine PlayStation Games created by the professional cartoon artist Andreas 'ENTE' (German for \"Duck\") Endres, who is also the man who made many of the maps included with the game in 1998. The current version runs on an enhanced version of the ioquake3 engine, which is based on the Quake III Arena engine.","collection":3538,"popularity":1,"games":[29173,54662,19341,55590,55689,44076,34919,44242,19934,40470],"tags":[1,268435461,268435469,268435470,536870973,536871906,536871998,536872060,536872078],"category":0,"keywords":[61,994,1086,1148,1166],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,13,14],"first_release_date":1177977600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1177977600000,"region":8,"human":"2007-May-01","y":2007,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cnq3bxisqplhbotojyfh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cnq3bxisqplhbotojyfh","width":256,"height":256},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/World_of_Padman"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/worldofpadman.net\/"}]}
