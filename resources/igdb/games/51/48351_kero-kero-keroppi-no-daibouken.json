Released on the Nintendo Family Computer console in Japan in 1991. \n \nBig Adventure is a children's puzzle game where Keroppi must rescue his girlfriend Keroleen who is locked up in a castle. To do so, he must solve the action based puzzles in seven differently themed worlds with four different types of stages (the surface of the maze, flying a plane, a Reversi-like level, and through a field of lava). All the items in the game are pre-determined; there is a need to memorize the pattern for each playthrough so that a player may advance through the levels more quickly once they have achieved a degree of expertise in the game.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25222,25646,60044,26223,14047,56292,34919,36608,37094,16468],"tags":[1,268435465,536871581,536872475,536873787,536875074,536875394],"category":0,"keywords":[669,1563,2875,4162,4482],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":672883200000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":672883200000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Apr-29","y":1991,"m":4}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y1ymgzrdylqow7anrwxd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y1ymgzrdylqow7anrwxd","width":420,"height":295}}
