You are the owner of a large, very unpopular parking area and an armada of breakdown trucks for large as well as small vehicles. With this kind of work you can make good money, because car owners have to pay a pretty penny to redeem their car. So it's high time to get on the gravy train. But watch out - you have to drive the tow truck yourself and in narrow streets car body damage happens too easily. Such incidents are not only annoying but also expensive. Only those who get their job done quickly and accident-free can expand their business. \n \nA special 3D graphics engine enables a clear and realistic presentation of all events. Step by step, you gain experience and therefore you constantly receive more profitable orders that require your full attention and skills. \n \nA level is considered to be solved if, within the given time, the specific tasks have been fulfilled. But watch out, other events always affect the current game run. Throughout the game\u2019s run you receive new tools, machines and experience points.
