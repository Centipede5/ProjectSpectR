The human player always plays at the bottom of the screen, there's no change of sides. Every match follows the same rules as one player has to win three games to win the match. When a match is levelled at 2-2 one player needs to win two games in a row to win.","popularity":1,"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":1167523200000,"platforms":[82],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":82,"date":1167523200000,"human":"2006","y":2006,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hc7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hc7","width":819,"height":819},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.gamedesign.jp\/flash\/tennis\/tennis.html"}]}
