A kicks, C jumps. Pressing C twice causes the player to attack blocks underneath the player. Pressing B while next to a stone block allows the player to pick it up, and then he\/she can drop it with the same button. \n \nPressing C + Start causes the level to reset. A + Start allows you to skip the level, though this can only be used three times during the course of the game.","popularity":1,"games":[55173,56033,24426,20342,19241,60044,19150,20329,25222,60230],"tags":[268435464,268435465,536871277,536872961,536873787,536875046,536879971],"category":0,"keywords":[365,2049,2875,4134,9059],"genres":[8,9],"first_release_date":665366400000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":665366400000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-01","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rdqmph7gf4zdgps0itah.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rdqmph7gf4zdgps0itah","width":640,"height":448}}
