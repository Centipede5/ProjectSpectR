It is developed by Rare and published by Tradewest. It was originally released for Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991, with ports for the Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear, Amiga CD32 and Nintendo Game Boy (with the subtitle Battletoads in Ragnarok's World so as to separate it from the earlier-released Game Boy sequel). \n \nBattletoads is considered to be a game that shows the true potential of the NES' graphics, mainly due to the year of its release, when developers were focusing more on 16-bit consoles. \n \nNot only is it graphically-advanced, but it is also considered to be one of the hardest games of all time, appearing in possibly every listing of difficult video games. It is currently listen at 8th place in IGN's \"Top 10 Most Difficult Games to Beat.\"\n\nIt was re released in 2015 on the Xbox One as part of the Rare Replay Collection.","storyline":"Fresh from her recent defeat at the Battle of Canis Major, the Dark Queen decides to take out her aggressions on her archenemies, the Battletoads. The 'Toads and their mentor, Professor T-Bird, are currently escorting Princess Angelica home to her father, the Terran Emperor. During a rest stop, Pimple takes Angelica out for a drive in the Toadster, but the vehicle and its occupants are swallowed up by the Dark Queen's ship, the Gargantua, and taken to her tower on planet Ragnarok. \nRash and Zitz are quickly sent down to Ragnarok's surface to rescue their friends, unaware of the dangers that await them, but willing to chance it all on their rescue mission.","collection":545,"rating":86.0516077013802,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"total_rating":86.0516077013802,"total_rating_count":34,"rating_count":34,"games":[78513,4598,6840,14697,7558,1185,9806,3186,71,2933],"tags":[1,18,27,268435464,268435481,536870915,536871015,536871041,536871065,536871208,536871213,536871262,536871353,536871354,536871470,536871487,536871859,536871882,536871889,536871894,536871971,536872234,536872622,536872666,536872961,536873064,536873991,536874139,536874182,536874398,536874653,536874743,536875056,536875073,536875074,536875088,536875159,536875200,536875201,536875202,536875214,536875216,536875281,536875319,536875413,536875453,536875461,536875470,536875517,536875526,536875610,536875655,536875672,536875803,536875857,536875870,536875908,536875941,536875942,536876008,536876028,536876087,536876120,536876348,536876355,536876357,536876415,536876619,536876634,536876665,536876713,536876731,536877072,536877101,536877283,536877405,536877801,536877954,536878192,536878561,536878596,536878598,536879816,536880028,536880208,536880227,536880568,536881456,536881662,536882445,536883126,536885402,1073741828],"developers":[771,1218,489],"publishers":[1384,489],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[3,103,129,153,296,301,350,441,442,558,575,947,970,977,982,1059,1322,1710,1754,2049,2152,3079,3227,3270,3486,3741,3831,4144,4161,4162,4176,4247,4288,4289,4290,4302,4304,4369,4407,4501,4541,4549,4558,4605,4614,4698,4743,4760,4891,4945,4958,4996,5029,5030,5096,5116,5175,5208,5436,5443,5445,5503,5707,5722,5753,5801,5819,6160,6189,6371,6493,6889,7042,7280,7649,7684,7686,8904,9116,9296,9315,9656,10544,10750,11533,12214,14490],"themes":[1,18,27],"genres":[8,25],"first_release_date":675734400000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[29,35,114,16,49,33,18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":693187200000,"region":5,"human":"1991-Dec-20","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":729993600000,"region":1,"human":"1993-Feb-18","y":1993,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":675734400000,"region":2,"human":"1991-Jun-01","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":33,"date":675734400000,"human":"1991-Jun-01","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":675734400000,"human":"1991-Jun-01","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":675734400000,"human":"1991-Jun-01","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":675734400000,"human":"1991-Jun-01","y":1991,"m":6},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":114,"date":788832000000,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1438646400000,"human":"2015-Aug-04","y":2015,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rmrbb2e2mhv1cnmuoykv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rmrbb2e2mhv1cnmuoykv","width":468,"height":327}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"nwCU9SwybEg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mssssrw0th8cfxiynayu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mssssrw0th8cfxiynayu","width":1534,"height":2100},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/battletoads.wikia.com\/wiki\/Main_Page"}]}
