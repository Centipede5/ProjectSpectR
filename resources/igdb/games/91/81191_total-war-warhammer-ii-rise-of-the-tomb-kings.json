It is a lifeless realm of endless dunes, stained red from the blood of savages and barbarians. This is the Land of the Dead, where mummified kings are cursed to rule in perpetual unlife. But it was not always thus. \n \nThere was a time when the ancient kingdom of Nehekhara stood as a crown of human civilisation; a golden age when its cities shone with majestic splendour, its armies conquered entire nations and its kings ruled as gods among men. But this realm was razed millennia ago by the treacherous sorcery of reviled Nagash: in a stroke, the living perished and the dead rose from their tombs. \n \nDeath is no barrier to glory for the Tomb Kings however. In unlife, they will see the empire of Nehekhara restored to greatness!","collection":2651,"franchise":977,"franchises":[977,509],"popularity":1,"game":28028,"games":[16468,13196,25311,28010,5613,36608,17583,37088,47823,12632],"tags":[1,17,268435467,268435468,268435471,268435472,1073741827],"developers":[111],"publishers":[112],"category":1,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[11,12,15,16],"first_release_date":1516665600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1516665600000,"region":2,"human":"2018-Jan-23","y":2018,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1516665600000,"region":1,"human":"2018-Jan-23","y":2018,"m":1}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x1bwwu451oyjlmit2st7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x1bwwu451oyjlmit2st7","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/k0k5drbvo72x7kfrth4c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k0k5drbvo72x7kfrth4c","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hp69rx4pts2c0iiiewbs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hp69rx4pts2c0iiiewbs","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dykhjml3pdjc7efsids2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dykhjml3pdjc7efsids2","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qrawcsac2d4lsjfmzkev.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qrawcsac2d4lsjfmzkev","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"IpWqKme-g_4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kccesfeizz2996bu86q0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kccesfeizz2996bu86q0","width":756,"height":1080},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/617870\/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II__Rise_of_the_Tomb_Kings"}]}
