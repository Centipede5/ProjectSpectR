A boy named Kyle must rescue the princess of a kingdom where very small humans and animals peacefully co-exist. \n \nRipple Island (occasionally seen translated as \"Lipple Island\") is a graphic adventure game where the player interacts with the world using a series of commands, such as \"pick up\", \"walk\" or \"use\". \n \nRather than the usual murder mystery games which were the trend at the time, Ripple Island instead adopts a fantasy storybook setting where smaller humans and friendly animals, such as raccoons and rabbits, co-exist peacefully. The kingdom is threatened by the arrival of Gerogeru, a self-styled Emperor of Darkness and giant frog, after he kidnaps the princess. Kyle, a young boy and the game's protagonist, is attempting to rescue her. \n \nThe game was never released outside of Japan. It was, however, re-released as part of a Japan-only PS2 compilation based on Sunsoft's works. It also received a manga adaptation.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[14605,17469,75586,25130,43130,23175,28277,63734,29646,27266],"tags":[268435487],"category":0,"genres":[31],"first_release_date":572572800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":572572800000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Feb-23","y":1988,"m":2}]}
