MechWarrior was the first video game to offer the player a chance to pilot a BattleMech from the view of a pilot (a MechWarrior). With this game the player has a great deal of freedom when compared to many of the follow-up MechWarrior games, which include choosing missions, buying & selling 'Mechs and parts, hiring lance-mates, and traveling throughout the Inner Sphere. Underneath the major game mechanics, the player had the option of following a role playing style story arc that would unfold over a five-year (game time) period.","storyline":"The story follows a mechwarrior by the name of Gideon Braver Vandenburg. His family has been murdered and the chalice that proves he is heir to the throne of his planet, Ander's Moon, has been stolen. Without the chalice he is exiled. Gideon must develop a force of mechwarriors and battlemechs, find those who committed the acts against his family, and take his revenge within five years or all is lost. \n \nThe story ends with the defeat of the Dark Wing Mercenaries.","collection":144,"franchise":13,"franchises":[13],"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[27314,68287,36950,9789,11253,19301,29173,25311,44076,23212],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435469,536870937,536871079,536871365,536871470,536871487,536871762,536871882,536871906,536872019,536872060,536872179,536874539,536875185,536875309,536875484,536876391,536876857,536877744,536878277,536880072,536882095,536884863,1073741825],"developers":[317],"publishers":[13692,66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[25,167,453,558,575,850,970,994,1107,1148,1267,3627,4273,4397,4572,5479,5945,6832,7365,9160,11183,13951],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,13],"first_release_date":631065600000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[13,121],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":121,"date":710726400000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jul-10","y":1992,"m":7},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Battletech","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Battletech: Ubawareta Seihai"},{"name":"\u673a\u7532\u6218\u58eb","comment":"Chinese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kwzoxmwmjpj2zj3plzbr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kwzoxmwmjpj2zj3plzbr","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vx54atog2lru0fqyu4os.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vx54atog2lru0fqyu4os","width":1680,"height":1050},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yfmlwcl0luz62mx3ykn5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yfmlwcl0luz62mx3ykn5","width":640,"height":400},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pugjp1rkg9e1nebgiixs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pugjp1rkg9e1nebgiixs","width":640,"height":400}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"R3NtRiInFaU"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eogffvdtx0atrprbbpre.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eogffvdtx0atrprbbpre","width":800,"height":1029}}
