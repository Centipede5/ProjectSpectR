An isometric city-building game, it was released on November 30, 1998. \n \nThe most notable difference between this game and its two predecessors is that there are no more roads\u2014all units, including carriers with goods, can walk around freely. This simplifies the building of a settlement, since only the distances between buildings are relevant, and not how roads can be constructed between them. Military units are now directly controlled, making fighting more similar to games like Command & Conquer or Age of Empires, than to the previous Settlers games. \n \nSettlers III was also famous for its peculiar copy protection: in pirated versions of the game, iron smelters would only produce pigs instead of iron, which made weapon production impossible.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"version_parent":3696,"version_title":"Gold Edition","games":[101573,106008,105548,82117,79134,28277,27744,114414,105102,87485],"tags":[268435469],"category":0,"genres":[13],"first_release_date":962409600000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":962409600000,"region":8,"human":"2000-Jul-01","y":2000,"m":7}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ebuvhe2lkasz2xnjckmm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ebuvhe2lkasz2xnjckmm","width":798,"height":948}}
