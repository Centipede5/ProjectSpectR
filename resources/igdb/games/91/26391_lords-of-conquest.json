It proved to be one of EA's best-selling titles of 1986. GameSpy awarded Lords of Conquest a \"Gotcha\" award as one of the top games of its era. \n \nYou and your opponent start by selecting countries in turn from a map. This can be randomly generated based on requested numbers of countries and volumes of water, chosen from one of the 19 predefined ones, or created using the built-in editor. \n \nYour army possesses infantry, cavalry and a water fleet. Natural or produced resources such as gold and iron are identified - countries containing these might be the best ones to invade.You can play at 4 skill levels, and decide how big a factor luck is. With calculations settled by the computer, players can concentrate on the power games.","popularity":16,"games":[23183,55036,32510,11524,26940,7615,36553,6985,35526,23345],"tags":[17,22,268435471,268435472,536874694,536875067,536876237,1073741827],"developers":[11764],"publishers":[1],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[3782,4155,5325],"themes":[17,22],"genres":[15,16],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[63,13,65,75,15],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":599529600000,"region":2,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":567907200000,"region":2,"human":"1987","y":1987,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kziofguekklof4uek4gz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kziofguekklof4uek4gz","width":1000,"height":988}}
