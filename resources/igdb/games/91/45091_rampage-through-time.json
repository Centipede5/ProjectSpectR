To clean up the mess quicker, Scumlabs invent a time machine to send people back in time to fix the mess without having to do it in the present. Unfortunately, the monsters, who have somehow made it back to Earth, appear and run into the machine. They begin terrorizing the past, present, and future, messing up the time stream.","collection":514,"popularity":1,"games":[37088,16468,6985,26391,28380,28010,47823,12632,26848,27209],"tags":[1,17,22,536871082,536872983,536875067,536876927,536880465],"category":0,"keywords":[170,2071,4155,6015,9553],"themes":[1,17,22],"first_release_date":854755200000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":854755200000,"region":8,"human":"1997-Feb-01","y":1997,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/clbizvaj2pied1b5urdp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"clbizvaj2pied1b5urdp","width":496,"height":587}}
