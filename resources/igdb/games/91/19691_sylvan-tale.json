While the player may revisit areas, the game progresses in an essentially linear fashion, as each area can only be accessed if Zetts(the player character) has acquired a specific item or ability from the previous area.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36926,47823,12632,11567,36534,11214,26766,11169,25300,55092],"tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536871139,536871208,536871938,536871939,536872064,536872140,536872419,536872898,536873249,536873671,536873973,536874209,536874706,536875055,536875096,536875280,536875317,536875342,536875397,536875639,536875661,536876205,536876263,536876264,536876374,536876480,536876627,536876764,536878568,536880127,536884345,1073741827],"developers":[9723],"publishers":[9723],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[227,296,1026,1027,1152,1228,1507,1986,2337,2759,3061,3297,3794,4143,4184,4368,4405,4430,4485,4727,4749,5293,5351,5352,5462,5568,5715,5852,7656,9215,13433],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":817344000000,"platforms":[35],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":35,"date":817344000000,"region":5,"human":"1995-Nov-26","y":1995,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pdiyd65tcnec0ibot52n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pdiyd65tcnec0ibot52n","width":554,"height":644}}
