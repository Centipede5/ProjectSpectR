It became such a gambling mania that it was declared illegal under the Republic.\n\nPlaying on the history of the game, there are 6 visually pleasing, rich board designs; Egyptian, Roman, Medieval, Victorian, Modern and Classic.\n\nWe also offer, out of the box, two classic game variations: \u201cOld English\u201d and Nackgammon. \u201cOld English\u201d is the most popular game variation in England.
