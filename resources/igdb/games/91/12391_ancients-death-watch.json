Said dungeon consists of several levels with increasing difficulty and the (relatively) save town above ground in which the characters can shop and heal. \n \nCombat in the game is turn-based. Character improvement uses the traditional experience system, but after a level up the guild in Locklaven has to be visited. The game allows for three races (elf, dwarf and human) and four classes (warrior, thief, mage and priest).","collection":1642,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[16468,13196,5613,19698,49414,28010,36792,23719,25636,22480],"tags":[17,268435468,1073741825],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":757296000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":757296000000,"human":"1993","y":1993,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Ancients 1: Death Watch"},{"name":"Ancients 1"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pwxykxzl3vdzuiuzguek.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pwxykxzl3vdzuiuzguek","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/niyokscnbgeonzf4ssfj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"niyokscnbgeonzf4ssfj","width":320,"height":200}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"pR3ZQwM1Inc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/p1xeuv6xv1bjtczujtma.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p1xeuv6xv1bjtczujtma","width":787,"height":800}}
