The game was originally released in the arcades in 1990 and was subsequently released for the PC Engine\/TurboGrafx-16 (as Aero Blasters) and Sega Mega Drive\/Genesis (as Air Buster in North America) in 1990 and 1991 respectively. \n \nIn Air Buster, the player controls a fighter jet also designed for space travel and shoots enemies, collects power-ups, and defeats bosses to advance levels. As a console game, Air Buster had the distinction of being two player simultaneous, which was rare among side scrolling shooters on home consoles at the time; all games in the Thunder Force, Gradius, and R-Type series were only 1 player on the home consoles.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,36950,27314,64204,28029,10209,26766,25300,11253,71455],"tags":[18,268435461,536871078,536871882,536871971,536874398,536875871,536875934,536875944,536876120,536876296,536876634,1073741828],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[166,970,1059,3486,4959,5022,5032,5208,5384,5722],"themes":[18],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":662601600000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":86,"date":662601600000,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Air Buster","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/l1tulnhvq4omjrlwh0d3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"l1tulnhvq4omjrlwh0d3","width":500,"height":600}}
