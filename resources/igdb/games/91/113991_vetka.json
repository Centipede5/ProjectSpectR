The puzzle task is to connect each burgeon on the grid field to the live branch by adjusting and turning other branches scattered around. There are six levels of difficulty, which differ by size of the puzzle. On the last difficulty level opposite edges of the field are stuck one with another, so the field becomes non-edged (mathematicians would say that the field is a torus).","popularity":1,"games":[95776,80174,19222,101563,87507,107249,90766,10225,88511,106275],"tags":[268435465],"developers":[17565],"publishers":[17565],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":725760000000,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u0412\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xw0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xw0","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xvz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xvz","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5xvy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5xvy","width":320,"height":200}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1iot.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1iot","width":320,"height":200}}
