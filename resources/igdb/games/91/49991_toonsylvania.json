Wanting to test them, he has Phil (a gentle Frankenstein-type monster) put them all on. Unfortunately, the combination of all four inventions causes Phil to explode. You must guide Igor through 15 levels as he searches for all of Phil's parts, as well as all four of his inventions to complete the quest. However, getting through the levels is no walk in the park, as enemies lurk behind every corner. Fortunately, there are plenty of weapons to collect and throw at them. Will Igor be able to restore Phil before the mad scientist comes home?
