The game is also a spin-off of the Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA series of Vocaloid rhythm games. Like the original, the game primarily makes use of Vocaloids, a series of singing synthesizer software and the songs created using these vocaloids most notably the virtual-diva Vocaloid Hatsune Miku. While Project Mirai only had button controls, Project Mirai 2 adds use of touch screen controls where players tap the bottom screen. An increased sense of speed and additional gimmicks have also been added.","collection":1292,"franchise":545,"franchises":[545,544],"rating":87,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":78.8571428571429,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":82.92857142857144,"total_rating_count":12,"rating_count":3,"games":[11711,76219,11767,44154,36660,36692,12875,28192,9626,12078],"tags":[268435463,536870990,536871080,536871081,536871186,536871363,536872594,536872804,536872964,536875049,536876869,536876870,536880433,1073741826],"developers":[112],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,168,169,274,451,1682,1892,2052,4137,5957,5958,9521],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1432771200000,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1432771200000,"region":5,"human":"2015-May-28","y":2015,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1441929600000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Sep-11","y":2015,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1441670400000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Sep-08","y":2015,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Hatsune Miku: Project Mirai 2","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u521d\u97f3\u30df\u30af Project Mirai 2","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yqxq8c6hsfzh8anoigcv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yqxq8c6hsfzh8anoigcv","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t0i456jlgdwgngnegcvs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t0i456jlgdwgngnegcvs","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zpf9iwd5mguwvxyvokho.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zpf9iwd5mguwvxyvokho","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/psq7i6t2yqnjkkf2ghvy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"psq7i6t2yqnjkkf2ghvy","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/slscfk3ovdxjpppibuxp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"slscfk3ovdxjpppibuxp","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mxtxq9ebvxurn7j6zjof.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mxtxq9ebvxurn7j6zjof","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mcgjqo9exzzxvgzv81q4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mcgjqo9exzzxvgzv81q4","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ohemedqyxwy1saw1qyhw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ohemedqyxwy1saw1qyhw","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/daksax3ca5oqzlflobko.jpg","cloudinary_id":"daksax3ca5oqzlflobko","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jtjq94uzmfzbvlttzlsx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jtjq94uzmfzbvlttzlsx","width":400,"height":512},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/agx8xwydeseegm6mwai9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"agx8xwydeseegm6mwai9","width":833,"height":1000},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yiwnknycsw05j4eosaoz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yiwnknycsw05j4eosaoz","width":833,"height":1000}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fuewbximtp6itun5tyx7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fuewbximtp6itun5tyx7","width":640,"height":584},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a music-rhythm game in which players tap buttons in time with anime-style music videos.
