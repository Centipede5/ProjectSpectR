{"id":12191,"name":"Operation Thunderbolt","slug":"operation-thunderbolt","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/operation-thunderbolt","created_at":1441216636629,"updated_at":1515631474155,"summary":"Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride. \n \nThere are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.","collection":2914,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28751,7843,18088,27314,54539,10039,17446,36594,28029,76229],"tags":[1,39,268435461,268435489,536870913,536870918,536871642,536871969,536871971,536872696,536873064,536875075,536875171,536875242,536875558,536875870,536877281,536880637,1073741825],"developers":[1440],"publishers":[1271,1440],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[1,6,730,1057,1059,1784,2152,4163,4259,4330,4646,4958,6369,9725],"themes":[1,39],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[52,63,16,15,26,19,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":780969600000,"region":2,"human":"1994-Oct-01","y":1994,"m":10},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":662601600000,"region":2,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":662601600000,"region":1,"human":"1990","y":1990,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/apcxdqylg8mkht6c99eb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"apcxdqylg8mkht6c99eb","width":640,"height":777}}
