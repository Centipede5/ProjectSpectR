If needed, the player can refuel, buy water or whatever else is required from the powerboats in Europe or the tankers in Africa. Prices of these essential materials aren't always very reasonable, given the player's meagre starting wallet, motivating players to earn higher sponsorships through strong performance in the race.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[103018,109292,27378,90688,107196,107215,81548,104983,55192,584],"tags":[268435466,1073741827],"publishers":[17019],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":599529600000,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5r28.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5r28","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5r27.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5r27","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5r26.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5r26","width":320,"height":200}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hyn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hyn","width":320,"height":200}}
