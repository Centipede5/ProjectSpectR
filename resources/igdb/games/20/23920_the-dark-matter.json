We totally ripped off the coin-up mood we were living in during early '90s, and transformed in something we love nowdays, with modern mechanics. \nWe decided to manitain an oldschool visuals and audio, that's why we choose to go with LowPoly visuals and Chiptune genere for the SFX and Music: all the Audio was recorded by Victor Love, and now he's in the team, believing in the project.\n\nNow The Dark Matter has more than 30 playable characters, an endless world divided in around 20 blocks before the random generation, 35+ achievements and 7 leaderboards. We're really proud of the game, and we're gonna release in September for IOs.\n\nThe point of The Dark Matter is being casual, but hardcore and cool. A game you can play for 3 minutes or for 6 hours, and will be always rewarding and immersive.\n\nA word about ads: we decided to remove all the ADV and maintain ONLY REWARDED ADS. We believe players are the most important focus for a Developer, so we want to respect players at max: no ads, you choose if watch the ad for a reward.
