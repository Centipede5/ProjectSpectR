A group of evil eyes have stolen parts of the Sunheart, and the player needs to recover them. \n \nBouken Danshaku Don: The Lost Sunheart (\"Adventures of Don Baron: The Lost Sunheart\", roughly) is a horizontal shoot 'em up exclusive to the PC Engine. The game's plot concerns the titular Sunheart device, which is broken into several pieces and spirited away by a group of malicious eyeball enemies. The hero, in a series of vehicles, takes down each of the boss creatures that are protecting a piece of the stolen Sunheart. \n \nThe game is distinct among shoot 'em ups for allowing players to keep their power-ups after dying. This does not mitigate the game's difficulty, as it has some very strict checkpointing and many enemies with difficult-to-avoid homing shots. The game's surreal sense of humor comes through with its bizarre bosses, in some way invoking the flamboyant Cho Aniki series.","popularity":1,"games":[68287,71455,36950,25300,28029,64204,27314,25311,19448,26766],"tags":[1,18,536871078,536871882,536871971],"category":0,"keywords":[166,970,1059],"themes":[1,18],"first_release_date":694483200000,"platforms":[86],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":694483200000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jan-04","y":1992,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":697161600000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Feb-04","y":1992,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Bouken Danshaku Don Sun=Heart Hen","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/aowz6dyhghhfok8gjnhj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aowz6dyhghhfok8gjnhj","width":1427,"height":1431}}
