It is considered to be one of the worst sequels of all time. \n \nPlay is similar to the original Spy Hunter but takes place in a 3D overhead behind the car view. The player can obtain several weapons just like in the original Spy hunter such as oil slicks, missiles and smoke screen. The game also includes a two player co-operative mode where the players can help each other out. The arcade cabinet uses a single monitor divided by a bezel and two steering wheels.[2] Both the cabinet and in-game design were previously seen in Bally Midway's Max RPM, released the year before.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"keywords":[1094]}
