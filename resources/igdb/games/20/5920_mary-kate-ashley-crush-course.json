{"id":5920,"name":"Mary-Kate & Ashley: Crush Course","slug":"mary-kate-ashley-crush-course","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/mary-kate-ashley-crush-course","created_at":1396667271118,"updated_at":1515772740446,"summary":"Some totally cute boys have invited Mary-Kate and Ashley to a beach party but the directions have met a terrible fate! Someone has torn up the map that the twins were going to use to get to the shindig, and now they must pool their resources and find all of the pieces before the party starts without them. Some of the map is split up between the classrooms at school, some of them are in the hands of some weird girl that won't give them back, and others have completely disappeared. There are tons of mini-games to keep young gamers busy here, including a mini-golf outing, a cheerleading challenge, and many others. One of the game's best features is a creative music-making program that allows kids to punch in their own cool beats and tunes. You'll start out the game in the freshman class, but piecing together the map and completing a few of the side games will earn you a pass to the higher grades. Get good marks and chase after good-looking boys in this fabulous adventure.","collection":3443,"franchise":382,"franchises":[382],"popularity":1,"games":[23175,59516,13189,55289,37022,27314,25222,25646,25311,41895],"tags":[1,268435487,536871939,536875054,536875395,536875590,1073741826],"developers":[319],"publishers":[287],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[1027,4142,4483,4678],"themes":[1],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":1004572800000,"platforms":[6,22,7],"release_dates":[{"category":1,"platform":7,"date":1004572800000,"human":"2001-Nov","y":2001,"m":11},{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":1004572800000,"human":"2001-Nov","y":2001,"m":11},{"category":1,"platform":22,"date":1004572800000,"human":"2001-Nov","y":2001,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/frk9doyofo3mxzt59v41.jpg","cloudinary_id":"frk9doyofo3mxzt59v41","width":300,"height":298},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
