The line of golf games was a flagship brand for Access, and the series spanned several years: from 1990 to 2003. Several versions of the game and expansion packs (containing new courses[1] and golfers[2] mainly) were created for the Mac and PC over the years. A version for the Xbox named Links 2004 was released in November 2003. In 1991, Links won Computer Gaming World's 1991 Action Game of the Year award.[3] \n \nIn 2004, Microsoft sold the Salt Lake City studio to Take-Two Interactive, where it was renamed Indie Built. Indie Built was subsequently shut down in 2006. It is therefore unlikely that Take-Two will produce any additional versions of Links.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14]}
