These robots are built in factories that assign the robot a name in addition to installing its head, body, shoulder, and feet. The player has a pre-game lobby to get ready for the robot combat action. All matches have rounds of 60 seconds (unlike the 99-second round of most modern fighting video games). Both robots have a separate gauge for energy and damage. Standard punches and kicks can be thrown in addition to special moves (which look like ammunition).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,34919,40524,23175,16468,1070,2940,68324,28029,37022],"tags":[1,536871079],"category":0,"keywords":[167],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":755740800000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":755740800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Dec-13","y":1993,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vlux3kieevs6eods9e5p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vlux3kieevs6eods9e5p","width":255,"height":394}}
