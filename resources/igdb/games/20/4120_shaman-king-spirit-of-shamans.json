{"id":4120,"name":"Shaman King : Spirit of Shamans","slug":"shaman-king-spirit-of-shamans","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/shaman-king-spirit-of-shamans","created_at":1390545853830,"updated_at":1531310365851,"summary":"Shaman King: Spirit of Shamans is based on the anime, in which you will complete the first half of the overall story featured within the anime\/manga series. This is the first fighting game featured within the series. The graphics seem to reflect other styles seen within the original Gundam Battle Assault, in which you will be playing right-to-left with advanced sprite graphics. Your spirit can also be regularly used within this fighter as to assist you. At random times in battle, the icon of your specific spirit will flash, in which if you press either O or X fast enough, your overall spirit meter will rise. When risen to the highest extent, you can unleash your ultimate. Within this game, three different buttons vary from a weak attack, or a more stronger attack. The combo system seems to range up to the max of 10 in battle. Story mode, Vs mode, and Arcade mode are the three playable modes within this game. In Story mode, you will experience various cutscenes and additional minigames. Arcade mode seems to be the same except for the fact that you will be continuously battling. Of course within Vs mode, you can battle against a friend or a com. Overall within this game, 17 characters are playable (3 of which being different versions of Yoh). It is known that Hao can also be playable, but a Gameshark code is needed. Fortunately, as well within battle, character voices will be experienced rather commonly, in which anime cutscenes will be experienced at times - such as in the intro. Overall, it seems that Shaman King: Spirit of Shamans is the best 2D fighter of its series.","collection":4524,"franchise":240,"franchises":[240],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[24426,17548,51464,25222,19333,26223,28175,78149,51448,27092],"tags":[1,27,268435460,268435465,268435487,536870973,536870990,536871019,536871139,536871208,536871262,536871308,536871549,536871939,536873473,536873787,536875053,536875054,536875055,536875678,536875742,536876847,536877783,536887631,1073741828],"developers":[396],"publishers":[617],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[61,78,107,227,296,350,396,637,1027,2561,2875,4141,4142,4143,4766,4830,5935,6871,16719],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[4,9,31],"first_release_date":1023321600000,"platforms":[7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":1023321600000,"human":"2002-Jun-06","y":2002,"m":6}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/myvpmxoluh8ol7hx3qol.jpg","cloudinary_id":"myvpmxoluh8ol7hx3qol","width":256,"height":254},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.bandaigames.channel.or.jp\/list\/shamanking\/"}]}
