Stone crumbles, metal rusts, people grow old and die. All things end in dust, crushed fine by the turning of the ages. The lone weapon against such an inexorable force is constant vigilance. \n \nBut even that can only hope to stave off the inevitable for a while longer. \n \nAmidst countless generations of unbound war and reckless destruction, peace had always been a distant dream. Twenty years ago, that dream was violently realized when the Traitor King Weyrin unleashed his curse upon the land. In a matter of weeks, the entire kingdom of Galamonde fell under its shadow. \n \nThe remaining great nations of Valessia, Ondora, and Zaragos managed to broker a truce quickly enough to hold the curse at bay, but the land it blighted endures, a festering threat in the heart of the world. \n \nIn the ensuing decades, what was once open warfare has devolved into restrained hostility, as the powers that be struggle to hold themselves together under constant threat of outbreak, uprising, and the inevitable resurgence of total war.\"","hypes":1,"popularity":5.333333333333333,"games":[22387,75848,26845,26163,103303,13196,25921,47823,13623,109581],"tags":[17,39,268435468,268435480,268435488,536871094,536871422,536871433,536871595,536872264,536873311,536873364,1073741827],"developers":[11407],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[182,510,521,683,1352,2399,2452],"themes":[17,39],"genres":[12,24,32],"first_release_date":1546214400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":3,"date":1546214400000,"region":2,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":1546214400000,"region":2,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1546214400000,"region":2,"human":"2018","y":2018,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/m2emv5abnetly6ftdmun.jpg","cloudinary_id":"m2emv5abnetly6ftdmun","width":1251,"height":704},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/q8uhpvmnn6cycf9wtroe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q8uhpvmnn6cycf9wtroe","width":1251,"height":704},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fqdsvhdsdf9ux1rtkeks.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fqdsvhdsdf9ux1rtkeks","width":1251,"height":704},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/prnurjuwfywu7k35pceg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"prnurjuwfywu7k35pceg","width":1251,"height":704}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"cSbSyP1d4y0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/la4zlq1jcikicncdfmog.jpg","cloudinary_id":"la4zlq1jcikicncdfmog","width":720,"height":432},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.chronicleofruin.com\/"},{"category":5,"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/RuinousA"}]}
