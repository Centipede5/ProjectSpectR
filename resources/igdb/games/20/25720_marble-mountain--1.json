Balance, roll and puzzle your way through increasingly difficult levels on your way to the top of the mountain. \n\nMost Marble\u2019s spend their days drunkenly smashing into each other or hide in constant fear that the finger of god will come along and flick them. However once in a great while there comes a Marble who is brave enough to leave town and seek glory by traversing to the top of the Mountain and seek the treasure every Marble knows to be there! \n\n\n\nAn Epic Journey - balance at precarious heights and navigate treacherous environments on your quest to the top of the mountain to return the stolen treasures from the temple \nTricks, Traps and Treasure - dodge deadly Mettalan cubes, solve puzzles and collect all the gold aurums you can find! \nAmazing Handcrafted Levels - traverse increasingly difficult levels with rolling green hills, spooky graveyards, ancient temples, unforgiving volcanoes, dry deserts, sky-high mountain tops, snow-capped summits and dangerous cliffs \nThrilling Adventure - avoid massive boulders, flee oncoming avalanches, and tumble down titanic waterfalls \nPlay it your way - take it slow, enjoy the sceney, and explore every optional path. Or speed run every level and compete in the global leaderboards \nCollect them all - new Marble skins can be unlocked in every level as well as a variety of nifty hats. Are you up to the challenge? \nImmerse yourself - put on your Oculus Rift or HTC Vive headset and enjoy the third person perspective. Peek around the corner, survey the panoramic levels, or push your boundaries and look straight down into the foggy depths of the mountain (please note the game play experience is not compromised for non-VR gamers)","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[51485,55289,26848,37022,25646,10039,25311,24199,34919,55752],"tags":[1,268435464,268435487,268435488,268435489,536875351,1073741826,1073741831],"developers":[11505],"publishers":[11505],"game_engines":[13],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,7],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[4439],"themes":[1],"genres":[8,31,32,33],"first_release_date":1459728000000,"platforms":[14,13,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":13,"date":1459814400000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-05","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1459728000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-04","y":2016,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1459728000000,"region":8,"human":"2016-Apr-04","y":2016,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/opuzh8d5bwp59jslfq83.jpg","cloudinary_id":"opuzh8d5bwp59jslfq83","width":1900,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pgc2hpyjcwxslpyh9j2y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pgc2hpyjcwxslpyh9j2y","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/g6oogd9f1azojjyspu0w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g6oogd9f1azojjyspu0w","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jqglrsxcsppqtknjyy3y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jqglrsxcsppqtknjyy3y","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ic21pv2th3yxswhibibc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ic21pv2th3yxswhibibc","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"8x_iCDFmU8A"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"UIMYHJ8kG8A"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/eplk2ibkhbwemgopa5rd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eplk2ibkhbwemgopa5rd","width":957,"height":151},"esrb":{"rating":1},"pegi":{"rating":1},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.lightningrock.com\/marble-mountain"}]}
