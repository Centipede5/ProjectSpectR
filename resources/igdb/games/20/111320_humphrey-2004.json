You simply step on a tile to paint it, but you must be careful not to fall in holes, get electrocuted when stepping on electric tiles, or killed by various enemies. While you cannot attack, you can jump over long distances and change directions in mid-air. There are also special tiles you can step on to help make your job easier. These include the \"off\" switch for electric tiles, mobile platforms that can move you across vast distances, bombs that kill everything in sight, teleport tiles, and many more. There are also the usual power-up tiles such as health, extra life, and extra points.","popularity":1,"games":[107226,95776,80174,19222,101563,87507,107249,90766,10225,88511],"tags":[268435465],"developers":[16800],"publishers":[16800],"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1104451200000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":1104451200000,"human":"2004","y":2004,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5j79.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5j79","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sc5j78.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sc5j78","width":640,"height":480}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1h9m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1h9m","width":640,"height":480}}
