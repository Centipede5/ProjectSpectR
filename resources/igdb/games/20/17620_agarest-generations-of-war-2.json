Players explore towns, travel along map points, and fight humans and creatures in turn-based combat. Action sequences consist of selecting weapons and attacks (Ice Vein, Trick Hit, Rushing Jaeger, Drop Dead, etc.) from a menu screen; damage is indicated by slashing sounds, light effects, and floating hit points above characters' heads. The game depicts several female characters whose breasts\/buttocks are partially obscured by hot-spring mist and soap suds. During some bathhouse sequences, players can engage in massage-based mini-games, applying oil or foodstuffs (e.g., bananas, mushrooms, popsicles) to the bodies of bikini-clad women. One related achievement is called Ecstasy Time. Other still-frame images depict female characters in provocative poses (e.g., women hiding behind bed sheets; two characters eating a banana together) or engaging in suggestive dialogue: \u201cBigger is better, right?\u201d The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"Mainly a story \/ dialogue based game.
