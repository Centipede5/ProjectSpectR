Battles are depicted from an overhead perspective, with characters moving around a grid while taking turns selecting attack moves from a menu. Attacks are presented in short animated sequences: characters striking each other with swords, lances, axes, and pistols. Cutscenes also depict violent acts: characters stabbing themselves or sacrificing themselves for others (e.g., jumping in the way of an attack). A handful of scenes depict silhouetted splashes of blood or brief mist-like sprays when characters are struck. A handful of female characters are depicted wearing low-cut outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage; in one cutscene, the camera (from a first-person perspective) zooms-in on a female character's cleavage.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Sexual images and\/or sexual innuendo - Mild bad language - Violence causing minor injury only","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire_Emblem_Fates"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/fireemblem.wikia.com\/wiki\/Fire_Emblem_Fates"}]}
