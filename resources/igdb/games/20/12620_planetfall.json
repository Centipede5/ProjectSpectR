Like most Infocom games, thanks to the portable Z-machine, it was released for several platforms simultaneously. The original release included versions for the PC (both as a booter and for DOS) and Apple II. The Atari ST and Commodore 64 versions were released in 1985. A version for CP\/M was also released. Although Planetfall was Meretzky's first title, it proved one of his most popular works and a best-seller for Infocom; it was one of five top-selling titles to be re-released in Solid Gold versions including in-game hints. Planetfall utilizes the Z-machine originally developed for the Zork franchise and was added as a bonus to the \"Zork Anthology\". \n \nThe word planetfall is a portmanteau of planet and landfall, and occasionally used in science fiction to that effect. The book Planetfall written by Arthur Byron Cover, uses the game image on the cover, and is marketed \"In the bestselling tradition of THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY.[2] A sequel, Stationfall, was released in 1987. \n \nPlanetfall teleports you 12,000 years into an outrageous future. You joined the Stellar Patrol to explore the galaxy, but all you've seen is the end of a mop - until your ship explodes and you're jettisoned onto a mysterious, deserted planet. Luckily, you have Floyd, a lovable multi-purpose robot with the personality of a mischievous 8-year-old. He's the ideal companion with whom to brave your new world, as you dare its dangers and uncover its secrets.","collection":1855,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[26766,25300,36950,27314,19448,19301,25311,8773,76098,68287],"tags":[18,27,268435487,536871130,536871262,536871882,536873308,536875172,536875531,536876604,536878561,536885978,536886008,1073741829],"developers":[368],"publishers":[368,1798],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[218,350,970,2396,4260,4619,5692,7649,15066,15096],"themes":[18,27],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":441676800000,"platforms":[63,93,14,155,13,65,16,75,126,149,15,25,94,154,151],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":151,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":155,"date":504835200000,"region":1,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":154,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":149,"date":699235200000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Feb-28","y":1992,"m":2},{"category":2,"platform":94,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":504835200000,"region":2,"human":"1985","y":1985,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":93,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":473299200000,"region":2,"human":"1984","y":1984,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":126,"date":441676800000,"region":2,"human":"1983","y":1983,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/begunilpvxpq24esekno.jpg","cloudinary_id":"begunilpvxpq24esekno","width":700,"height":849}}
