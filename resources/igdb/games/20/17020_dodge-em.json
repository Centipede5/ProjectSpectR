The player controls one car and has to drive counter-clockwise, avoiding computer-controlled cars whose sole aim is to produce a head-on collision. The player's car can travel at two speeds, a 'normal' speed which is the same speed as computer-controlled cars, or if the player presses the controller button, his or her car travels at a 'fast' speed double its normal speed. The computer-controlled cars have only one speed. Players change lanes by pushing the controller in the appropriate direction when their car is near one of the gaps in the roadway.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,40470,36608,34919,55192,36662,16468,23175,40524,78315],"tags":[1,268435466,536875069,536876727,1073741827],"developers":[2406],"publishers":[2406],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[4157,5815],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":347068800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":347068800000,"region":2,"human":"1980","y":1980,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w4olfurpddhbvqwe3ilw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w4olfurpddhbvqwe3ilw","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"VR","video_id":"d1edvROHa8k"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ihk7tsrtmqkozgofxnox.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ihk7tsrtmqkozgofxnox","width":600,"height":823}}
