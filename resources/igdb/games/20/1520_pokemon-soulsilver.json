During battle, players select attacks from a series of menus then watch as the attacks are performed on screen. Some of the projectile attacks\/weapons include a \"cartoony\" flamethrower, poison sting dart, egg bomb, and \"zap cannon\" (mounted on a  Pok\u00e9mon's  back). Damage is somewhat minimal: the majority of attacks involve smacking sounds, the depletion of health meters, and blinking effects; a handful of attacks result in small fiery explosions, light bursts, and screen-shaking effects. One storyline describes how rivals have stolen \"Slowpoke\"  Pok\u00e9mon  and cut off their tails to sell in the underground market; players sometimes encounter these tailless creatures in the town of Azalea.","rating":3},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":1},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.pokemongoldsilver.com\/us\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver"}]}
