In the middle of the game, when the number of known girls was high, these \"bombs\" became the primary concern of the player, forcing careful planning and strategies like round-robin dating. Although the feature was still present in the later games, it was considerably reduced in importance and the difficulty in avoiding it.","popularity":1,"games":[11362,73075,9760,33603,36962,55888,65827,2015,32283,33383],"tags":[268435471],"category":0,"genres":[15],"first_release_date":826329600000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":826329600000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Mar-09","y":1996,"m":3}]}
