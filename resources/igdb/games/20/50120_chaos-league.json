It was released in Europe on 8 August 2004 and later in North America on 8 March 2005. The game is a spin on American football, the violence of the Medieval football with no rules and rugby-style of sports yet set in a fantasy world with teams being made up of fantasy races such as dwarves, elves, orcs and undead, along with the use of magic and other fictional elements during a \"match\". The tone of the game is satirical with comedic color commentary and adverts for fictional in-game universe products. An official expansion was later released in 2005 bundled with the original, titled Chaos League: Sudden Death that added new features and gameplay tweaks. \n \nWhile not a direct video game adaption, Chaos League bears resemblance to Games Workshop's Blood Bowl tabletop board game, which is also about fantasy sports. Cyanide Studios would later develop the video game version of Blood Bowl in 2009, which itself utilizes certain features from Chaos League.","hypes":2,"popularity":4,"games":[14394,27092,15851,36553,35371,23345,34155,55036,2933,26940],"tags":[1,22,27,268435470,268435471,536870938,536870939,536871008,536871063,536871208,536871262,536871938,536872078,536872232,536872978,536874694,536875074,536875265,536875316,536876235,536877040,536877686,536878073,536878352,536880933,536884022],"category":0,"keywords":[26,27,96,151,296,350,1026,1166,1320,2066,3782,4162,4353,4404,5323,6128,6774,7161,7440,10021,13110],"themes":[1,22,27],"genres":[14,15],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1isg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1isg","width":353,"height":500}}
