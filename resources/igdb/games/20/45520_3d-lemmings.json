The only introduction is a movie. It shows a completely flat (2D) lemming popping out of a computer's floppy drive, and finding a \"3D\" button to press, which makes him 3-dimensional. After that, the PC blows up and the (now 3D) lemmings inside it escape. Other movies play after completing each set of 20 levels, but are not connected by a storyline.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[9],"first_release_date":823132800000,"platforms":[32],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":32,"date":823132800000,"region":8,"human":"1996-Feb-01","y":1996,"m":2}]}
