It also has a two-player co-op mode. Players shoot with 3 different weapons and have lots of different power-ups to help fight off the Huggables. It is only available on the iPad, thought to be caused by the fact the game was too small for an iPhone\/iPod Touch screen.","collection":3608,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/v02ob2exiv26jr0cji2y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"v02ob2exiv26jr0cji2y","width":480,"height":360}}
