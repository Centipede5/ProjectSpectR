What makes this system different from ATB is that actions take different amounts of time based on the weapon or ability used, for example an axe will need more time than a dagger to attack. \n \nThe game features a vast world to explore; there are several towns and a variety of monsters to combat. The game also features multi-player experience after unlocking the second character in the story.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[34155,35130,29348,54775,59427,18398,26951,28309,32195,28182],"tags":[22,268435468,536871063,536871208,536871938],"developers":[1046],"publishers":[7041],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[151,296,1026],"themes":[22],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1007510400000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1007510400000,"human":"2001-Dec-05","y":2001,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iw5rgk30bralrsxshjeq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iw5rgk30bralrsxshjeq","width":640,"height":908}}
