This coin-op conversion offers different rounds of side-scrolling beat-em-up gameplay, each with an end boss. DJ Boy is able to punch, kick, combine them in a flying attack and punch to both sides at the same time by pressing the main attack buttons. Although the visuals are less rough and friendlier than its contemporary counterparts, the difficulty is very unforgiving. DJ Boy has only four life bars and when they are gone, the game is over without continues. Defeated enemies leave behind coins. At the end of each stage the coins can be exchanged for a skateboard, a stronger punch or other items.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":633830400000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":633830400000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Feb-01","y":1990,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uqz3dnv42lm0zzgcfhuw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uqz3dnv42lm0zzgcfhuw","width":1447,"height":2031}}
