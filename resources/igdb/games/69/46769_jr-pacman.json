The player can eat an energizer to turn the ghosts blue, making them vulnerable for a short period of time, and allowing the player to eat them for extra points. Once the maze is cleared, a new maze will be presented and the gameplay will continue.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}]}
