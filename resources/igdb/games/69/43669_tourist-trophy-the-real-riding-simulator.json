Custom rider option let you choose how your character looks and handles a bike, while a quick-play \"Arcade\" mode lets you pick a race and go. Play a one-on-one race, a time trial, or a regular race that allows you to race using modified bikes. \n \n\"Tourist Trophy\" mode challenges you to a variety of races, but before you hit the pavement, you'll have to earn a license. There are four license levels that you can earn: Novice, Junior, Expert, and Super. New motorcycles and equipment become available with each new level. Once a license has been secured, move onto \"Challenge\" mode and earn a bike by competing in race events that also open up extra bikes and gear as rewards.","popularity":1,"games":[23314,18699,76259,103018,101535,101205,101142,101087,100902,100844],"tags":[268435466],"category":0,"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1146700800000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1146700800000,"region":8,"human":"2006-May-04","y":2006,"m":5}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ebrfhqatnpslw1e72q6n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ebrfhqatnpslw1e72q6n","width":1504,"height":2141}}
