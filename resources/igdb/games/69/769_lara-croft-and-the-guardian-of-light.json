Unlike previous games in the series, the game does not carry the Tomb Raider brand and has a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay. In multiplayer, players take the role as either Lara Croft or a 2,000-year-old Mayan warrior named Totec. They must work together in order to stop the evil spirit Xolotl and retrieve the Mirror of Smoke. A single-player campaign mode is available that does not include the non-playable character AI following or helping Lara.","collection":183,"rating":74.94807174253489,"popularity":3,"aggregated_rating":78.875,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":76.91153587126745,"total_rating_count":46,"rating_count":36,"games":[37777,7325,25076,8263,1163,7344,26855,24426,512,7331],"tags":[1,17,22,268435461,268435464,268435465,268435487,536870958,536871874,536871945,536872245,536872535,536872594,536873066,536873473,536874398,536874916,536875047,536875057,536875062,536875067,536875097,536875147,536875157,536875195,536875209,536875258,536875281,536875293,536875358,536875453,536875572,536875610,536875638,536875815,536875830,536875937,536876085,536876205,536876220,536876223,536876303,536876435,536876476,536876528,536876726,536877429,536877628,536878241,536879731,536880633,536882120,536882736,536883336,536883374,536883642,536883760,536892885,1073741827],"developers":[552,291],"publishers":[26],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[46,962,1033,1333,1623,1682,2154,2561,3486,4004,4135,4145,4150,4155,4185,4235,4245,4283,4297,4346,4369,4381,4446,4541,4660,4698,4726,4903,4918,5025,5173,5293,5308,5311,5391,5523,5564,5616,5814,6517,6716,7329,8819,9721,11208,11824,12424,12462,12730,12848,21973],"themes":[1,17,22],"genres":[5,8,9,31],"first_release_date":1282089600000,"platforms":[45,6,36,9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1285632000000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Sep-28","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1285718400000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Sep-29","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1285632000000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Sep-28","y":2010,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1282089600000,"human":"2010-Aug-18","y":2010,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1282089600000,"human":"2010-Aug-18","y":2010,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":36,"date":1282089600000,"human":"2010-Aug-18","y":2010,"m":8}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jwvk3gd5mjp25bla3ncn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jwvk3gd5mjp25bla3ncn","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cmfj3ub8sahmdit5kygf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cmfj3ub8sahmdit5kygf","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ggkkaujsbzjeiww2gahu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ggkkaujsbzjeiww2gahu","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u7rauvjusvpza8ofbl6c.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u7rauvjusvpza8ofbl6c","width":1920,"height":1200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/c9yp1diojpk99xrqd6bq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"c9yp1diojpk99xrqd6bq","width":1920,"height":1200}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Wxtjg52-0pc"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iihfpq0dingitc4xqctg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iihfpq0dingitc4xqctg","width":453,"height":602},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Lara Croft on a quest to recover an ancient artifact. Using a top-down view, players must cooperatively solve environmental puzzles to avoid traps as they traverse ancient temples and jungle ruins. Players use spears, machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, and remote bombs to defeat a villain's demonic forces. Shooting enemy creatures (e.g., giant spiders, stone creatures, giant lizards, dinosaurs) sometimes results in splashes of colored blood that briefly stain the ground. Realistic gunfire, explosions, and cries of pain are heard throughout the frenetic combat.
