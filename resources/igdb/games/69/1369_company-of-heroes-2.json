From a top-down perspective, players can position troops, employ military tactics, and complete campaigns against opposing forces. Soldiers use machine guns, grenades, flamethrowers and other weapons to kill enemies, who react by screaming in pain and emitting small splashes\/puffs of blood. Some battlefield sequences depict explosions that cause small bodies to flail, sometimes resulting in soldiers' dismemberment. Cutscenes depict more dramatic (and close-up) instances of violence, such as a commander executing an unarmed soldier. The words \u201cf**k\u201d and \u201csh*t\u201d can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"external":{"steam":"231430"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
