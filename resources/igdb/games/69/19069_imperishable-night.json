{"id":19069,"name":"Imperishable Night","slug":"imperishable-night","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/imperishable-night","created_at":1462640983156,"updated_at":1517270929079,"summary":"Imperishable Night features a total of eight playable characters, in pre-set pairs (and later, individually). The pairs work in tandem: one person fires when unfocused, while the other pops in and fires when focused, with a reduction in movement speed. The two attacks can be drastically different. The individual characters do not have an attack change when focused, with the exception of Remilia.\n\nQuite a few smaller details are unique to this game, including Last Spells - for an enemy, a Last Spell is a bonus Spell Card which the player can tackle without fear of losing lives\/bombs. On the player side, Last Spells are secondary \"bomb\" Spell Cards, which last longer\/do much more damage at the expense of two bomb stocks. There is a gauge which tracks how human\/youkai (normal\/focused) you are, as well as a new \"Time\" system, which affects gameplay.","storyline":"It's the eve of the Harvest Moon Festival in Gensokyo when youkai sense that something is wrong with the moon. It appears that the moon has been replaced by a fake moon. The main characters stop time and head off to find the culprit to try and ensure a full moon for the festival. Their journey leads them into the Bamboo Forest of the Lost and finally to Eientei, inhabited by beings from the Moon itself.","rating":80,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":80,"total_rating_count":3,"rating_count":3,"games":[76065,16468,26453,26305,24637,14617,12535,6054,13196,76079],"tags":[17,268435489,1073741827],"developers":[9378],"publishers":[9378],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"themes":[17],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":1092528000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1092528000000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Aug-15","y":2004,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Touhou Eiyashou","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"\u6771\u65b9\u6c38\u591c\u6284\u3000\uff5e Imperishable Night","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dqalg4vxcxw4vksj9lir.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dqalg4vxcxw4vksj9lir","width":640,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ivvnse2bcft2l4qnz0lo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ivvnse2bcft2l4qnz0lo","width":300,"height":225},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mflmvlfgdwv1inia8wwl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mflmvlfgdwv1inia8wwl","width":1600,"height":900}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"tLXvt-a6hXE"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/opd6uipqopa5dz6ek09b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"opd6uipqopa5dz6ek09b","width":1641,"height":1626},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/touhou.wikia.com\/wiki\/Imperishable_Night"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Imperishable_Night"}]}
