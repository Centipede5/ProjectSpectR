As players explore dungeon-like areas, they engage in turn-based battle against goddesses and other enemies (e.g., crabs, ghosts, frogs). Characters use swords, axes, and lances to deplete enemies' hit points. Combat is highlighted by impact sounds and cries of pain. Some characters wear outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage and buttocks, (e.g., a bath sequence depicts characters whose breasts are barely covered by steam). Camera angles sometimes focus on female characters' underwear and chests. The dialogue also includes some suggestive material: \u201cEven if you get groped a bit\u2026you're tough enough to get over it!\u201d and \u201c[W]e're here making boob jokes.\u201d The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201cb*tch\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Mild bad language","rating":3},"external":{"steam":"353270"}}
