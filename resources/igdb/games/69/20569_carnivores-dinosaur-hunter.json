As a result, these are no \"pea-brained\" dinosaurs -- these are dangerous creatures that are able to see, hear and sense the hunter. If you're not careful, it's very easy for the hunter to become the hunted. \n \nWith a series of different dinosaurs across varied, distinct environments (including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills,) how you approach your target is important. Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey.","collection":1574,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":60,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":60,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[11423,13189,27314,29173,25222,25311,22425,41895,55036,55803],"tags":[34,268435461,268435471,268435487,536870999,536871446,536871939,536874694],"publishers":[4753],"category":0,"keywords":[87,534,1027,3782],"themes":[34],"genres":[5,15,31],"first_release_date":1281484800000,"platforms":[45,38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1281484800000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Aug-11","y":2010,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1284681600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Sep-17","y":2010,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/annyrwso5hyr94jgjbpj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"annyrwso5hyr94jgjbpj","width":700,"height":466}]}
