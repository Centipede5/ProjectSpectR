Players use realistic shotguns, machine guns, and grenades to kill adversaries in frequent gun fights. Successful hits result in large spurts of blood that sometimes splash on the camera. The game allows players to shoot or run over civilians, who cry out in pain when attacked. Enforcer characters can arrest criminals, and are able to execute them after cuffing their hands. Some missions involve transporting packets of drugs to a particular location; the words \"heroin,\" \"hash,\" and \"crack\" can be heard during some dialogue. Dialogue also contains the words \"f**k\" and \"sh*t.\"","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/113400"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/APB:_All_Points_Bulletin"}]}
