You play a orange ball with 3 appendages: 2 legs and a snout. Q*bert is very good at hopping and does so on a isometric grid in the shape of a pyramid. \nQ*Bert 3 takes this simple premise and applies it to varying themes and forms of the grid. There are a total of 20 levels with 4 boards per level of increasing difficulty. Happy hopping!","collection":4087,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[60044,25222,25646,20329,14047,26223,56279,36608,34919,56292],"tags":[1,268435465,536872407,536873787,536875361],"category":0,"keywords":[1495,2875,4449],"themes":[1],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":720576000000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":720576000000,"region":8,"human":"1992-Nov-01","y":1992,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kg2uyfwowph98yecnggb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kg2uyfwowph98yecnggb","width":387,"height":266}}
