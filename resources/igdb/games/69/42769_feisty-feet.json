It\u2019s a take on the side-scrolling running game popularized by Canabalt. You control a little guy who runs toward the right side of the screen, leaping over obstacles and from platform to platform, most of which are at different heights. \nInstead of it being an infinite runner, they\u2019ve changed the gameplay so it\u2019s a race with other runners. It\u2019s not just a simple race, though; it reminds me more of a kart racer. You have special power-ups that give you a speed boost and make you jump. You can also pick up weapons, ranging from a simple snowball to a rocket launcher and some sort of tangle grenade that you drop behind you to stop an opposing runner briefly.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[23314,1070,18699,38989,1194,1073,76259,41118,38305,10039],"tags":[268435464,268435466],"category":0,"genres":[8,10]}
