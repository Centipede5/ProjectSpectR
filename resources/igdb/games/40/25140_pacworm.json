Your objective is to eat 10 \"foods\" that appear randomly on the field. Each time you gobble a food, your worm gets longer; if you hit anything except the food (like walls or yourself), you use a life. If you've eaten 10 foods, a door opens and you can leave the level, coming to the next level with additional walls. There is also time limit of sorts: if you'll not eat next food in given time range, it will multiply and counter of \"needed food\" will go up.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36794,36608,34919,51485,22819,40524,51683,24199,23175,16468],"tags":[1,268435489,1073741827],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"themes":[1],"genres":[33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[13],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":410140800000,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bdnkxnr2nsmsqs3mwf0k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bdnkxnr2nsmsqs3mwf0k","width":560,"height":350}}
