When you're a 'Mech Mercenary, you call the shots. You don't fight for honor - you fight for cold hard cash, a fierce reputation, and the heart-pounding thrill of the kill. Your allegiance goes to the highest bidder. You answer only to the call of fortune. Your fate is in your hands alone. Select from 4 of the most notorious mercenary units, Kell Hounds, Wolf's Dragoons, Northwind Highlanders, and Gray Death Legion, to alter your missions, with different outcomes based on your victories. Choose from over 35 different 'Mechs, including 10 new ones. And for the first time ever, your secondary lance allows you to muster 8 'Mechs into battle simultaneously. Or make a killing in the infamous Solaris VII arenas, where fighting dirty can make you filthy rich. Includes 'Mechs from the Black Knight expansion for Mechwarrior 4, and is fully compatible with Mechwarrior 4 'Mech Packs. Fight for fame. Fight for fortune.
