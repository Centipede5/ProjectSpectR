It was also released as Axe of Rage in North America. The game is the sequel to Barbarian: The Ultimate Warrior (Death Sword in North America), which was published in 1987. In Barbarian II, the player controls a princess or barbarian character, exploring the game world to locate and defeat an evil wizard. The game's plot is an extension of its predecessor, although the gameplay is different. While the first game offers two players the opportunity for virtual head-to-head combat, the second is solely a single-player adventure with fewer fighting moves.","collection":1592,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[47823,12632,27209,16468,19333,10039,68391,17583,36926,19698],"tags":[1,17,268435460,536871059,536871139,536871208,536871565,536875331,536876057,536876355,536876499,536877283,536878147,536880564,1073741828],"developers":[2080],"publishers":[2080,366],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[147,227,296,653,4419,5145,5443,5587,6371,7235,9652],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":581558400000,"platforms":[63,134,69,13,16,15,26,25,27],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":134,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":69,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":26,"date":581558400000,"region":1,"human":"1988-Jun-06","y":1988,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":581558400000,"region":1,"human":"1988-Jun-06","y":1988,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":581558400000,"region":2,"human":"1988-Jun-06","y":1988,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":63,"date":581558400000,"region":2,"human":"1988-Jun-06","y":1988,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Barbarian II","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Barbarian 2","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Axe of Rage","comment":"U.S. Title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/a1ez6j3ylej1y554ngrg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a1ez6j3ylej1y554ngrg","width":320,"height":200},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/egkpgaqwlajdinuz3qz1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"egkpgaqwlajdinuz3qz1","width":320,"height":256}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/u2kjmdiatoton4uefoab.jpg","cloudinary_id":"u2kjmdiatoton4uefoab","width":304,"height":364},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Barbarian_II:_The_Dungeon_of_Drax"}]}
