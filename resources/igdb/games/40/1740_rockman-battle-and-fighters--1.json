{"id":1740,"name":"Rockman: Battle & Fighters","slug":"rockman-battle-and-fighters--1","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/rockman-battle-and-fighters--1","created_at":1352059888678,"updated_at":1543014982973,"summary":"Rockman Battle & Fighters is a fighting game similar to the two arcade titles Mega Man: The Power Battle, and Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters. Playing as one of four characters (Mega Man, Proto Man, Bass, and Duo), the player chooses between three sets of boss battles with various Robot Masters from the series. The battles are fought linearly in any order, and after each boss is defeated, a special weapon is added to the player's arsenal. Each boss is weak to one specific weapon, so the player is encouraged to strategize the order in which the bosses are faced. Two players can use a link cable to transfer database information between systems, but no co-op or versus play is supported.","collection":337,"franchise":38,"franchises":[38],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[55038,1731,76566,36950,68287,43465,25300,76428,57187,90101],"tags":[1,18,268435460,268435466,268435489,536870937,536870990,536871019,536871192,536871835,536871882,536872225,536872594,536874539,536874824,536875069,536875199,536875734,536875955,536879696,1073741828],"developers":[37],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[25,78,107,280,923,970,1313,1682,3627,3912,4157,4287,4822,5043,8784],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[4,10,33],"first_release_date":962841600000,"platforms":[120],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":120,"date":962841600000,"region":5,"human":"2000-Jul-06","y":2000,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3 \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb&\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/co1hre.jpg","cloudinary_id":"co1hre","width":639,"height":643},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Rockman_Battle_%26_Fighters"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/megaman.wikia.com\/wiki\/Rockman_Battle_%26_Fighters"}]}
