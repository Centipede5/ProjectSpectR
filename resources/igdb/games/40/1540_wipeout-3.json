Players compete in obstacle courses that include hazards such as swinging pads, punching gloves, and giant wrecking balls. Unsuccessful attempts at obstacles (i.e., \u201cwipeouts\u201d) can cause contestants to fall into pools of mud and water; wipeouts generally depict flailing bodies, cries of pain, and thumping sound effects. Throughout the game, commentators can be heard exchanging humorous remarks in the background (e.g., \u201cI plan on leaving the Big Balls all black and blue,\u201d\u201cI've got the spunk, the funk, and the junk in da trunk,\u201d and \u201cAre those Big Balls, or am I looking in a mirror?\u201d).","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wipeout_3"}]}
