Players use an arm cannon to shoot laser projectiles at enemies; players can also use a slashing melee attack to defeat stronger enemies. Alien creatures generally cry out in pain then disappear when defeated. Some hand-drawn images briefly depict dead aliens on the ground. One scene briefly depicts an alien corpse in a puddle of green blood.
