Now, for the first time, fans outside of Japan will get a taste of this classic game on the Nintendo 3DS family of systems. Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia is inspired by the 1992 original, reimagined on a grander scale. Every aspect of the Fire Emblem Gaiden game's presentation has been updated, along with the game being fully voiced. Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia recreates classic Fire Emblem gameplay with a modern twist, mixing in exploration of dungeons crawling with enemies.\"","storyline":"Fire Emblem Echoes follows the same basic plot as Fire Emblem Gaiden, with the protagonists Alm and Celica fighting in a war that has consumed the nations of Rigel and Zofia on the continent of Valentia. Echoes introduces new characters to the story that did not exist in Gaiden such as a new friend of Alm, Faye, and a new villain in Berkut (which replace Seazas in Act 4), as well as a new prologue that expands on Alm and Celica's childhood relationship. Additionally, a sixth chapter is added after the end of the original Gaiden story, expanding on the lore of Valentia and connecting the game to Awakening.","collection":303,"franchise":769,"franchises":[769],"hypes":1,"rating":82.8823633071297,"popularity":4,"aggregated_rating":81.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":82.1078483202315,"total_rating_count":29,"rating_count":19,"games":[26845,7615,103303,13196,75848,26841,42010,23183,26940,55029],"tags":[17,39,268435468,268435471,268435472,536871490,536874375,536882999,536883033,536883468,1073741826,1073741827],"developers":[765],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":121620},"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[578,3463,12087,12121,12556],"themes":[17,39],"genres":[12,15,16],"first_release_date":1492646400000,"pulse_count":65,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1495238400000,"region":3,"human":"2017-May-20","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1495152000000,"region":1,"human":"2017-May-19","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1495152000000,"region":2,"human":"2017-May-19","y":2017,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1492646400000,"region":5,"human":"2017-Apr-20","y":2017,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"FE15","comment":"Acronym"},{"name":"\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a8\u30e0\u30d6\u30ec\u30e0 Echoes \u3082\u3046\u3072\u3068\u308a\u306e\u82f1\u96c4\u738b","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xyjmux3spsp3s2s4dpqm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xyjmux3spsp3s2s4dpqm","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tox5gve76189oya3235b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tox5gve76189oya3235b","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xcoel0gewpibutw2l9lg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xcoel0gewpibutw2l9lg","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nptsvb3qfoeecvu2fcd5.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nptsvb3qfoeecvu2fcd5","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ymilv1qc9qeoqxai40e8.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ymilv1qc9qeoqxai40e8","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/srdhiu6iiu2feyeo9jbp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"srdhiu6iiu2feyeo9jbp","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fzq2lysgxbl0qolmsuwe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fzq2lysgxbl0qolmsuwe","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/huypturp6tvbdn2prfrt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"huypturp6tvbdn2prfrt","width":400,"height":240},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lkfa8hs7ximnhk2awlmp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lkfa8hs7ximnhk2awlmp","width":931,"height":559},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/iidnklxl6nbkdee9w5ci.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iidnklxl6nbkdee9w5ci","width":800,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/edqsakpzumxtwny3njka.jpg","cloudinary_id":"edqsakpzumxtwny3njka","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jyvqlazzu83gq8wcaria.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jyvqlazzu83gq8wcaria","width":800,"height":480}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"y5EKO0CdRZ4"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zcxsqolmknii0q1q3zhz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zcxsqolmknii0q1q3zhz","width":600,"height":549},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a strategy role-playing game in which players follow the story of childhood friends involved in a conflict between warring kingdoms. Players interact with characters and engage in turn-based battles against enemy soldiers and creatures. Battles are depicted from an overhead perspective, with characters moving around a grid while selecting attack moves from a menu. Attacks are shown in brief, slow-motion sequences that depict characters slashing each other with swords, shooting arrows, and casting magic spells. One scene depicts a character with blood on his clothes and dripping from his mouth. Some female characters wear low-cut outfits that reveal deep cleavage; the dialogue contains some suggestive references (e.g., \u201cYou were drooling all over yourself after that buxom maid offered her 'thanks.'\u201d). During the course of the game, players' character can acquire wine and ale items. The words \u201ca*s\u201d and \u201cbastard\u201d appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game has been rated PEGI 12 for depictions of non-realistic looking violence towards human-like characters, and use of mild bad language.
