There are six rows of rocks to deal with. The game starts with a six-storied platform and the player loses one platform per row of rocks cleared. The player scores points for those rocks they prevent from reaching the ground. The farther the row of rocks, the smaller and faster they become. The ultimate goal is to get enough points so that the player can continue the game should they lose their first one.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":255139200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":255139200000,"region":8,"human":"1978-Feb-01","y":1978,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vuexwufr8w2y0ww9t8cd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vuexwufr8w2y0ww9t8cd","width":850,"height":1106}}
