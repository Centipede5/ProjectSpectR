Mrs. Bear has finally caught up with him though, and is demanding that he finds enough fruit (326 apples should do it!) for them to last the approaching Winter. \n \nHe won't be allowed home until his task is complete. To add to his troubles, all of the other animals are looking for food too, so best steer clear of them! \n \nVenture out into the wild to find all of the fruit from the areas around Bear's home. Yes, even the strange glowing fruit from the abandoned mine that Bear has been itching to explore lately. \n \nRumour has it that the mine was sealed up back in the 80's after a whole SPECTRUM of problems... \n \nWhat could be down there?!","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1485216000000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":1485216000000,"region":8,"human":"2017-Jan-24","y":2017,"m":1}]}
