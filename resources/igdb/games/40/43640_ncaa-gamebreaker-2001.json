You start out as a bottom-rung coach at one of the 115 division 1-A college teams and as your performance increases, you obtain promotions and offers from other schools. At the end of the season, you're able to export your players to NFL GameDay. As with the previous games, broadcaster Keith Jackson returns to provide voice commentary.","popularity":1,"games":[46820,39665,101684,101567,101100,100907,100887,100879,100863,100832],"tags":[268435470],"category":0,"genres":[14],"first_release_date":979862400000,"platforms":[8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":979862400000,"region":8,"human":"2001-Jan-19","y":2001,"m":1}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pj35udoc0yqlrmjztfxk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pj35udoc0yqlrmjztfxk","width":1527,"height":2156}}
