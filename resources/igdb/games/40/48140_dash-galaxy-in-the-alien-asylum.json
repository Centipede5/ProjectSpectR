Players take the role of Dash Galaxy, a space scout who has been captured by a hostile civilization. Gameplay involves a series of floors with several rooms each. Keys must be collected to progress to higher floors and, eventually, an escape ship. Dash's only weapons are a limited supply of bombs and remote detonators. Good timing is crucial to completing the game, requiring navigation of trampoline jumps and roaming enemies. While the rooms are side-scrolling action puzzles, the floors have a overhead view and include more difficult block-moving puzzles which can fatally trap a player.","popularity":2,"games":[33726,55038,68287,28029,60044,77657,36950,25300,27011,24426],"tags":[1,18,268435465,536871882,536873787,536876348],"category":0,"keywords":[970,2875,5436],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":638928000000,"platforms":[18],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":18,"date":638928000000,"region":8,"human":"1990-Apr-01","y":1990,"m":4}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lq4qmcstaqfg4znqtyh7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lq4qmcstaqfg4znqtyh7","width":480,"height":360},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rdpxeouvjevovszdd338.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rdpxeouvjevovszdd338","width":512,"height":480},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t5ehygimk1ygskzthcxz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t5ehygimk1ygskzthcxz","width":259,"height":194}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xeuv4oi3oca3kbeolnm1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xeuv4oi3oca3kbeolnm1","width":1526,"height":2100}}
