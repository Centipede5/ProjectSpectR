{"id":41140,"name":"Vultures","slug":"vultures","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/vultures","created_at":1498812811044,"updated_at":1500261767392,"summary":"Vultures is an original (?) shoot'em'up with a slight Galaga flavour. Above your spaceship hangs a nest of space-vultures. One after one, they come down to shoot at you. Unlike Galaga, they don't wrap at the end of the screen, instead they \"bounce\" back and forth across it. Mind the vulture's course, because otherwise you might find yourself trapped in a corner with the inevitable collision as only way out. A good tactic to ameliorate your chances is to dodge the vulture's bullets and concentrate your fire on its mates that are left hanging above. When all the vultures are killed, their eggs start to hatch and spawn similarly devious creatures. Shoot them down, and you have passed the first level. \n \nVultures has three speed settings and runs in medium resolution with a green background.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":412905600000,"platforms":[15],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":15,"date":412905600000,"region":8,"human":"1983-Feb-01","y":1983,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w8b5yziqoxtob1royude.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w8b5yziqoxtob1royude","width":768,"height":532}]}
