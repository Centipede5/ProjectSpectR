Players' objective is to save the original \"Splosion Man\" from evil scientists. Ms. Splosion Man runs through levels while triggering fiery explosions in front of scientists and giant robot creatures. When enemies explode, they generally turn into \"cartoony\" chunks of meat (i.e., hams, sausages, turkey legs, hot dogs). During the course of the game, a boss creature is depicted with exaggerated-sized breasts that sometimes jiggle; Ms. Splosion Man sometimes makes suggestive comments during gameplay (e.g., \"Like a virgin, wooo,\" \"Vajazzled,\" \"Not tonight, I have a headache.\"). Song lyrics also contain some suggestive material (e.g., \". . . big round mounds, then boom\/Shake your rump to the sweet sound\" and \"[Y]our rump is looking dandy . . . You're making me feel so randy\"). In the opening tutorial, a voiceover jokes about a player's hands twitching \"like a heroin junkie.\"","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ms._Splosion_Man"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/mssplosionman.com\/"},{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/105420"}],"external":{"steam":"105420"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":4,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
