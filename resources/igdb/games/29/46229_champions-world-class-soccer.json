Shown from a slightly tilted 3rd-person side perspective, players can do an exhibition match, full tournament or go against a human player in the 2-player exhibition mode. The different teams are ranked by speed, offense and defence, and different team formations can be selected. \n \nThe gameplay is very basic: players can pass, shoot, tackle with a third button used to switch between players. In the options menu, fouls and offside can be disabled, the amount of time per half can be determined and there is a radar and mini-map to track the other players. The European edition is endorsed by Ryan Giggs and the game uses a password system to continue tournaments","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[18681,42355,42477,54662,15851,6685,72820,56409,48388,38179],"tags":[268435470,536870938,536875138,536875139,536875140,536878125],"category":0,"keywords":[26,4226,4227,4228,7213],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":728524800000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":728524800000,"region":8,"human":"1993-Feb-01","y":1993,"m":2}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"8hDFdRavC6k"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cse9bfvt7i1pz1qmpydz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cse9bfvt7i1pz1qmpydz","width":395,"height":266}}
