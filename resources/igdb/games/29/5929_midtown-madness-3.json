For the first time in the series, the game was released only on the Xbox, with a Windows version rumoured for later release, but ultimately scrapped.[citation needed] \n \nThe game was developed by DICE (of Battlefield 1942 fame) and published by Microsoft Game Studios. This marked a change from the developer of the first two games, Angel Studios (now Rockstar San Diego). Coincidentally, Midtown Madness 3 was released in 2003 against Midnight Club II, created by the developer of the first two games, Rockstar San Diego. \n \nThe Xbox-only release and change of developer heralded a significant graphical improvement to maintain the console's graphical standards.","collection":477,"rating":70.66482588864889,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":85,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":77.83241294432445,"total_rating_count":8,"rating_count":5,"games":[44242,40470,27744,18623,35099,29173,27378,32457,55689,68049],"tags":[38,268435466,268435469,536872060,536872371,536872695,536872983,536875069,536875154,536875743,536875802,536879193,536880961,536883143,536884029],"developers":[4175,94],"publishers":[53,2594],"category":0,"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[1148,1459,1783,2071,4157,4242,4831,4890,8281,10049,12231,13117],"themes":[38],"genres":[10,13],"first_release_date":1055808000000,"platforms":[11,55],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1055808000000,"human":"2003-Jun-17","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":55,"date":1082592000000,"human":"2004-Apr-22","y":2004,"m":4}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"_p01VAVnlKM"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"Vys-7jve7OE"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kgb6b8cp168daylu1fbi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kgb6b8cp168daylu1fbi","width":256,"height":364},"esrb":{"rating":3},"pegi":{"rating":1}}
