Birthright, the easiest path, has the ability to use scouting missions to grind experience and money and simpler mission objectives that give greater amounts of experience and money. Revelation is in the middle as the scouting missions are available but the mission objectives are similar to Conquest's. This is ignoring the 3 difficulty settings in-game.\n\n\n\"Two kingdoms at war \u2013 the peace-loving Hoshido and the glory-seeking Nohr \u2013 It\u2019s up to the player to decide which side to take. As the prince\/princess of Hoshido, who was raised by Nohr royal family, you will be torn between two families you love. Whichever path you take, you will face different types of challenges.\"","collection":303,"franchise":769,"franchises":[769],"hypes":3,"rating":79.90735026413131,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":87,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":83.45367513206565,"total_rating_count":16,"rating_count":5,"games":[7615,28182,27092,26845,26940,26765,26553,19404,14394,40477],"tags":[17,31,268435468,268435471,268435472,536871208,536871938,536872098,536873141,536874694,536875057,536875081,536875472,536875587,536875753,536875754,536875767,536875781,536875831,536876656,536878558,1073741827],"developers":[765,2935],"publishers":[70],"category":3,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[296,1026,1186,2229,3782,4145,4169,4560,4675,4841,4842,4855,4869,4919,5744,7646],"themes":[17,31],"genres":[12,15,16],"dlcs":[18038],"first_release_date":1455840000000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1455840000000,"region":2,"human":"2016-Feb-19","y":2016,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1463702400000,"region":1,"human":"2016-May-20","y":2016,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1456012800000,"region":3,"human":"2016-Feb-21","y":2016,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2\u30fc\u30a8\u30e0\u30d6\u30ec\u30e0if","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Fire Emblem Fates - Limited Edition"},{"name":"Fire Emblem If: Special Edition","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Fire Emblem Fates"},{"name":"Fire Emblem If","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Fire Emblem If: Hoshido","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Fire Emblem If: Nohr","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Fire Emblem Fates: Conquest","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Fire Emblem Fates: Revelation","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o1arqw6hhjgkklxtbbip.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o1arqw6hhjgkklxtbbip","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hw21zfqyveeudpakpdyu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hw21zfqyveeudpakpdyu","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/sk37gbnumxmurhk0frtp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sk37gbnumxmurhk0frtp","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/w2xz0yfuyvcfqecqlych.jpg","cloudinary_id":"w2xz0yfuyvcfqecqlych","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hfd5wm1smykdd2zwwxqc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hfd5wm1smykdd2zwwxqc","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"vtfBsACbzr0"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/y93v04lxa6je18lzvzhw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"y93v04lxa6je18lzvzhw","width":1500,"height":1326},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Sexual images and\/or sexual innuendo - Mild bad language","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fire_Emblem_Fates"}]}
