Earthsiege 2 is set in the Earthsiege universe, which contains its predecessors Earthsiege (1994) and Battledrome (1995), as well as the action game Hunter Hunted (1996), strategy games MissionForce: CyberStorm (1997) and Cyberstorm 2: Corporate Wars (1998), simulation Starsiege (1999), and first-person shooters Starsiege: Tribes (1999), Tribes 2 (2001), Tribes Aerial Assault (2002), Tribes: Vengeance (2004) and Tribes: Ascend (2012).\n\nAs a simulation, Earthsiege 2 gives players the opportunity to pilot massive bipedal war machines known as HERCULANs (Humaniform-Emulation Roboticized Combat Unit with Leg-Articulated Navigation) (or 'HERCs' for short). Set in the 26th or 27th century, Earthsiege 2 features advanced weapons and technology for waging war. Earthsiege 2 takes place across North America, South America, Antarctica, Asia, Australia, Europe, and the moon.\n\nEarthsiege 2 features a more advanced engine than Earthsiege, increasing the game's maximum resolution to 640*480. Additionally, the game features much more detailed terrain than its predecessor. Earthsiege 2 has 3D rolling terrain rather than the flat landscape of Earthsiege. Furthermore, video briefings and debriefings, along with included squadmate voices, add to the atmosphere of the game.","collection":1496,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[25311,26145,44076,19934,34919,44242,19301,18623,23212,22470],"tags":[1,18,268435469,536870937,536870981,536871079,536872060,536874539,536874947,536875265,536875309,536875426,536876028,536876990,536880210,536880222,1073741825],"developers":[317],"publishers":[32],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[25,69,167,1148,3627,4035,4353,4397,4514,5116,6078,9298,9310],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[13],"first_release_date":851990400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":6,"date":851990400000,"human":"1996","y":1996,"m":12}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ugQUwJyEHAE"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gbkbq3xum1mf46htfhnn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gbkbq3xum1mf46htfhnn","width":640,"height":776},"esrb":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.sierragamers.com\/Earthsiege-2"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Earthsiege_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/tribes.wikia.com\/wiki\/EarthSiege_2"}]}
