As the name implies, it is loosely based on (and not licensed by) the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Bronze or silver medals are not good enough - you have to go for the gold to get to the next event. However, you must at least qualify in each event in order to compete in the next event.","collection":2922,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46820,79470,76131,43012,24159,20321,13254,18681,39665,69361],"tags":[268435470,536871534],"category":0,"keywords":[622],"genres":[14],"first_release_date":570672000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":570672000000,"region":8,"human":"1988-Feb-01","y":1988,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Hyper Sports Special","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Konami '88","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xuab3xmk9fo3qopswczw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xuab3xmk9fo3qopswczw","width":1920,"height":1080}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ka1eqahhkg07cca3aphn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ka1eqahhkg07cca3aphn","width":850,"height":1129}}
