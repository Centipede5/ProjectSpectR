During the course of the game, some female demons are depicted with bare breasts (no nipples) and exposed buttocks; other demons have phallic-shaped heads and\/or torsos. Descriptions of demons sometimes include sexual references: \u201cThey visit sleeping men and have sexual intercourse with them.\u201d The words \u201csh*t\u201d and \u201ca*shole\u201d appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/atlus.com\/smt4a\/home.html"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/megamitensei.wikia.com\/wiki\/Shin_Megami_Tensei_IV_Apocalypse"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shin_Megami_Tensei_IV:_Apocalypse"}]}
