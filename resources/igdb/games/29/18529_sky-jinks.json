You have to pass the red pylons on the right side and the blue ones on the left side. Missing a pylon will result in a three second penalty. Flying into the pylons, trees or hot-air balloons will cost you time as well. There are five different game modes: The first four game modes only differ in terms of the number of pylons you have to pass (25, 50, 75, 99). In th fifth game mode you still have to pass 99 pylons but they are placed along the course randomly. You can also change the difficulty level from easy to hard which will place obstacles like trees either directly in your line of flight or out of your way.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28856,51485,40470,36794,36608,34919,36662,25322,18121,16468],"tags":[1,268435466,268435489,536871525,536875069,1073741827],"developers":[66],"publishers":[66],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[613,4157],"themes":[1],"genres":[10,33],"first_release_date":410140800000,"platforms":[59],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":59,"date":410140800000,"region":2,"human":"1982","y":1982,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/i0ycyckbfxoh7u2x2cfe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"i0ycyckbfxoh7u2x2cfe","width":1000,"height":1398},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
