In the middle of the game, when the number of known girls was high, these \"bombs\" became the primary concern of the player, forcing careful planning and strategies like round-robin dating. Although the feature was still present in the later games, it was considerably reduced in importance and the difficulty in avoiding it.","collection":3447,"popularity":2,"games":[44686,44242,19897,7364,27744,18623,32457,31515,29173,22422],"tags":[268435469,536871006,536871270,536871758,536872060,536872617,536873364,536873736,536875318,536875762,536875896,536876976,536877237,536880094,536882765],"category":0,"keywords":[94,358,846,1148,1705,2452,2824,4406,4850,4984,6064,6325,9182,11853],"genres":[13],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kh8ljjnejgx7rt9yocvq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kh8ljjnejgx7rt9yocvq","width":1888,"height":1451}}
