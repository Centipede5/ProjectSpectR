It is up \nto the player to select a packing item or items and use the on-screen controls \nto pack them tightly past (or mostly past) the packing line -- which moves \naccording to the game selected. There are 30 games you can play in Pack a Truck. \nGames 1-4 consist of boxes and balls, while Games 5-6 include furniture and \nodds and ends. Games 7-18 are like 1-6, but the movers want you to pack \nitems tighter -- the line on the floor is moved. Robot helpers in Games 19-24 \ntry to assist, but they sometimes fail. In Games 25-30 hit toy planes with \npacking items to wreck them and earn points. Planes turn red when they are \nalmost destroyed. Movers shake the truck in game 30. \n \nPoints are scored for every packing item that is behind (or mostly behind) the packing line. Additional points are scored for tightly packing items (packing items that touch each other). In general, the bigger the packing item, the more points that are scored for packing it. Balls, capsules, and cylinders are worth a bit more than other objects of the same size, because they tend to be harder to keep packed. \nDestroyed planes are worth as much as or more than the largest packing item.","storyline":"It's the future, and robots pack moving trucks using sensitive remote controls. \nThe robots recently broke down, so it's up to you to help a family move with an \nodd collection of furniture and peculiar items.
