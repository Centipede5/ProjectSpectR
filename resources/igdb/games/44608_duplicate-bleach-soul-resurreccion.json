Gamers can role-play through re-creations of their favorite plotlines from the Bleach comics and cartoon series, or seek out new side-adventures in the freely roamed game world, stocked with random encounters and fan-friendly details. Cel-shaded graphics add interactive depth, in the anime's distinctive visual style. In addition to Ichigo, gamers may play through the mission-driven stories of 20 other characters from the popular manga and animated series. By choosing which new powers and abilities to unlock, characters can be custom-developed as they earn experience. The combat-centric action involves super-human swordplay and supernatural powers, and battles sometimes develop Dynasty Warriors-style odds, as the player's lone hero must aggressively fend through deluges of enemy opponents. The game's Mission Mode offers a goal-oriented alternative to the Story Mode's character-based campaigns.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[91140,76253,103298,48663,36608,100949,76358,103281,1070,57693],"tags":[1,536872006],"category":0,"keywords":[1094],"themes":[1],"first_release_date":1314921600000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1314921600000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Sep-02","y":2011,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qej9whvyngmp3qzurhz6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qej9whvyngmp3qzurhz6","width":1000,"height":1163}}
