{"id":18381,"name":"Pac & Pal","slug":"pac-and-pal","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/pac-and-pal","created_at":1458154495303,"updated_at":1515754678622,"summary":"Pac & Pal is an arcade game that was released by Namco on July 30, 1983 exclusively in Japan. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware, and the object of the game is for Pac-Man to eat all the items before he is caught by the ghosts. Most of the items are fruits from the original Pac-Man game, with a few new additions. Their value varies, starting with cherries at 50 points, and ending with keys from 700 to 5000 points. The items had to first be unlocked by turning over cards distributed around the maze (instead of eating keys like in Super Pac-Man). Very few cabinets still exist today, and this is possibly one of the rarest Pac-Man titles to find in playable format outside Japan.","collection":2095,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[2750,21681,46814,7170,50327,7452,20900,3759,23240,46813],"tags":[1,34,268435465,268435489,536870928,536871446,536871599,536872352,536872847,536873064,536873787,536875074,536875076,536875096,536875119,536875396,536875397,536875404,536875517,536875607,536875639,536875661,536875666,536875691,536875870,536876120,536876435,536876657,536876658,536876713,536876716,536876718,536877277,536878417,536884865,1073741828],"developers":[263],"publishers":[263],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[16,534,687,1440,1935,2152,2875,4162,4164,4184,4207,4484,4485,4492,4605,4695,4727,4749,4754,4779,4958,5208,5523,5745,5746,5801,5804,5806,6365,7505,13953],"themes":[1,34],"genres":[9,33],"first_release_date":428371200000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":428371200000,"region":5,"human":"1983-Jul-30","y":1983,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/kkmops6tysw80ns9jd2j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kkmops6tysw80ns9jd2j","width":252,"height":355}}
