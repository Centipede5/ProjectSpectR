It has a US setting in terms of the courses and players, unlike PGA European Tour, with 8 courses in total. Control is via the standard method of setting the shot up, then pressing the button once to start a swing, a second time to set the pace, and a third time to set draw\/fade. Before taking a shot the club choice, direction and intended draw\/fade (spin on the ball) are selected. You can play a 72-hole tournament against 60 other PGA pros, or practice the holes at your leisure.","collection":4867,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[29173,55590,18623,19934,23345,9199,19376,55689,19847,19301],"tags":[268435469,268435470,268435471,536872060,536872078,536874694,536875627,536875824,536876437,536881408],"category":0,"keywords":[1148,1166,3782,4715,4912,5525,10496],"genres":[13,14,15],"first_release_date":760060800000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":760060800000,"region":8,"human":"1994-Feb-01","y":1994,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"PGA Tour Golf 3","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yfejy1hbr67q29er4k61.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yfejy1hbr67q29er4k61","width":223,"height":318}}
