The setting of the series and purportedly of the game is an extraterrestrial American Wild West, with the player fighting to defend settlers from airborne pirates -- the game, though, actually looks to be an entirely standard military-themed shooter, with the player's jet fighter set against tanks and other airplanes. Guns and bombs are levelled-up and collected by dropped power-ups, which are money-themed, with the gun upgrades shown as American dimes and bombs as gold bars.","collection":4796,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[28029,76246,19341,10039,32902,68287,68142,28751,10209,54639],"tags":[1,268435461,536871078,536872552],"category":0,"keywords":[166,1640],"themes":[1],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":666144000000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":666144000000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-10","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tqzyntrtebh9psgrdpjy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tqzyntrtebh9psgrdpjy","width":404,"height":344}}
