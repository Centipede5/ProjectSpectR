Your mission is to bounce your clown off of a moving trampoline and try to burst all of the balloons. The longer you keep him jumping, the higher (and faster) he will go, which you need to do in order to burst the highest balloons. You get bonus points for completing each row of balloons as well.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[76253,103312,103301,103298,91140,105049,76747,37419,99737,78632],"tags":[1,536875071,536875179],"category":0,"keywords":[4159,4267],"themes":[1],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nzrvyhepvug0eb60so8n.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nzrvyhepvug0eb60so8n","width":1534,"height":2100}}
