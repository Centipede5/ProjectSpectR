It's again a game that can be played by two players though a single player game is also a possibility. If played by two players they can cooperate by docking the jets together, docked side-by-side or end-to-end for greater fire and fighting power. When docked one player is the pilot and the other is the weapons officer.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[46892,41258,76246,19341,28029,32902,97018,96550,93794,88910],"tags":[268435461],"category":0,"genres":[5],"first_release_date":556243200000,"platforms":[27],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":27,"date":556243200000,"region":8,"human":"1987-Aug-18","y":1987,"m":8}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fzhzppogltb5lwqz455h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fzhzppogltb5lwqz455h","width":2212,"height":3128}}
