Europe sees the dawn of the golden age of the new departures and the free spirit. Under the rule of the bourgeoisie and businessmen, more and more towns are emerging from the clutches of the aristocracy and are achieving independence, power and wealth. New businesses are flourishing, bringing financial strength and political influence to a growing economy.\n\nHowever, life in the narrow, overpopulated alleyways and streets of the towns also has its downsides: epidemics and diseases are spreading, and thieves and highwaymen lie in wait to get their piece of the wealth. Now you can try your hand in these exciting times of change. Will you head down the path of an honest craftsman or a dubious priest? It\u2019s your choice.","collection":890,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36553,23345,55036,18623,29173,55590,30229,79134,30457,28794],"tags":[22,268435467,268435469,268435471,536871063,536871906,536871938,536874694,536875530,536883035,1073741827],"developers":[516],"publishers":[270],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[151,994,1026,3782,4618,12123],"themes":[22],"genres":[11,13,15],"first_release_date":1035504000000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1035504000000,"human":"2002-Oct-25","y":2002,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Europa 1400"},{"name":"The Guild"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tzhipjidzznmmsw3bgpy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tzhipjidzznmmsw3bgpy","width":640,"height":908},"esrb":{"rating":5}}
