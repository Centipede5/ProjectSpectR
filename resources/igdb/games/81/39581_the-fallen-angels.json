Money-crazed inhabitants soon lashed out for the city's remaining but useless vestiges of power, preaching salvation while hiding their wicked motives. \n \nSex, crime and drugs ruled the streets, as the city began to decay. Ironically, they called the wretched remains of their city \"Eden- the last paradise.\" \n \nIt is now a decade later. The year is 2010.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[1235,41828,10039,36794,2907,36608,34919,19658,22418,74155],"tags":[1,268435460,536871019],"category":0,"keywords":[107],"themes":[1],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":893980800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":893980800000,"region":8,"human":"1998-May-01","y":1998,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Daraku Tenshi","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/yluojrlbiqthwbvhab0h.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yluojrlbiqthwbvhab0h","width":1133,"height":1492}}
