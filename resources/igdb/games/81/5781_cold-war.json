It appears that the Cold War might actually be over.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone thinks that glasnost is a good thing. A fundamentalist faction within the Soviet government doesn't want the Cold War to thaw - they want it to heat up. Led by Barinsky, the radical head of the KGB, a group of separatists is making a last, desperate attempt to return the USSR to the control of the hard-line Communist regime by framing an American in a plot to assassinate the Soviet president and set off a chain of events that could very well lead to World War III.\n\nMatthew Carter, a hard-nosed American journalist following a tip from an informant, has just arrived in Moscow to cover a story. He is hoping that this assignment will lead to the story of a lifetime. Instead, it leads him into the thick of Barinsky's plot. Now, instead of vying for a Pulitzer Prize, Carter is fighting to clear his name, get to the bottom of Barinsky's sinister plan, and - hopefully - get out of the Soviet Union alive.","rating":50,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":56,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":53,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":2,"games":[103210,103020,95340,28029,103298,26192,22387,27088,37777,10039],"tags":[1,23,268435461,268435480,536870920,536871044,536871456,536872131,536873353,536873354,536875046,536876219,536876393,536884021,536884022,1073741826],"developers":[2547],"publishers":[2548,376,753],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[8,132,544,1219,2441,2442,4134,5307,5481,13109,13110],"themes":[1,23],"genres":[5,24],"first_release_date":1127779200000,"platforms":[6,11,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1127779200000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Sep-27","y":2005,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1127779200000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Sep-27","y":2005,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1129852800000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Oct-21","y":2005,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1350000000000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Oct-12","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1131667200000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Nov-11","y":2005,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/bdzzxmu9jvg02m86dwc7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bdzzxmu9jvg02m86dwc7","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vvrhdiunihzfvpsa4bog.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vvrhdiunihzfvpsa4bog","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cso0fivax0c1fm6x3luk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cso0fivax0c1fm6x3luk","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dgkmjxx9h6ul2vnociwj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dgkmjxx9h6ul2vnociwj","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tazpt6lcrtaa8qr5sifd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tazpt6lcrtaa8qr5sifd","width":1024,"height":768}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"TIJIweEXNdw"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/z8fw0lbypek9rwcqj0qs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"z8fw0lbypek9rwcqj0qs","width":256,"height":369},"esrb":{"synopsis":"-","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/260650"}],"external":{"steam":"260650"}}
