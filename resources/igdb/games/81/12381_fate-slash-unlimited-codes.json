Players engage in hand-to-hand battles by mostly kicking, punching, and blocking their way to victory until the opposing player's life meter runs out. Players can also trigger special moves (e.g., magic sword attacks) to cause larger amounts of damage to their opponents. One sequence depicts a male character impaling an opponent with a lance. Some female characters wear skintight outfits that expose deep cleavage, while other characters' breasts bounce noticeably during combat. The expletives 'bastard' and 'a*s' are stated in the dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Violence in a sporting context - Mild bad language - Violence causing minor injury only","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fate\/unlimited_codes"}]}
