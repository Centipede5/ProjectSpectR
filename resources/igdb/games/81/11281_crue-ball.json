It was inspired by the glam metal band M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and featured three Cr\u00fce songs: \"Dr. Feelgood\", \"Live Wire\" and \"Home Sweet Home\". The game's soundtrack by Brian L. Schmidt features heavy metal-style music.\nThe game's prototype name was Twisted Flipper. The producer of the game, Richard Robbins, initially pursued the name \"Headbanger Ball\", but MTV balked at a license and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce was added relatively late in development.\nThis game was designed by two people who actually worked on pinball games: Mark Sprenger (artist for such games as 1984's Space Shuttle, 1986's High Speed and 1990's Diner) and Brian L. Schmidt (composer for Space Station, Black Knight 2000 and various pinball games by Data East Pinball\/Sega Pinball (now Stern Pinball, Inc.).","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[43917,49322,48916,40850,25612,6130,51464,72860,38842,34919],"tags":[1,268435486,536871846,536873064,536875054,536875076,536875139,536875368,536875411,536875412,536875548,536875879,536876120,536876199,536876479,536876694,536877854],"developers":[3694],"publishers":[200,1],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[934,2152,4142,4164,4227,4456,4499,4500,4636,4967,5208,5287,5567,5782,6942],"themes":[1],"genres":[30],"first_release_date":725760000000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":725760000000,"region":1,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":29,"date":725760000000,"region":2,"human":"1992","y":1992,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":756864000000,"region":5,"human":"1993-Dec-26","y":1993,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Crue Ball\nTwisted Flipper","comment":"Other"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/cysazqdyhnuwzdsl4xqo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cysazqdyhnuwzdsl4xqo","width":291,"height":408}}
