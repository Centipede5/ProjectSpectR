This game features more tracks as well as a brand new weapon system. \nGameplay is similar but slightly different to previous games in the series. XGRA features a wide range of riders, tracks and bikes that can accelerate at an incredibly rapid rate, going from 0 to 300 mph in a matter of seconds. A returning feature is the ability to break sound barrier: upon reaching 750MPH, all sound effects will cut out, except for item collection sound, other tider's taunts, weapons firing, and in-game music. \n \nXGRA allows players to race for 8 different teams, with each team's bike having their own advantages and drawbacks such as Regeneration, Handling, Speed, Acceleration and Shielding.","collection":606,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":61,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":61,"total_rating_count":2,"games":[68287,71455,25300,36950,27314,64204,28029,28856,19448,25311],"tags":[1,18,268435466,536871015,536871377,536871882,536874337,536875069,536875117,536884027,1073741826],"developers":[1834],"publishers":[287],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[103,465,970,3425,4157,4205,13115],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1063238400000,"platforms":[11,21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1069632000000,"human":"2003-Nov-24","y":2003,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1063238400000,"human":"2003-Sep-11","y":2003,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1063756800000,"human":"2003-Sep-17","y":2003,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hxgff8pznlrbk3cyogro.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hxgff8pznlrbk3cyogro","width":256,"height":320},"esrb":{"rating":3}}
