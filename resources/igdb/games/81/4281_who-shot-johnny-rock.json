Instead of a wimpy pistol, you get a tommy gun (which doesn't need to be reloaded). Unfortunately, you also have limited ammo and need to buy more at times. Instead of lives you have a fixed supply of money, and each time you die you lose some cash. Lose it all and it's game over.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36832,68287,103020,25633,4254,18088,5373,11171,7291,10039],"tags":[1,268435461,268435489,536871045,536871127,536871128,536871336,536871642,536871937,536872197,536872328,536872581,536872696,536875140,536875262,536875281,536875358,536875426,536875523,536875631,536875900,536876482,536876663,536876923,536877801,536882445],"developers":[295,2372],"publishers":[2372],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[133,215,216,424,730,1025,1285,1416,1669,1784,4228,4350,4369,4446,4514,4611,4719,4988,5570,5751,6011,6889,11533],"themes":[1],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":694137600000,"platforms":[52,50,13,78],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":78,"date":788832000000,"region":2,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":694137600000,"region":2,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":694137600000,"region":2,"human":"1991","y":1991,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":50,"date":788832000000,"region":2,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/zdbbzaivvvjylgdnxf3k.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zdbbzaivvvjylgdnxf3k","width":1538,"height":3008},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence.","rating":4}}
