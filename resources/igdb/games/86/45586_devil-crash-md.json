Technosoft acquired a license to port the game to the Sega Mega Drive, calling it Devil Crash MD (\u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30af\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\uff2d\uff24) and releasing it in Japan. They would then license it to Tengen for localization overseas; Tengen censored a few graphics deemed too Satanic for western audiences and released the final product as Dragon's Fury in the US and Europe despite the TurboGrafx-16 version having been released internationally beforehand. While Naxat furthered the series itself, Tengen would later release a sequel, Dragon's Revenge, not under license from anyone.","popularity":1,"games":[36608,2940,40524,34919,71581,29660,1070,23175,76438,16468],"tags":[1],"category":0,"themes":[1],"first_release_date":689731200000,"platforms":[29],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":689731200000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Nov-10","y":1991,"m":11}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hsozn7vrk2r5kbmu6by1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hsozn7vrk2r5kbmu6by1","width":1440,"height":2020}}
