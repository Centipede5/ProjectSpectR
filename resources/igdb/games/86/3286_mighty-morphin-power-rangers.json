It was produced by Sega TruVideo and released by Sega in US and Europe in 1994. The game consists mostly of footage from nine episodes of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV series, which featured footage from Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger. \n \nGameplay requires the player to press certain buttons at precise moments throughout the game as they appear on screen. If the player misses, the health meter will drop. However, there are points in the game where the player can press a button unprompted for extra points. At the end of each level, the player's progress is tallied. The points earned will be used to refill the player's health meter and can even score an extra life. Footage from episodes of the television series was used for the game. This footage was heavily cut down for disc space and level length. As a result, the five-part \"Green With Evil\" serial was turned into four small segments for the game. \n \nThe game has a total of ten levels. Levels six and seven are playable only on normal and hard modes, and levels eight, nine, and ten are playable only on hard mode.","collection":3148,"franchise":147,"franchises":[147],"popularity":3.666666666666667,"version_parent":3324,"version_title":"Sega CD","games":[78258,36911,6732,1907,11423,14763,10039,18822,3324,7350],"tags":[1,268435460,268435464,268435481,268435487,536870926,536871019,536871079,536871139,536871894,536872143,536872205,536873299,536874398,536875046,536875054,536875157,536875196,536875289,536875291,536875304,536875306,536875445,536875590,536875610,536875611,536875654,536876208,536876694,536876704,536877029,536877575,536878359,536880983],"developers":[13897],"publishers":[112],"category":0,"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,107,167,227,982,1231,1293,2387,3486,4134,4142,4245,4284,4377,4379,4392,4394,4533,4678,4698,4699,4742,5296,5782,5792,6117,6663,7447,10071],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,8,25,31],"first_release_date":788832000000,"platforms":[78],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":78,"date":788832000000,"region":2,"human":"1994","y":1994,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers - Sega CD","comment":"Sega CD Version"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/s59d9iijnzi4ah2qttqt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s59d9iijnzi4ah2qttqt","width":854,"height":706},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/okooqttsiuwago8juy68.jpg","cloudinary_id":"okooqttsiuwago8juy68","width":861,"height":700},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/fv4djvkkiyhcb0a6qw5r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fv4djvkkiyhcb0a6qw5r","width":854,"height":707}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mqka7dx0ljk6sxrfejmq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mqka7dx0ljk6sxrfejmq","width":240,"height":415},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":3},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}
