From a 3\/4\u2013overhead perspective, players use swords, spears, whips, guns, and magic spells (e.g., fireballs and freezing spells) to attack fantastical creatures and bandits on grid-based battlefields; attacks are accompanied by slashing sounds, small explosions, and cries of pain. One special attack results in a brief spray of blood. During the course of the game, some of the dialogue references suggestive material (e.g., 'How about we skip the foreplay and go straight to the climax,' 'Any masochist would be thrilled to make your acquaintance,' and 'Are you one of those men who likes . . . other boys?!'). Some sequences depict drunken characters who have passed out from consuming too much alcohol; the dialogue also references drinking (e.g., 'He's totally plastered' and 'I'm going to drink until I can't drink anymore tonight!') and drugs (e.g., 'Now I don't know what kind of drugs you're smoking . . .'). The words 'sh*t,' 'b*tch,' and 'a*s' appear in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters - Sexual images and\/or sexual innuendo - Mild bad language.","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/app\/251150"},{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.trailsinthesky.com\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Legend_of_Heroes:_Trails_in_the_Sky"},{"category":2,"url":"http:\/\/legendofheroes.wikia.com\/wiki\/The_Legend_of_Heroes:_Trails_in_the_Sky"}],"external":{"steam":"251150"}}
