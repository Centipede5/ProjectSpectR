The SR-91 uses the VAWS (Variable Armor and Weapon System) which uses the Optica Weapon Arms. The Arms shield the ship from top and bottom attacks, provides back-up fire and using its Arm System can be positioned to fire in various angles depending on the current weapon. The SR-91 uses one of three different pick-up weapons: the red \"Taikuu Laser\", thin red beams that fire straight forward; the yellow \"Ring Laser\", yellow rings which can be aimed in all directions and provide good coverage; and the blue \"Hansha Ball\", blue spheres that can be also aimed in all directions and bounce off the walls. The only other pick-up items are Speed Ups and Speed Downs. Extends were set at the first 70,000 points and was added with every 80,000.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[10209,10213,10210,10212,28029,87818,46356,41633,40986,40257],"tags":[268435461,536871078],"category":0,"keywords":[166],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":665452800000,"platforms":[52],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":52,"date":665452800000,"region":8,"human":"1991-Feb-02","y":1991,"m":2}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jaqiczo7pqekihgyyrey.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jaqiczo7pqekihgyyrey","width":1280,"height":897}}
