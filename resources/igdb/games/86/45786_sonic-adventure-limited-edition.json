These discs included a trimmed down version of the game based on the Japanese release and had saving and network connectivity disabled along with other minor differences; they were known to be buggy. \n \nLater, a variant of the release was distributed to Hollywood Video as part of a pre-release promotion in which the game could be rented along with a console before it\u2019s official launch. This variant of the game allowed saving and included a case and manual. The disc, game manual cover, and spine of the case all state \u201cLimited Edition\u201d and the artwork differs slightly from the standard edition release. Due to it\u2019s exclusive distribution through a rental chain many of the original game cases were lost or destroyed and replaced in whole or in part with cases or manuals from the standard edition release, also many discs were tagged with a \u201cHollywood Video\u201d security sticker.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"category":0,"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xa6puyzkokbk8f3fvrrd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xa6puyzkokbk8f3fvrrd","width":1143,"height":1027}}
