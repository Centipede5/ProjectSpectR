It was originally written and released in June 2004 by Gerhard M\u00fcller. Set in classical antiquity, Travian is a predominantly militaristic real-time strategy game. \nTravian has been translated into over 40 languages from the original German version, and has over 5 million players on over 300 game servers worldwide. In 2006, it won the Superbrowsergame Award, in the large games category. \nTravian is programmed in PHP and runs in most modern browsers. Its creators may have drawn from an earlier German board game, The Settlers of Catan, for layout and the resource development theme.","hypes":1,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[327,23345,17583,22399,55029,2002,12982,30229,26841,26769],"tags":[22,268435467,268435468,268435471,536871139,536871208,536871475,536871561,536871812,536872245,536872383,536873066,536874445,536874694,536875312,536875372,536875679,536875891,536875897,536876263,536876315,536876416,536877816,536880645,536880744,536880745,536883773,1073741829],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1,2,3,5],"keywords":[227,296,563,649,900,1333,1471,2154,3533,3782,4400,4460,4767,4979,4985,5351,5403,5504,6904,9733,9832,9833,12861],"themes":[22],"genres":[11,12,15],"first_release_date":1094342400000,"platforms":[82],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":82,"date":1094342400000,"region":8,"human":"2004-Sep-05","y":2004,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ha9xom4rnixnyy4l0zhm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ha9xom4rnixnyy4l0zhm","width":520,"height":397}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"EIfPl4GXaYg"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/alhjbyctkghknr19gpqv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"alhjbyctkghknr19gpqv","width":2766,"height":1983},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http:\/\/www.travian.it\/"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Travian"}]}
