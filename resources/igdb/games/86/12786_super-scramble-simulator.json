{"id":12786,"name":"Super Scramble Simulator","slug":"super-scramble-simulator","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/super-scramble-simulator","created_at":1442689513304,"updated_at":1513003495614,"summary":"Super Scramble Simulator recreates the sport of scrambling\/ motorcross, but in a manner similar to the Kikstart TV show and games. The basic aim is to ride a motocross bike through hazardous courses within the time limits. \n \nThe game uses a split-screen display, with a big window viewed from the side as well as a longer-range aerial view - the latter is useful for dodging hazards to the left or right, as the side-view doesn't demonstrate these accurately. The bike has 3 gears, and you must use a low gear to go uphill. You will need to do wheelies to ensure good landings from the big jumps, and to clear divots in the ground.","popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[36608,34919,28856,19803,16468,23175,40524,59516,28029,55289],"tags":[1,32,268435466,536870969,536872670,1073741827,1073741828],"developers":[3215],"publishers":[3212],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3,4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[57,1758,4157],"themes":[1,32],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":631065600000,"platforms":[63,16,15,26,25],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":26,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":631065600000,"region":1,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/psh0dafms7o5pllxi1qe.jpg","cloudinary_id":"psh0dafms7o5pllxi1qe","width":640,"height":803}}
