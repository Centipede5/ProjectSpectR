It\u00b4s just as silly, although in different ways :D The main character gets transported to an alternate world when he picks up an umbrella, and he has to save it to get home. The game is full of all sorts of cliche plot elements. It's a total camp overload, but it's a still a lot of fun.","popularity":1,"games":[36608,16468,55289,59516,49414,28010,34294,25636,1224,25311],"tags":[1,268435468],"category":0,"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":814924800000,"platforms":[19],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":19,"date":814924800000,"region":8,"human":"1995-Oct-29","y":1995,"m":10}]}
