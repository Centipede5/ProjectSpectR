When they established Wisdom Tree, they repackaged the game twice: in 1991 as Exodus: Journey to the Promised Land and in 1992 as Joshua & The Battle of Jericho, with Joshua labeled a sequel to Exodus. These two versions would be remade for the Sega Mega Drive in 1993 and 1994, respectively. \nThough the games do have a TMSS check, they will only do the $A14000 write if they detect the region of the console they are running on as US \u2014 therefore, the games will only boot on either any US Mega Drive or on any other Model 1 Mega Drive without TMSS (making that a partly useless form of region lockout). \n \nGameplay of both versions is identical: you are the main character (Moses or Joshua, respectively) and you must collect all the bags with M on them (Joshua: coins with $ on them) scattered throughout each maze. A and C shoot; you can hold them down for rapidfire. Shooting destroys blockades and enemies. Once all the M bags are gathered, find the exit to move on to the next level. In between each level, you must answer a bunch of questions related to the story of the Bible of the game's theme; getting them wrong appears to be inconsequential to the outcome of the game (this needs investigation).","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[19222,41348,10225,27266,14246,60044,236,27725,101980,101976],"tags":[268435465],"category":0,"keywords":[534,4155,5416,5418,5436,9711],"themes":[1,17,22,34],"genres":[9],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/adhzfqdhnksdruh3jbdr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"adhzfqdhnksdruh3jbdr","width":370,"height":523}}
