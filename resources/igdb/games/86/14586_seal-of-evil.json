The story of the game picks up several years after a fierce war between the Qin troops and the people of Baivue. Military leader Lan Xiong, who was instrumental in fighting back the Qin, and his wizard, Chi Huan, both die under mysterious circumstances. What or who was behind their deaths? In the role of Lan Wei, Lan Xiong's daughter, players set out on a dangerous adventure into the Central Plains to find out the truth and make her father live again.","storyline":"The Seal of Evil story is set in the twilight years of the Warring States period of Chinese history (476 ? 206 BC). This turbulent time marks the disintegration of the longest lived of all imperial dynasties, the Zhou. Out of the strife and chaos emerges a nobleman possessed of an indomitable spirit and an uncompromising vision of the future: Ying Zheng, ruler of the Qin state. He will stop at nothing to reunite the disparate Chinese kingdoms. Combining ancient legends and mythic storytelling with historical fact, Seal of Evil sets the stage for an epic adventure wherein the players struggle to thwart the Qin invasion of their peaceful homeland, East Baiyue. Ferocious beasts, merciless enemy soldiers, wicked bandits, and terrifying supernatural foes are hazards they must face in order to achieve this goal. There is still hope for them, however, for along the way they will also make many friends and acquire powerful weapons and equipment. And armed with mighty elemental magic, they may yet come face to face with the very Gods themselves","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[36926,12632,22747,26766,47823,25300,17583,36608,16468,36534],"tags":[1,268435468,536871086,536871208,536871422,536871938,536872845,536875057,536875361,536876847,536880264,1073741827],"developers":[2963],"publishers":[146],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[174,296,510,1026,1933,4145,4449,5935,9352],"themes":[1],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1097798400000,"platforms":[6],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1097798400000,"human":"2004-Oct-15","y":2004,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/atxhu1epm3iylmzysv4w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"atxhu1epm3iylmzysv4w","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xlnua3icp2jx8q5neal9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xlnua3icp2jx8q5neal9","width":1024,"height":768},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/gzl4cck0fbs4sjyklvbd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gzl4cck0fbs4sjyklvbd","width":1024,"height":768}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tqk7o4zgxrtya504fbri.jpg","cloudinary_id":"tqk7o4zgxrtya504fbri","width":1280,"height":720}}
