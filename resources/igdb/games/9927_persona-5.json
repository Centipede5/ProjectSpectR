{"id":9927,"name":"Persona 5","slug":"persona-5","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/games\/persona-5","created_at":1430168520169,"updated_at":1541560052141,"summary":"Persona 5 is a role-playing game developed by Atlus. It is chronologically the sixth installment in the Persona series, which is part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. Persona 5 is a role-playing game in which players live out a year in the life of a high school boy who gains the ability to summon facets of his psyche, known as Personas. Dungeon exploration features additional elements from previous iterations, such as jumping across gaps or dashing between cover. Dungeons feature a mixture of fixed environments tied into the plot and theme, and randomly generated environments. Battles are based on a turn-based attack system, with the characters wielding both their Personas and two weapon types: a gun and a melee weapon. The Social Link element from Persona 3 and 4 also returns in an altered form.","storyline":"The story focuses on the 16-year-old protagonist after he is transferred to Syujin High School in Tokyo, Japan. Staying with friends of his parents, he meets up with problem child Ryuji Sakamoto, the withdrawn Ann Takamaki, art student Yusuke Kitagawa, and a talking, shape-shifting cat-like creature known as Morgana. \n \nDuring the protagonist's time there, feeling suppressed by their environment, the five form a group known as the \"Phantom Thieves of Hearts\", working together to explore the \"Palace\", a castle created by the hearts of people, and steal ill intent from others' hearts to help them: during this quest, they confront adult authority figures opposing them, along with a greater enemy revealed by their activities.","collection":552,"franchise":592,"franchises":[592],"hypes":34,"rating":95.8016573091478,"popularity":47,"aggregated_rating":93.5714285714286,"aggregated_rating_count":23,"total_rating":94.6865429402882,"total_rating_count":143,"rating_count":120,"games":[2933,11156,11416,9600,7346,1887,6452,1009,113,11454],"tags":[1,17,23,268435464,268435468,268435487,536870990,536871087,536871127,536871133,536871148,536871208,536871223,536871327,536871421,536871422,536871433,536871470,536871496,536871632,536871937,536871938,536871939,536872078,536872121,536872156,536872201,536872211,536872222,536872225,536872416,536872417,536872425,536872435,536872563,536872647,536872695,536872928,536872957,536872961,536872983,536873017,536873059,536873082,536873096,536873111,536873302,536873311,536873364,536873513,536874343,536874398,536874745,536875006,536875081,536875102,536875151,536875153,536875157,536875196,536875199,536875247,536875250,536875275,536875281,536875309,536875322,536875358,536875380,536875409,536875420,536875437,536875453,536875523,536875590,536875622,536875623,536875680,536875699,536875757,536875762,536875764,536875777,536875795,536875808,536875822,536875830,536875882,536875934,536875941,536876109,536876130,536876176,536876197,536876201,536876226,536876235,536876277,536876287,536876289,536876306,536876307,536876311,536876312,536876332,536876384,536876397,536876490,536876620,536876815,536876875,536876932,536876976,536877029,536877053,536877153,536877373,536877560,536877765,536877768,536877841,536877960,536877991,536877992,536878024,536878209,536878246,536878450,536878452,536878565,536879586,536879715,536879812,536880094,536880136,536880243,536880244,536880276,536880288,536881080,536881463,536882700,536882990,536882994,536882995,536882999,536883004,536883005,536883287,536883468,536884005,536885057,536887630,536889066,536889067,536889068,536889069,1073741826],"developers":[818,9969],"publishers":[818,2488,423],"game_engines":[149],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":432000},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,175,215,221,236,296,311,415,509,510,521,558,584,720,1025,1026,1027,1166,1209,1244,1289,1299,1310,1313,1504,1505,1513,1523,1651,1735,1783,2016,2045,2049,2071,2105,2147,2170,2184,2199,2390,2399,2452,2601,3431,3486,3833,4094,4169,4190,4239,4241,4245,4284,4287,4335,4338,4363,4369,4397,4410,4446,4468,4497,4508,4525,4541,4611,4678,4710,4711,4768,4787,4845,4850,4852,4865,4883,4896,4910,4918,4970,5022,5029,5197,5218,5264,5285,5289,5314,5323,5365,5375,5377,5394,5395,5399,5400,5420,5472,5485,5578,5708,5903,5963,6020,6064,6117,6141,6241,6461,6648,6853,6856,6929,7048,7079,7080,7112,7297,7334,7538,7540,7653,8674,8803,8900,9182,9224,9331,9332,9364,9376,10168,10551,11788,12078,12082,12083,12087,12092,12093,12375,12556,13093,14145,16718,18154,18155,18156,18157],"themes":[1,17,23],"genres":[8,12,31],"first_release_date":1473897600000,"pulse_count":357,"platforms":[9,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1491264000000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Apr-04","y":2017,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1491264000000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Apr-04","y":2017,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1473897600000,"region":5,"human":"2016-Sep-15","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1473897600000,"region":5,"human":"2016-Sep-15","y":2016,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1491264000000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Apr-04","y":2017,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1491264000000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Apr-04","y":2017,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"P5","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Shin

is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a high-school student who enters an alternate world and uses special powers to change the hearts of people in the real world. As players explore themed areas of the \u201cMetaverse,\u201d they engage in turn-based combat against fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, evil spirits, shadow creatures). Characters use blades, pipes, firearms, and Personas (i.e., creatures that enable magical attacks) to defeat enemies; battles are highlighted by light effects, impact sounds, and cries of pain. Some cutscenes depict characters ripping masks off their faces as blood sprays. One cutscene depicts a man shooting another character in the head at close range; blood is shown pooling on the floor and splattering the victim's clothes. Several female monsters\/Personas are depicted with exposed breasts, and a handful of creatures have phallic-shaped heads, torsos, or appendages. Various Personas (e.g., Succubus, Incubus) have sexual characteristics that are described in text (e.g., \u201cThey visit sleeping men\/women and have sexual intercourse with them\u201d); dialogue also includes sexual references (e.g., \u201cApparently he's been forcing young idols and other girls to have sex with him to move up in the ranks\u201d). Drug smuggling for the mafia is briefly discussed during a side quest (e.g., \u201cLike illegal drugs\u2026? Maybe they made Iida smuggle drugs for them.\u201d).
