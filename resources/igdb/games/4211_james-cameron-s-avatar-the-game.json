You've been hand-picked for the Avatar Program, a science initiative launched by the RDA Corporation. You're here to pilot your own Avatar, a hybrid of your DNA and that of Pandora's indigenous species, the Na'vi. As you explore the Pandoran jungle, you'll learn more about the creatures of Pandora, the Na'vi, and their struggle to stop the RDA. At the flashpoint of a growing conflict, you must decide where your true allegiance lies. Do you fight alongside the RDA in a conflict spiralling out of control? Or do you join the Na'vi and battle to protect Pandora from the onslaught of an invading force?","collection":4282,"franchise":272,"franchises":[272],"rating":74.5401186734442,"popularity":3.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":60.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":67.60339267005546,"total_rating_count":27,"rating_count":18,"games":[55038,36950,28309,55092,25300,2807,22387,36198,18290,37777],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435487,536870915,536871079,536871208,536871303,536871882,536871904,536871937,536871938,536871939,536871945,536872070,536872205,536872352,536872883,536873364,536873379,536874831,536875046,536875054,536875257,536875271,536875294,536875424,536875492,536875693,536875753,536875762,536875889,536875910,536876299,536876507,536876569,536876695,536876821,536877275,536877679,536877992,536878117,536878279,536879827,536879937,536881523,536882380,536882386,536883352,536883634,536883865,536883899,536883980,536892144,536892145,1073741826],"developers":[38],"publishers":[104,2096,2097,61],"game_engines":[118,17,76],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[3,167,296,391,970,992,1025,1026,1027,1033,1158,1293,1440,1971,2452,2467,3919,4134,4142,4345,4359,4382,4512,4580,4781,4841,4850,4977,4998,5387,5595,5657,5783,5909,6363,6767,7080,7205,7367,8915,9025,10611,11468,11474,12440,12722,12953,12987,13068,21232,21233],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":1259625600000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[34,6,39,9,38,12,20,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1259884800000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Dec-04","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1259884800000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Dec-04","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1259884800000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Dec-04","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1259884800000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Dec-04","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1259884800000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Dec-04","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1259625600000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Dec-01","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1260144000000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-07","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1290643200000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Nov-25","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1259625600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-01","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1259625600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-01","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1259625600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-01","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1259625600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-01","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1259625600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-01","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1260748800000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-14","y":2009,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Avatar","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pwzwujsvfu8rzkwvct5a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pwzwujsvfu8rzkwvct5a","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vdips3gakmlikowlswhf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vdips3gakmlikowlswhf","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/t4w5u1mjx3sj1xxbx2la.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t4w5u1mjx3sj1xxbx2la","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/dvku3tqxkwzosqca67yh.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dvku3tqxkwzosqca67yh","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/x1w7re9nw1pkjtgm03jq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"x1w7re9nw1pkjtgm03jq","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/erve59rnt3zt8yvlcohp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"erve59rnt3zt8yvlcohp","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/xpndkz3e29strrmxdwxy.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xpndkz3e29strrmxdwxy","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/uz8ysi6zfflcrkgzpkzk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"uz8ysi6zfflcrkgzpkzk","width":800,"height":500},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/mzjbdfibrjae21das52v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mzjbdfibrjae21das52v","width":800,"height":495},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pesy4hfbtwodahvalai7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pesy4hfbtwodahvalai7","width":800,"height":500},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/f03xdzb8fm9banqz8hlo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f03xdzb8fm9banqz8hlo","width":800,"height":500},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/pgycz2qmdzklajootbt9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pgycz2qmdzklajootbt9","width":800,"height":500}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ar3pvrpwcul8tytfsee1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ar3pvrpwcul8tytfsee1","width":640,"height":797},"esrb":{"synopsis":"Humans have found a precious metal that they want to extract from the fictional planet Pandora; indigenous alien warriors\u2014blue-skinned \"Na'vi\"\u2014have rallied against mining the planet, for they believe it will lead to destruction, death. Conflict ensues, as players choose to fight as either a human soldier or a Nav'i warrior in this third-person action adventure game. In the role of an RDA Corporation soldier, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, \"shockwave\" bombs, and military vehicles to kill defending Na'vi forces. This military-style combat represents the strongest violent content in the game: realistic artillery sounds, rapid-fire turrets (mounted on platforms), loud and bright explosions, muzzle-flash effects\u2014these elements have the most impact. In the role of a Na'vi warrior, players use dual-wielding axes, long staffs, and bow and arrows to kill invading RDA soldiers. This melee-style combat can be frenetic as well: players \"hack-and-slash\" enemy soldiers at a constant rate, causing them to get knocked back or disappear in a puff of blue mist. The mist effect is most prominent when native animals or the Na'vi get hit\u2014larger, fluid-like spurts are emitted; for example, in one cutscene, the blue hydraulic-like substance sputters out of a Na'vi avatar struck down by an arrow (in slow motion). During the course of the game, characters sometimes use the expletives \"b*tch\" and \"bastard\" in dialogue; they also make a handful of jokes that are suggestive\/sexual in nature (e.g., \"Like the clap. Officer Midori's waiting for you near the main gate\" and \"I was in Singapore with this fine ho*ker and . . . incredible . . . that's what she said.\").
