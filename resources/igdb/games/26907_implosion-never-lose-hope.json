The time has come to justify our existence. A mysterious life form known as the XADA squares off against humanity's last weapon - the War-Mech series III battle suit.","storyline":"\"In late 2170\u2019s, the human race began searching for potential ways to leave their home and travel to an Earth similar planet, as resources were becoming dangerously scarce. \n \nA group of scientists developed Quantum drive tunnelling to achieve interstellar travel. During its testing phase, the \u201clights\u201d from the Quantum drive were detected from billions of miles away by an entity, dubbed \u201cXADA\u201d. XADA attacked the Earth in late 2080. The human race did their best to develop countermeasure technology, namely, the Warmech program. \n \nThe war lasted two years, and by its mid-way point, two nations were left on the planet, Thandeous and Adrillia. Adrillia, in a last ditch effort, cracked Quantum drive signature and fled to a new home in the Tau Ceti group, 12 light years away. Thandeous were the second to flee, and forced to settle on a harsh moon by Adrillia, as the planet could not suitably sustain both races. \n \nThe Ivonix, were the last surviving race. A technologically advanced people, whom survived the War within their orbiting artificial habitat - The Nightstar. They were the last to migrate, and left behind Stealth-X buoys, which would respond to Xada activity on Earth if the Xada ever made a move. \n \nIn 2201, the S-X buoys have picked up a Xada signal from Earth and made a Q-Leap to inform the Nightstar. Simultaneously, a mysterious rift has been detected within the Tau system, signifying a direct transmission attack pathway from Earth. The Ivonix have sent Jake Carloway, and Diana May, aboard the Nightwing attack-shuttle. They carry with them, two of the most deadly WM-3 battle suits in existence. They must return to Earth, and put an end to the XADA, before the human race is eradicated. \n \nAnd now, the IMPLOSION begins....\"","hypes":1,"rating":75,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":75,"total_rating_count":1,"rating_count":1,"games":[68287,27011,55038,28029,36950,25300,17130,86477,306,25311],"tags":[1,18,536871301,536871882,1073741827,1073741826],"developers":[12017],"publishers":[6957,12017],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[103,389,970],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[12,25],"first_release_date":1428451200000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[34,39,130],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":34,"date":1428451200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Apr-08","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1428451200000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Apr-08","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1499299200000,"region":1,"human":"2017-Jul-06","y":2017,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1499299200000,"region":5,"human":"2017-Jul-06","y":2017,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":130,"date":1499299200000,"region":2,"human":"2017-Jul-06","y":2017,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Implosion","comment":"Other"},{"name":"\u30a4\u30f3\u30d7\u30ed\u30fc\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/o1tjywjpaojug1dvbify.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o1tjywjpaojug1dvbify","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ep5qjmsoyyf51ld1couf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ep5qjmsoyyf51ld1couf","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ptmaghsz0m5l4erw1evv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ptmaghsz0m5l4erw1evv","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vyhdz1cwto2boy2mtnfc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vyhdz1cwto2boy2mtnfc","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/rofd343kfblubqvkhpec.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rofd343kfblubqvkhpec","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/wl4hidsabl4nqo0v8ohq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wl4hidsabl4nqo0v8ohq","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/nwfoytujtgizrshfojtz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nwfoytujtgizrshfojtz","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/qsb5bhrsanevw3t0uwfk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qsb5bhrsanevw3t0uwfk","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/hykdan1lpkq5fzgmtrqw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hykdan1lpkq5fzgmtrqw","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/awmzevxdj5xm623lnemt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"awmzevxdj5xm623lnemt","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ois6jxhrjz539dqlfchr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ois6jxhrjz539dqlfchr","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"VoPxgHqioco"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ImXjPmpXVSo"},{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"ZqjLRIpB14k"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"11a_9ymMWAI"}],"cover":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/krkasjwwg3unq2i0bhce.jpg","cloudinary_id":"krkasjwwg3unq2i0bhce","width":1000,"height":1000},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":12,"url":"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store\/apps\/details?id=com.rayark.implosion"},{"category":11,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/true\/id870322730?platform=ipad"},{"category":10,"url":"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/true\/id870322730?platform=iphone"},{"category":3,"url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Implosion_-_Never_Lose_Hope"},{"category":1,"url":"https:\/\/www.rayark.com\/g\/implosion\/"}]}
