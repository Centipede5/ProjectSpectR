Set in the so-called town of Lor, this is a comical, satirical, and absurd look at the modern antagonism towards government; and of course an exploration of the virtues of the humble lychee fruit. \n \nGonna tell you all a story 'bout a man named Dwight \nin the town of Lor so raggedy blue \nThe town of Lor, it ain't got no living man \nOh no, not anymore \nOh! From the highways to the byways we all can't settle down \nEllie was just a child in the blue town blue \nborn under a black and amber sun \nthe saloon once spun its wheels; we went charging up the hills \nand left her standing there all alone \nOh, gotta sing about the curse of the man: Dwight Periwinkle! \n \nThe town of Lor: it was once ruled by a king. Or was it a tyrant? Either way, he's gone away. Or is he coming back? An independent Lor or monarchy? Enter Dwight: a wisecracking layabout. Give him some food, and a membership into the Flanarchy Society (yes, they have flans). What could go wrong? Enter Amy Voight, a reporter decidedly on the side of the king. She's going to say what she thinks regardless, and she thinks the king was a good king, and that he's coming back. Enter Ellie, a (slightly) hyperactive child who doesn't care, and wants lychees. She will find lychees. ALL THE LYCHEES!","storyline":"The town of Lor: it was once ruled by a king. Or was it a tyrant? Either way, he's gone away. Or is he coming back?
