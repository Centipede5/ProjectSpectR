It was not particularly useful for business applications, but was well-received for the many games available. It was also the first relatively inexpensive colour computer, costing less than $300. It is the predecessor of the significantly more well known Commodore 64, which is the highest selling single computer model of all time.","manufacturers":[{"company":4639}],"developers":[{"company":4639}],"logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/vwwvricrqgqefcgugo2b.png","cloudinary_id":"vwwvricrqgqefcgugo2b","width":3218,"height":1607}}]}
