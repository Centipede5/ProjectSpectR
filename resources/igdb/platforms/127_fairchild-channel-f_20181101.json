It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridge\u2013based video game console, and the first console to use a microprocessor. It was launched as the Video Entertainment System, or VES, but when Atari released their VCS the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine. By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units and trailed behind the VCS.","cpu":"Fairchild F8 at 1.79MHz","memory":"64 bytes","graphics":"8 colors (either black\/white or four color max. per line)","sound":"120 Hz, 500 Hz and 1 kHz beeps (can be modulated to produce different tones)","media":"2 kB VRAM Cartridges","resolutions":"128x64 pixels","output":"RF modulated composite video signal, cord hardwired to console","manufacturers":[{"company":9372}],"developers":[{"company":9372}],"logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/duyanq8irykcunpz1uwq.png","cloudinary_id":"duyanq8irykcunpz1uwq","width":1024,"height":674},"release_dates":[{"date":252374400000,"region":1},{"date":215654400000,"region":2}]},{"name":"Saba Videoplay","slug":"saba-videoplay","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/platforms\/fairchild-channel-f\/version\/saba-videoplay","summary":"Saba Videoplay was the licensed Channel F-Version for the German market. It was released in late 1977 and was positively received by the press and the general public. However, the initial retail price of over 500 DM meant that the Videoplay would be available only to higher-income households. Yet, the system sold reasonably well, offering a library of 18 games by the end of 1978. But as competition started to grow larger, the inferiority of the Fairchild-hardware became more and more obvious. By 1980 Saba dropped the hardware, which was now owned by Zircon, who licenced it to other German competitors, namely ITT and Nordmende.","logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/lm8dcilyltp3metaixtl.png","cloudinary_id":"lm8dcilyltp3metaixtl","width":400,"height":377},"release_dates":[{"date":252374400000}]}]}
