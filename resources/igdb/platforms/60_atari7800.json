The console was Atari's attempt to compete with the NES and Sega Master System. Following a massive research project focused on determining exactly what consumers were demanding from a video game platform, Atari knew what it needed for its next generation system. They selected the General Computer Corporation to design new a graphics chip. \"Marie\" was what they named it. It provided a greater spectrum of colors and an endless number of sprites.\n\nThere was also one extra feature Atari added to the Marie chip. In an effort to combat third-party game manufacturers from taking a huge chunk out of their potential software profits, Atari installed an encryption algorithm (like a coded lock) into the Marie Chip. The 7800 would only allow cartridges containing a 960-bit encoded \"key\" to activate its state-of-the-art graphics and sound capabilities. If a cartridge did not include the proper coded authentication, the system remained in its default mode and could only run games made for the 2600.\n\nWith the 7800, Atari attempted to correct all of the shortcomings inherent to the 5200 platform. As stated above, the 7800 was compatible with 2600 cartridges. They had even designed an adapter (later discarded upon release) which would let the 7800 play 5200 cartridges, giving Atari across-the-board compatibility with all previous software. To make the system even more attractive to consumers considering purchasing a home computer, Atari promised an optional keyboard add-on.\n\nWhile size of the 7800 console is much smaller than the immense 5200, the major improvement was made in the joystick design. The 7800 controller was made more in the tradition of the 2600. It is sleek, simple and, most importantly, durable.\n\nIn 1983, the Marie project was a courageous attempt to bring Atari back as the preeminent name in video games. Atari poured their best available personnel into the project. The system was ready and waiting to ignite the stagnant video game market.\n\nUnfortunately timing was working against the proponents of the 7800. In 1984, Warner Communications sold Atari to Jack Tramiel. He wanted to focus on the company's computer line, and the Atari 7800 was shelved.\n\nThe video game market awoke with a roar in 1985. Nintendo had released the NES game system to American consumers. Videogame sales skyrocketed and soon Sega premiered its Sega Master System. Seeing there was money to be made, Atari scrambled to get onto the playing field and released the Atari 7800 in 1986 with only three games: Ms. Pac-Man, Joust and Asteroids.\n\nWith a paltry $300,000 advertising budget Atari gave the system a half-hearted release. Sales for the platform were good, but Atari was also trying to market a computer\/console hybrid called the Atari XE and a remodeled version of the Atari 2600. All three platforms remained far behind Nintendo and Sega's offerings. By the time the Atari 7800 started to build up a substantial library of games, it was too late, and the system disappeared from store shelves.","cpu":"Atari SALLY 6502 @ 1,19-1,79 MHz","storage":"4KB BIOS Rom, 48KB Cartridge ROM","memory":"4KB RAM","media":"ROM cartridge","resolutions":"160x240, 320x240","output":"S-Video","manufacturers":[{"company":2406},{"company":190}],"logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/npw176njifbv61tt2ecj.png","cloudinary_id":"npw176njifbv61tt2ecj","width":360,"height":140},"release_dates":[{"date":456019200000,"region":2}]}]}
