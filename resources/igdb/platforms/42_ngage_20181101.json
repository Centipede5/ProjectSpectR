It was known to be clumsy to hold and also a big pain to insert games into because of you having to remove the back cover and battery before you could insert the game disc. Another clumsy feature was the way the microphone and speaker was situated on the edge of the phone, many described this as talking into a ''Taco phone''.","os":"Symbian OS 6.1 (Series 60)","cpu":"ARM 920T @ 104 MHz","storage":"MMC, 3.4 MB Internal memory","online":"N-Gage Arena","media":"MMC","connectivity":"HSCSD, GPRS, Bluetooth","manufacturers":[{"company":2421}],"developers":[{"company":2421}],"logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/ubqhez6we5all7bzrthp.png","cloudinary_id":"ubqhez6we5all7bzrthp","width":2306,"height":588},"release_dates":[{"date":1065484800000,"region":8}]}]}
