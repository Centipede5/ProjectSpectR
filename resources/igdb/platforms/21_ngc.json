The system was officially released only in Japan. A feature of its main competitors Xbox and PlayStation 2, the GameCube lacked commercial DVD movie playback functionality due to the use of the Nintendo optical disc format for games and the correspondingly small disc tray.","manufacturers":[{"company":2420},{"company":70}],"developers":[{"company":70}],"logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/jtbbevwj5l6q01pkkned.png","cloudinary_id":"jtbbevwj5l6q01pkkned","width":1600,"height":966},"release_dates":[{"date":1008201600000,"region":5}]},{"name":"Initial version","slug":"initial-version-87dfdafa-bcbc-466c-8286-cc8cccf4daa3","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/platforms\/ngc\/version\/initial-version-87dfdafa-bcbc-466c-8286-cc8cccf4daa3","summary":"The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs for its primary storage medium. The discs are similar to the miniDVD format, and as a result of their smaller size, the system was not designed to play standard DVDs or audio CDs. Nintendo presents a variety of connectivity options for the GameCube. It supports online gaming for a small number of games via the broadband or modem adapter, sold separately; it also connects to the Game Boy Advance, allowing players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second screen and controller.\n\nContemporary reception of the GameCube was generally positive. Some praised the extensive software library and high-quality games, while others criticized the console's exterior design and lack of features. Nintendo sold 21.74 million GameCube units worldwide before being discontinued in 2007. Its successor, the Wii, was released in November 2006.","cpu":"IBM PowerPC ''Gekko'' @ 485 MHz","storage":"Nintendo GameCube Memory Card (8MB-16MB Capacity)","memory":"24MB","graphics":"ATI ''Flipper'' @ 162 MHz","sound":"64 ADPCM channels, analog stereo w\/ Dolby Pro Logic II (Dolby Surround)","online":"Various game-specific services","media":"Nintendo GameCube game disc","connectivity":"Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter","resolutions":"240i, 240p (no games use these), 480i, 480p (only some games support 480p)","output":"Composite, S-Video, YPbPr component, RGB component (Japan only)","manufacturers":[{"company":10356}],"logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/trer7p3e8p6hpmb8nbjt.png","cloudinary_id":"trer7p3e8p6hpmb8nbjt","width":500,"height":500},"release_dates":[{"date":1000425600000,"region":5},{"date":1006041600000,"region":2},{"date":1021593600000,"region":3},{"date":1020384000000,"region":1}]}]}
