In PAL regions, the 250 GB model is not available; a model with 12 GB of flash memory is available in its place. A standalone 250 GB hard drive is available to upgrade this model. Both are roughly 25% smaller and about 20% lighter than the original PS3 Slim. This version has a sliding disc cover rather than the slot-loading drive found on previous PlayStation 3 consoles. A vertical stand is also available for these models and was launched on the same day as the consoles in their respective regions.","manufacturers":[{"company":2405},{"company":2123}],"developers":[{"company":45}],"logo":{"url":"\/\/images.igdb.com\/igdb\/image\/upload\/t_thumb\/tuyy1nrqodtmbqajp4jg.png","cloudinary_id":"tuyy1nrqodtmbqajp4jg","width":640,"height":269},"release_dates":[{"date":1349308800000,"region":5},{"date":1348531200000,"region":2},{"date":1348790400000,"region":1},{"date":1348704000000,"region":3}]},{"name":"Playstation 3 Slim","slug":"playstation-3-slim","url":"https:\/\/www.igdb.com\/platforms\/ps3\/version\/playstation-3-slim","summary":"Released in 2009 as an slimmer, quieter and re-designet version of the PS3.
