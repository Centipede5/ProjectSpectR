As players manage resources, research weapon technology, and monitor alien presence, they can dispatch squads of soldiers to attack human- and insect-like creatures in turn-based combat. From a 3/4-top-down perspective, players use assault rifles, grenades, and other military-grade weapons to kill nearby enemies. Battles are accompanied by intermittent cutscenes that depict close-up (e.g., over-the-shoulder) instances of violence: soldiers getting impaled or beaten to death by alien creatures; realistic explosions that result in larger blood sprays. If an alien “implants” an egg into a dead human, the character will eventually explode amid additional gibbing effects. Some scenes depict dead or dying soldiers whose bodies are burned or mutilated. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":11,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcom-enemy-within/id881270303?mt=8&uo=4"},{"category":10,"url":"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcom-enemy-within/id881270303?mt=8"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_h2l2T4FrJzfdMF6RbOrcQ"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/225340"},{"category":12,"url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tt2kgames.xcomew"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM:_Enemy_Within"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.xcom.com/enemywithin/"}]},{"id":9740,"name":"Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut","slug":"deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut","created_at":1429026688086,"updated_at":1537649257523,"summary":"Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut was released on October 22, 2013 for Xbox 360, PS3, PC and Wii U.

It also features an improved visual engine and a complete overhaul of the boss battles.","storyline":"On the eve of unveiling a new type of augmentation that will negate the use of Neuropozyne, Sarif Industries is attacked by the Tyrants. Adam Jensen attempts to save Megan Reed and her fellow scientists, but Tyrant leader Namir critically wounds him and apparently kills Megan and the scientists. David Sarif uses his most advanced technology to save Adam, giving him superhuman abilities: he also learns that the augmentations are bonding to him naturally without the need for Neuropozyne. Called back to deal with an attack on a Sarif Industries warehouse by anti-augmentation extremists, Adam discovers an augmented hacker attempting to gain access to the secret Typhoon weapon augmentation. Upon discovery, the hacker is forced by their controller to shoot himself. After Adam retrieves the deceased hacker's neural hub from his old Detroit police precinct, Frank Pritchard tracks the hacking signal to an abandoned factory in Highland Park. Adam discovers the Tyrants guarding a FEMA detention camp, but they are moving out after the failure of the Sarif raid. Adam confronts and defeats one of the mercenaries, Barrett, who tells him to go to Hengsha before killing himself with a grenade. \n \nTogether with pilot Faridah Malik, Adam travels to Hengsha and tracks down the hacker, Arie van Bruggen, who is being both hunted by private security company Belltower Associates and hidden by local triad leader Tong Si Hung. Van Bruggen directs Adam to find evidence inside Tai Yong Medical, the world's largest augmentation technology manufacturer and Sarif's main rival. Infiltrating Tai Yong, Adam finds footage of a call between Namir and Zhao Yun Ru, which confirms that Megan and the other missing scientists are alive and that Eliza Cassan is somehow involved. Confronting Zhao in her penthouse apartment, he learns that she is allied to a powerful organization that controls global interests before she triggers security and forces him to leave. Traveling to the Picus corporate building in Montreal, Jensen tracks down Eliza, revealed to be an artificial intelligence construct designed to influence the media. Despite her programming, she has begun to question her role and offers to help Adam. After he defeats Tyrant member Fedorova, Eliza gives him footage directing him to Doctor Isaias Sandoval, aide to William Taggart. \n \nBack in Detroit, Sarif admits to Adam that the Illuminati are behind the attacks. Adam infiltrates a Humanity Front rally and discovers Sandoval's location. Sandoval admits his involvement in the kidnapping and gives Adam the lead to find the researchers. Back in Sarif HQ, Adam meets Hugh Darrow, who is currently working to stave off global warming with the newly constructed Panchaea Facility in the Arctic. Adam, along with other augmented people, also start experiencing painful glitches, with authorities urging them to have a biochip replacement. Pritchard locates the tracking beacon of one of the scientists, taking Adam back to Hengsha, where he and Malik are ambushed by Belltower. The beacon leads Adam to Tong Si Hung, who has just been implanted with the now-deceased scientist's arm. Under Tong's direction, Adam manages to stow away in a stasis pod in the wake of a staged explosion, waking up a few days later in a secret Singapore base. He finds the kidnapped scientists, and learns that the biochip malfunctions were staged to distribute the result of their research: a new biochip to control augmented humans. Adam and the scientists stage a distraction, allowing him to infiltrate the facility's secret bunker. Here he faces Namir one last time, then finds Megan. Confronted, Megan tells him that she was kidnapped for her research; the genetic key to make all humans compatible with augmentations, which she found in Adam's DNA — and to help Darrow foil the Illuminati's plans. \n \nMoments later, Darrow appears live on television and broadcasts a modified signal that throws any augmented person with the new biochip into a fear-driven, murderous frenzy. Jensen evacuates the scientists, and commandeers an orbital flight module to reach Panchaea. He confronts Darrow, who reveals that he wants humanity to abandon the augmentation technology he invented, because he believes it will destroy human identity. Adam sets out to disable Panchaea's Hyron Project supercomputer and end the broadcast; on the way, he encounters Taggart and Sarif, who each urge him to side with them and further their own agendas. At the heart of Panchaea, Jensen first confronts Zhao Yun Ru when she tries to hijack the signal for her own use; then Eliza, who offers Jensen four choices. Jensen can either broadcast the full truth and distance humanity from augmentations; rig the broadcast so it throws suspicion on the Humanity Front and allows further development of augmentation technology; send out a report blaming the incident on contaminated Neuropozyne so Taggart's group and by extension the Illuminati find new support; or destroy Panchea, leaving no-one to \"spin the story\". Depending on the choice and whether Jensen has taken a pacifist or violent approach through the game, his final narration varies. \n \nIn a post-credits scene, Megan meets with Bob Page, the main antagonist of Deus Ex, to discuss her employment in \"the nanite virus chimera\" and \"D project\": prior to this, Page instructs his cohort Morgan Everett to search the Hyron Project for salvageable technology for the 'Morpheus Initiative': these are the precursors to the creation of the Denton clones, the manufactured nanotechnological \"Gray Death\" virus and the \"Helios\" artificial

is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of Adam Jensen, an ex-cop who must uncover the truth behind a cybernetics company's attack. Players complete mission-based objectives to increase their character's skills (e.g., stealth, strength) and advance the main storyline. Players use pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and explosives to kill a variety of human enemies (e.g., soldiers, police officers, gang members, drug dealers). Players can also use stealth attacks (e.g., choking, electrocution) to dispatch enemies at close range. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, explosions, and large sprays of blood that stain the surrounding environment. Players can sometimes make choices that result in the death of innocent characters: during one sequence, an injured man asks to be “put out of his misery”—the main character can then administer a morphine overdose. Civilians can also be killed directly, though this may negatively affect players' progress. As the game progresses, alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer, vodka, cocktails) can be purchased and consumed to reduce damage, resulting in a screen-blurring effect. In one mission, players can plant “illegal drugs” in a character's residence; marijuana products (i.e., “cigaweed”) are occasionally referenced in the dialogue. Some missions contain sexual material: dialogue involving prostitution (e.g., “They want me to get augmentations . . . for the customer's pleasure. It's sick”; “[W]e can find a quiet spot . . . Do you have enough money for me, sexy?”); an in-game email referencing “pornographic images” and bestiality. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.deusex.com/"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/deusex"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/deusex"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/238010"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Human_Revolution"},{"category":2,"url":"http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Human_Revolution_-_Director's_Cut"}],"external":{"steam":"238010"}},{"id":1555,"name":"Virtua Fighter 5","slug":"virtua-fighter-5","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/virtua-fighter-5","created_at":1349898235147,"updated_at":1528347220325,"summary":"Virtua Fighter 5 features an all-star cast of 17 fighters, including characters from the previous iterations along with two new characters named El Blaze and Eileen. El Blaze is a Mexican fighting champion who defeats opponents with his quick Lucha Libre fighting style. Eileen, originally from China, uses a Monkey Kung-Fu fighting style that she learned from her grandfather, a former Kung-Fu master. \n \nPlayers are able to customize their characters by selecting from four uniquely patterned costumes and a wide range of attachable items that can be placed onto each fighter’s various body parts. Virtua Fighter 5 delivers fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action as players head into battle, taking on a host of popular characters. Players not only achieve victory by defeating highly-skilled opponents, but also by competing for prizes which earn them in-game money allowing them to buy many items at in-game shop.

Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power. \n \nThe game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron. \n \nThough the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities.

this third-person shooter, players assume the role of Max Payne, an NYPD detective-turned-bodyguard for a wealthy Brazilian family. As the noir–style storyline unfolds, players use machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and explosives to kill human adversaries (e.g., armed thugs, gang members, paramilitary units) in frenetic combat. Slow-motion effects (i.e., “bullet time”) can be utilized for improved targeting precision, and killing certain enemies triggers a zoomed-in “bullet cam” (close-ups of entry/exit wounds/headshots). Frantic screaming and realistic gunfire occur throughout, and characters emit large blood-splatter effects when hit; some explosions (in gameplay and cutscenes) result in dismembered limbs or bloodstained surroundings. Non-adversaries—if unrelated to the storyline—can be killed without consequence, and dead bodies may incur additional damage. A variety of cutscenes (some interactive) include more intense acts of violence: a hostage getting shot at point-blank range; a man getting doused with gasoline and set on fire; an injured, bleeding enemy crying out during an interrogation. During the course of the game, Max visits a strip club that depicts topless pole dancers. As he enters the club, fleeting sexual activity can be observed in the background: a partially nude prostitute sitting on top of a man; a character thrusting against a woman, whose body is partially obscured by two onlookers. The game sometimes references or portrays illegal substances (e.g., a “drug den” with bags of white powder scattered across a counter); in a couple of sequences, characters are depicted snorting cocaine. Alcoholism is a significant component of Max's character, and several cutscenes portray him drinking heavily and/or stumbling amid blurred screen effects. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“c*cksucker,”“c*nt,”“sp*c,” and “n*gga” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.rockstargames.com/maxpayne3"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/maxpayne3"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne_3"},{"category":2,"url":"http://maxpayne.wikia.com/wiki/Max_Payne_3"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/204100"}],"external":{"steam":"204100"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":620,"name":"Burnout Paradise","slug":"burnout-paradise","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/burnout-paradise","created_at":1317745816000,"updated_at":1540103405041,"summary":"Evolve or die.

all.","collection":515,"rating":81.5959896336223,"popularity":3.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":93.0,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":87.29799481681115,"total_rating_count":227,"rating_count":221,"games":[98,19441,99,97,2626,2033,1121,1020,1979,40],"tags":[1,33,38,268435466,536870937,536870969,536871033,536871067,536871072,536871313,536871396,536871647,536871690,536872010,536872070,536872205,536872211,536872245,536872315,536872321,536872333,536872352,536872371,536872415,536872511,536872587,536872590,536872695,536873053,536873064,536873350,536873351,536873364,536873390,536873425,536873455,536873753,536874337,536874539,536874706,536874813,536874824,536874906,536875046,536875047,536875057,536875058,536875059,536875069,536875073,536875081,536875095,536875098,536875117,536875125,536875133,536875154,536875157,536875194,536875197,536875199,536875200,536875229,536875254,536875271,536875276,536875286,536875312,536875330,536875344,536875364,536875387,536875396,536875413,536875432,536875440,536875456,536875464,536875480,536875490,536875501,536875511,536875523,536875536,536875542,536875545,536875638,536875649,536875650,536875709,536875715,536875743,536875744,536875745,536875764,536875781,536875792,536875802,536875809,536875822,536875896,536875937,536875951,536875957,536876029,536876073,536876108,536876190,536876191,536876199,536876214,536876274,536876281,536876287,536876314,536876333,536876335,536876386,536876419,536876435,536876466,536876474,536876502,536876514,536876521,536876545,536876552,536876574,536876666,536876695,536876699,536876703,536876727,536876759,536876762,536876811,536876821,536876891,536876919,536876921,536876948,536876972,536877038,536877039,536877099,536877108,536877176,536877179,536877181,536877223,536877318,536877363,536877414,536877498,536877517,536877677,536877696,536877742,536877938,536877948,536877953,536877982,536877983,536877994,536877998,536878133,536878255,536878277,536878544,536879055,536879133,536879167,536879193,536879891,536879936,536880084,536880134,536880355,536880380,536880441,536880481,536881123,536881347,536881348,536881349,536881481,536881679,536881831,536882021,536882159,536882168,536882190,536882450,536882469,536882645,536882666,536882667,536883035,536883074,536883623,536883815,536883865,536883995,536884430,536884507,536884853,536885520,536887224,536890529,536891859,536893395,536893396,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[347],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[41],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[25,57,121,155,160,401,484,735,778,1098,1158,1293,1299,1333,1403,1409,1421,1440,1459,1503,1599,1675,1678,1783,2141,2152,2438,2439,2452,2478,2513,2543,2841,3425,3627,3794,3901,3912,3994,4134,4135,4145,4146,4147,4157,4161,4169,4183,4186,4205,4213,4221,4242,4245,4282,4285,4287,4288,4317,4342,4359,4364,4374,4400,4418,4432,4452,4475,4484,4501,4520,4528,4544,4552,4568,4578,4589,4599,4611,4624,4630,4633,4726,4737,4738,4797,4803,4831,4832,4833,4852,4869,4880,4890,4897,4910,4984,5025,5039,5045,5117,5161,5196,5278,5279,5287,5302,5362,5369,5375,5402,5421,5423,5474,5507,5523,5554,5562,5590,5602,5609,5633,5640,5662,5754,5783,5787,5791,5815,5847,5850,5899,5909,5979,6007,6009,6036,6060,6126,6127,6187,6196,6264,6267,6269,6311,6406,6451,6502,6586,6605,6765,6784,6830,7026,7036,7041,7070,7071,7082,7086,7221,7343,7365,7632,8143,8221,8255,8281,8979,9024,9172,9222,9443,9468,9529,9569,10211,10435,10436,10437,10569,10767,10919,11109,11247,11256,11278,11538,11557,11733,11754,11755,12123,12162,12711,12903,12953,13083,13518,13595,13941,14608,16312,19617,20947,22483,22484],"themes":[1,33,38],"genres":[10],"expansions":[23041],"first_release_date":1200960000000,"pulse_count":13,"platforms":[9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1200960000000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Jan-22","y":2008,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1201219200000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Jan-25","y":2008,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1203552000000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Feb-21","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1203552000000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Feb-21","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1202342400000,"region":3,"human":"2008-Feb-07","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1202342400000,"region":3,"human":"2008-Feb-07","y":2008,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1201219200000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Jan-25","y":2008,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1200960000000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Jan-22","y":2008,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Burnout

critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection offers a handful of the most popular Metal Gear Solid titles from the past in true HD for the first time ever. Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The \"Metal Gear Solid (MGS)\" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected.The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.","collection":2128,"franchise":463,"franchises":[463],"hypes":1,"rating":85.0,"popularity":4.333333333333334,"aggregated_rating":88.625,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":86.8125,"total_rating_count":11,"rating_count":1,"games":[103054,375,80916,2933,25076,25311,35371,37777,76397,880],"tags":[1,23,268435471,268435480,268435487,536871475,536871784,536871872,536871945,536872131,536872349,536872451,536872746,536873507,536875194,536875250,536875487,536875638,536875707,536875830,536876068,536876096,536876167,536876219,536876235,536876574,536876970,536877015,536877151,536877252,536877297,536877598,536877986,536878097,536878380,536878502,536878520,536878563,536879212,536879716,536879908,536880235,536880241,536880251,536880714,536880759,536880880,536881267,536882018,536882053,536882445,536892033,536892034,1073741826,1073741825],"developers":[1804,1030,170],"publishers":[129],"category":3,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[563,872,960,1033,1219,1437,1539,1834,2595,4282,4338,4575,4726,4795,4918,5156,5184,5255,5307,5323,5662,6058,6103,6239,6340,6385,6686,7074,7185,7468,7590,7608,7651,8300,8804,8996,9323,9329,9339,9802,9847,9968,10355,11106,11141,11533,21121,21122],"themes":[1,23],"genres":[15,24,31],"first_release_date":1320710400000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[46,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1328227200000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Feb-03","y":2012,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1320883200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Nov-10","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1320710400000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Nov-08","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1341446400000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Jul-05","y":2012,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1340928000000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Jun-29","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1340841600000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Jun-28","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1339459200000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jun-12","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1341446400000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Jul-05","y":2012,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1341446400000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Jul-05","y":2012,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1351900800000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Nov-03","y":2012,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1322006400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Nov-23","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1320710400000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Nov-08","y":2011,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"MGS HD Collection","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/itwrf3rrb6j0whlojvmd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"itwrf3rrb6j0whlojvmd","width":1882,"height":1066},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kphjlxep2itpdnlgph40.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kphjlxep2itpdnlgph40","width":1804,"height":1022},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zszkf0zjq65qfrezu3dm.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zszkf0zjq65qfrezu3dm","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aq1o80feiqpif7bfkysk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aq1o80feiqpif7bfkysk","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fj3yfhtmy5fpbjogzr3y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fj3yfhtmy5fpbjogzr3y","width":480,"height":272}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"1K_l8U61OpA"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pyd6cyskdhsv3hajvfqn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pyd6cyskdhsv3hajvfqn","width":696,"height":729},"esrb":{"rating":6},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid_HD_Collection"},{"category":2,"url":"http://metalgear.wikia.com/wiki/Metal_Gear_Solid:_HD_Collection"}]},{"id":7198,"name":"Super Street Fighter IV","slug":"super-street-fighter-iv","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/super-street-fighter-iv","created_at":1401552684465,"updated_at":1538776321238,"summary":"Super Street Fighter IV is a 2010 fighting game produced by Capcom.

It was released on April 27, 2010 in North America, April 28, 2010 in Japan, and April 30, 2010 in Europe for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.","collection":2885,"franchise":792,"franchises":[792],"rating":70.1146656536508,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":90.4,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":80.2573328268254,"total_rating_count":29,"rating_count":21,"games":[1238,10039,75964,90101,103269,103288,76921,109490,7728,43465],"tags":[268435460,536888127,536888375,536893030,536893031,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[37,396],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[17215,17463,22118,22119],"genres":[4],"first_release_date":1272326400000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1272326400000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Apr-27","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1272326400000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Apr-27","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1272412800000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Apr-28","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1272412800000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Apr-28","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1272585600000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1272585600000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Apr-30","y":2010,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"スーパーストリートファイター IV","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wffjmo3nnjczhf19a437.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wffjmo3nnjczhf19a437","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hvqqhvdz34tqjimxmmix.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hvqqhvdz34tqjimxmmix","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/q6mzmbfwrke2hnno50bn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"q6mzmbfwrke2hnno50bn","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vum9z753cq4ozzgazmot.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vum9z753cq4ozzgazmot","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e6zzt5dm4jlyyt3ylese.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e6zzt5dm4jlyyt3ylese","width":336,"height":310}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oczq6zt6xstpf4qspabs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oczq6zt6xstpf4qspabs","width":219,"height":262},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Street_Fighter_IV"},{"category":2,"url":"http://streetfighter.wikia.com/wiki/Super_Street_Fighter_IV"}]},{"id":15856,"name":"Bionic Commando Rearmed","slug":"bionic-commando-rearmed","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/bionic-commando-rearmed","created_at":1452439249064,"updated_at":1537020600650,"summary":"Classic side-scrolling gameplay is reporting back for duty with Bionic Commando Rearmed, a remake of the classic NES game, out now on PC. 20 years after the 8-bit classic was released, Bionic Commando Rearmed recreates the world of the original with a complete \"2.5D\" visual revamp.","storyline":"Bionic Commando Rearmed borrows its plot largely from the Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game. In keeping with the North American release of that version, the references to the Nazi party found in the original Japanese title are not featured in Rearmed. However, as is the case in the original, the final boss of the game still clearly resembles Adolf Hitler, and is referred to as \"The Leader\". \n \nRearmed centers around two warring factions: the Federation and the Empire. It begins with the Imperial forces discovering classified documents regarding the development of a secret weapon known as the Albatros project, originally started by an organization known as the Badds, but never completed. Killt, Generalissimo of the Empire's forces, decides to complete the project himself. When the Federation learns of the Empire's plot, they send in their national hero, Super Joe to infiltrate the Empire. During his mission, Joe is captured by Imperial forces. The Federation sends in a second operative named Nathan Spencer to rescue Super Joe and assist him in completing his mission. \n \nSpencer traverses several areas, eliminating many Imperial leaders along his way. As he progresses, he finds new technology and travels deeper behind enemy lines. The plot culminates as Super Joe is rescued from the bionic Imperial soldier Gottfried Groeder, and both Spencer and Joe set out to destroy the Albatros project. During the mission, Spencer encounters \"The Leader\", the resurrected head of the Imperial forces. Spencer defeats The Leader, and together with Super Joe destroys the Albatros. The game ends with both heroes hanging onto a helicopter, flying off as the Albatros explodes.","collection":951,"rating":31.2939757620446,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":88.8571428571429,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":60.07555930959376,"total_rating_count":15,"rating_count":7,"games":[6914,4598,2031,495,569,1331,1006,1939,28204,5973],"tags":[1,18,27,39,268435461,268435464,268435489,536870926,536870933,536870969,536871038,536871213,536871262,536871470,536871501,536871510,536871618,536871851,536871882,536871937,536871971,536872010,536872019,536872070,536872120,536872205,536872235,536872288,536872335,536872547,536872622,536872733,536872961,536873021,536873064,536873299,536873810,536873904,536873999,536874209,536874398,536874585,536874743,536874745,536874947,536875046,536875047,536875055,536875073,536875157,536875170,536875194,536875197,536875200,536875201,536875217,536875257,536875258,536875303,536875309,536875310,536875314,536875358,536875372,536875375,536875396,536875420,536875453,536875456,536875464,536875483,536875484,536875491,536875494,536875538,536875610,536875689,536875692,536875702,536875792,536875802,536875815,536875816,536875887,536875921,536875934,536875949,536876028,536876062,536876083,536876357,536876362,536876391,536876395,536876415,536876435,536876487,536876569,536876608,536876685,536876687,536876703,536876755,536876756,536876762,536876852,536876853,536876878,536876936,536876951,536877063,536877064,536877288,536877429,536877530,536877620,536877820,536877828,536878004,536878256,536878276,536878327,536878405,536878467,536878483,536878507,536878550,536879995,536880234,536880294,536880316,536880318,536880713,536880859,536880886,536880968,536881163,536881523,536882122,536882390,536883653,536883903,536883988,536885426,536888127,536893545,536893546,1073741828],"developers":[842],"publishers":[37],"game_engines":[38],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,3,4],"keywords":[14,21,57,126,301,350,558,589,598,706,939,970,1025,1059,1098,1107,1158,1208,1293,1323,1376,1423,1635,1710,1821,2049,2109,2152,2387,2898,2992,3087,3297,3486,3673,3831,3833,4035,4134,4135,4143,4161,4245,4258,4282,4285,4288,4289,4305,4345,4346,4391,4397,4398,4402,4446,4460,4463,4484,4508,4541,4544,4552,4571,4572,4579,4582,4626,4698,4777,4780,4790,4880,4890,4903,4904,4975,5009,5022,5037,5116,5150,5171,5445,5450,5479,5483,5503,5523,5575,5657,5696,5773,5775,5791,5843,5844,5850,5940,5941,5966,6024,6039,6151,6152,6376,6517,6618,6708,6908,6916,7092,7344,7364,7415,7493,7555,7571,7595,7638,9083,9322,9382,9404,9406,9801,9947,9974,10056,10251,10611,11210,11478,12741,12991,13076,14514,17215,22633,22634],"themes":[1,18,27,39],"genres":[5,8,33],"first_release_date":1218585600000,"platforms":[6,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1218758400000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Aug-15","y":2008,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1218672000000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Aug-14","y":2008,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1218585600000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Aug-13","y":2008,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1218585600000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Aug-13","y":2008,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1218672000000,"region":8,"human":"2008-Aug-14","y":2008,"m":8}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"BCR","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jvdtqoizaa6ryoxr05wt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jvdtqoizaa6ryoxr05wt","width":1600,"height":900},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/toa4mbif4s52kniwpqmx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"toa4mbif4s52kniwpqmx","width":1280,"height":740},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lsai7zekgorokbilphhd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lsai7zekgorokbilphhd","width":1280,"height":740},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ctr9ihkmbmndkthzmqfz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ctr9ihkmbmndkthzmqfz","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kc6xzbefbrrvqyumm4a1.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kc6xzbefbrrvqyumm4a1","width":1024,"height":592}],"videos":[{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"CGyIQGt18i4"},{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"MNTUIwvWVow"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"b6-hqzneyuU"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fkm09bvhn1rytbltiwu7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fkm09bvhn1rytbltiwu7","width":219,"height":262},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action-platformer in which players control a bionically-enhanced soldier who battles a tyrant and his army.

Players use the instruments to match notes on the screen, divided in different portions for different instruments, along with the lyrics for the singer who need to match the pitch.","collection":518,"rating":87.03236428502869,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":92.71428571428568,"aggregated_rating_count":9,"total_rating":89.8733249996572,"total_rating_count":33,"rating_count":24,"games":[2685,2629,2669,1285,2695,2691,2672,2671,2670,2674],"tags":[268435463,536871081,536871400,536871577,536871627,536871669,536872205,536872245,536872419,536872964,536872983,536873064,536873065,536873455,536873847,536874906,536875049,536875094,536875123,536875157,536875184,536875217,536875244,536875245,536875257,536875271,536875312,536875314,536875362,536875364,536875380,536875456,536875460,536875486,536875488,536875610,536875611,536875735,536875751,536875766,536875781,536875802,536875822,536875832,536875941,536875943,536876083,536876084,536876100,536876101,536876102,536876171,536876199,536876266,536876348,536876375,536876435,536876527,536876566,536876617,536876703,536876799,536876817,536876948,536877026,536877035,536877108,536877186,536877187,536877393,536877394,536877406,536877513,536877804,536878071,536878193,536878395,536879799,536880134,536880245,536880316,536880815,536881010,536881094,536881357,536881429,536881598,536881621,536882368,536882369,536882370,536883103,536883429,536883461,536883593,536883620,536883660,536883777,536883779,536883813,536883872,536883980,536883988,536883990,536883991,536883992,536884355,536884389,536884853,536885520,536885580,1073741826],"developers":[362,843],"publishers":[1261],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":25200},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[169,488,665,715,757,1293,1333,1507,2052,2071,2152,2153,2543,2935,3994,4137,4182,4211,4245,4272,4305,4332,4333,4345,4359,4400,4402,4450,4452,4468,4544,4548,4574,4576,4698,4699,4823,4839,4854,4869,4890,4910,4920,5029,5031,5171,5172,5188,5189,5190,5259,5287,5354,5436,5463,5523,5615,5654,5705,5791,5887,5905,6036,6114,6123,6196,6274,6275,6481,6482,6494,6601,6892,7159,7281,7483,8887,9222,9333,9404,9903,10098,10182,10445,10517,10686,10709,11456,11457,11458,12191,12517,12549,12681,12708,12748,12865,12867,12901,12960,13068,13076,13078,13079,13080,13443,13477,13941,14608,14668],"genres":[7],"first_release_date":1221350400000,"platforms":[9,12,5,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1240531200000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Apr-24","y":2009,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1229558400000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Dec-18","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1238112000000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Mar-27","y":2009,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1224374400000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Oct-19","y":2008,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1229558400000,"human":"2008-Dec-18","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1221350400000,"human":"2008-Sep-14","y":2008,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1224374400000,"human":"2008-Oct-19","y":2008,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1229558400000,"human":"2008-Dec-18","y":2008,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"RB2","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nugi4jat6uhpexodjlwx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nugi4jat6uhpexodjlwx","width":1589,"height":893},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yk6hznsngruyrza9tfvb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yk6hznsngruyrza9tfvb","width":1113,"height":811},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hpsocqmx9kf1yhbpiqbb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hpsocqmx9kf1yhbpiqbb","width":1243,"height":845},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vgggkx1sm7ykzc0fdlwv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vgggkx1sm7ykzc0fdlwv","width":1109,"height":821},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bixqom4buqliyr9dih1q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bixqom4buqliyr9dih1q","width":1279,"height":875}],"videos":[{"name":"Game intro","video_id":"UbYi3arisw8"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"JSyrFzkN0BM"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fhtfhhokxib7cnwenkl2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fhtfhhokxib7cnwenkl2","width":256,"height":315},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Band_2"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":4,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":47452,"name":"Diablo III: Reaper of Souls -

This is the first title in the series to alter the traditional tagline \"Tactical Espionage Action\" to \"Tactical Espionage Operations\", referring to the base building and mission mechanics of the game. \n \nSet in 1974 in Costa Rica, the game follows the exploits of returning protagonist Big Boss (previously known as Naked Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, now known simply as Snake) as he runs the mercenary unit Militaires Sans Frontières (Soldiers Without Borders). \n \nPeace Walker consists of two primary playing modes: \"Mission\" and \"Mother Base\". \"Mission\" are the actual action sequences of the game, where the player must infiltrate an enemy territory, whereas \"Mother Base\" is a crew managing simulation mode similar to the \"Comrade System\" in Portable Ops. \n \nMissions \nPlayers get to choose which missions to play from the \"Mission Selector\" screen. There are two main types of Missions: Main Ops are the primary story-based missions in which goals are determined by the narrative and must be played in a strict order in order to proceed. Some Main Ops missions include illustrated cutscenes that involve bits of interactivity in order to proceed. Extra Ops are optional side-missions that involve much more elaborate goals ranging from simple target practices to obtaining secret documents. \n \nWhen the player completes a mission, his or her performance is evaluated afterward. A player's score is penalized with a lower rank and reduced heroism for excessive killing and frequently being discovered, whereas players who are stealthy and subdue enemy soldiers non-lethally will be awarded appropriately. Players can replay previously cleared missions for higher ranks. \n \nPlayers can go through missions as Snake or as an MSF soldier (male or female). Some missions will only be available to Snake, and likewise for MSF soldiers. \n \nThe game adopts certain mechanics from Metal Gear Solid 4, such as the ability to move while crouched, the over-the-shoulder shooting view, the CQC system, and the ability to search held-up soldiers. The truck from Portable Ops, where players can bring subdued enemies for recruitment, has been discarded in favor of the Fulton Recovery System, which players attach to subdued soldiers and prisoners. The Wi-Fi recruitment system from Portable Ops has been modified so that instead of tapping the Circle button to obtain a strong enough signal from an access point, the player will have to knockout soldiers using CQC to accept them. The cardboard box used to hide from enemy soldiers is now available in two-man versions called Love Boxes, which have different variants. The Surround Indicator in Portable Ops can also be used only when it is equipped in the item box and players will also develop and use an early version of the Soliton radar system from Metal Gear Solid. The game features the camouflage index system from Snake Eater, but the player does not have the ability to change camouflage uniforms during a mission as the point index will be entirely based on movement, position, and the size of the weapon equipped in the weapon box. The player can also use marking devices to call in artillery strikes or resupply drops. \n \nMovement is done on the analog stick; actions such as co-op actions use the directional-pad; melee actions, which include multiple throws into crowds of enemies, use the R button; and weapons use the L button with the R button. Players will be unable to move or shoot while lying down and while pinned on a wall. The player can set the control system according to that of Portable Ops, Guns of the Patriots, or Capcom's Monster Hunter. \n \nBefore starting a mission, the player can determine his or her character's item and weapon load-out, including the character's uniform. The player's carrying capacity is limited and any excessive items that the player obtains during a mission will be transferred over to Mother Base's inventory. There are four primary types of uniforms that can be worn by the player. \n \nJungle Fatigues — The default uniform for Snake and MSF Soldiers. A balance of stealth, defense, weapons, and inventory. Available in multiple camouflage patterns. \nNaked — A shirtless version of the Jungle Fatigues, players using Naked uniforms move fast at the cost of lower stealth, weaker defense, and fewer items. \nSneaking Suit — Resembles the sneaking suit worn by Snake in Snake Eater and Portable Ops, it allows players to move without generating foot noises and have higher camouflage compared to other suits while moving, but restricts them to five items and six secondary weapons. \nBattle Dress — A heavily armored suit that allows the player to carry a third primary weapon and absorb heavy firepower, but at the cost of a lower item carrying capacity, slower mobility and a lower camouflage index. A variant outfitted with a helmet is also available, which increases the defenses. \n \nMother Base \nThe Mother Base is an abandoned OTEC research platform in the Caribbean that serves as the MSF's headquarters. Aside from managing the combat, medical, intelligence, and technology research teams seen in MPO, the player can assign personnel to the mess hall crew to feed the troops and keep up their morale. Rebellious or injured personnel can be brought to the brig and sickbay, respectively. The player will also have a chance to capture military vehicles that appear in the game as minor boss opponents, such as armored personnel carriers, tanks, and attack helicopters. Up to 350 soldiers can be recruited; excess staff caught in a mission must be discharged and up to 50 vehicles can be captured over the course of the game. \n \nItems and weapons are not procured on-site, but rather they're developed by MSF's R&D division based on blueprints obtained from missions. New items and weapons can only be developed when the player has sufficient GMP and certain MSF divisions have both reached the required level. Once development of an item has been completed, the R&D staff will automatically mass-produce them for the entire army. \n \nOuter Ops is a new game mechanic where players can deploy their combat unit soldiers (with the exception of Snake and other unique characters) and captured vehicles on certain missions against computer opponents. Each assault force codenamed from Alpha to Hotel has eight slots for assigning vehicles or soldiers, who can gain combat bonuses such as additional hit points and Psyche points, and generate income for the team. Depending on the scale of the enemy's firepower, MSF soldiers who are defeated during the battle can either die or be brought to sickbay for treatment. Vehicles that show damage in one mission will still show damage unless they are taken off the front for repairs, while decommissioned vehicles will be stricken from the inventory. \n \nMultiplayer \nThe Comrade System from Portable Ops has been removed in favor of a cooperative play mode called \"Co-Ops\", which allows two players to play most sneaking missions and four players in boss missions. There are several actions that can take place when two players are next to each other. 'Snake-in' allows players to hold on to each other as one player leads the way, also allowing the players to fire on the move. Other co-operative actions include holding up closing doors, performing CPR on fallen comrades, sharing items, and acting as a spotter for other players whose vision is obscured. \n \nVersus Ops are multiplayer matches played over special versions of certain maps. The player has a choice of whether to organize individual or team deathmatches, base capture and quetzal capture missions. Only certain items or weapons unlocked in the single-player campaign can be used in the mode. Each match can gather up to six players with restrictions included, such as life and psyche points not regained and limited time for CPR revivals.","storyline":"Four years after the events of the San Hieronymo incident, Big Boss—who prefers his original title, Snake—and Kaz Miller have established Militaires Sans Frontières, a small mercenary faction, on the Colombian coast. They are approached by Ramon Galvez Mena, a professor at the University of Peace, and his student, Paz Ortega Andrade. Galvez attempts to hire MSF to investigate an army that has discreetly occupied parts of Costa Rica. Snake refuses, identifying Galvez as a KGB agent, but is convinced when Paz plays a recording of The Boss. \n \nWhen Snake arrives in Costa Rica, he begins to suspect that the mystery army has brought nuclear weapons with them. Enlisting the help of the Sandinista Liberation Army, he tracks a shipment to a research facility deep in the mountains. His suspicions are confirmed when he witnesses Hot Coldman, a senior CIA agent, announce his intentions to fire a live nuclear weapon as part of a project code-named \"Peace Walker,\" a fail-deadly nuclear tank. Snake reveals himself to Huey Emmerich, one of Peace Walker's designers, who agrees to help him stop Coldman. \n \nFollowing Huey's instructions, Snake ventures deeper into Costa Rica, searching for Dr. Strangelove, the designer of Peace Walker's artificial intelligence systems. He discovers that Strangelove has based Peace Walker's primary control systems on The Boss' personality. She demands to know whether The Boss genuinely defected to the Soviet Union, or if she died on a mission that was covered up, going so far as to torture Snake for information. \n \nSnake escapes custody and attempts in vain to destroy Peace Walker, a quadrupedal nuclear launch platform. He chases Peace Walker across the Nicaraguan border to an American airbase on the shores of Lake Cocibolca. Discovering that the base has been occupied by Soviet soldiers, Snake infiltrates the facility to confront Coldman. Coldman reveals the purpose of Peace Walker: he believes that nuclear deterrence is a flawed theory, relying on humans to retaliate in the event of a nuclear exchange, whom he believes to be unwilling to destroy their own race. As an impartial artificial intelligence, Peace Walker would guarantee retaliation, and Coldman intends to fire a warhead to prove it. Suddenly, the facility is overrun by Soviet soldiers, led by Galvez, who reveals himself as Vladimir Zadornov. Zadornov intends to hijack Peace Walker for the Soviet Union, but the standoff is broken by the arrival of MSF and the Sandinistas, giving Snake enough time to destroy Peace Walker. \n \nIn the aftermath of the battle, Zadornov is captured and Coldman mortally wounded. In his dying moments, Coldman activates Peace Walker's data uplink, convincing NORAD that the United States is about to be hit by a Soviet nuclear strike. Snake contacts NORAD, and tries to convince them to stand down, but senior members of the armed forces refuse and plan to retaliate. With a nuclear strike imminent, The Boss' personality takes control of Peace Walker's damaged artificial intelligence and drowns Peace Walker in Lake Cocibolca, severing the connection and ending the threat. \n \nSome time later, Zadornov repeatedly escapes from MSF, arousing Snake's suspicions that someone has betrayed them. Paz reveals herself to be the traitor, using Zadornov's escapes to seize control of Metal Gear ZEKE, a walking tank designed by Huey to act as MSF's deterrent against foreign intervention. Acting as an agent of Major Zero—now using the name \"Cipher\"—Paz issues Snake an ultimatum: surrender MSF to Cipher and become his deterrent, or else she will fire a nuclear warhead on America, at which point they will be branded a nuclear-equipped extremist cult, and the world will unite in their pursuit of MSF. Snake prevents the launch by crippling ZEKE, and Paz is thrown into the ocean. In the aftermath, Snake reconciles with his memory of The Boss and accepts the title of Big Boss as he rallies the soldiers of MSF to prepare for a fight for their survival, declaring them to be living in \"Outer Heaven\".","collection":2128,"franchise":463,"franchises":[463],"rating":81.20421105145891,"popularity":3.0,"aggregated_rating":93.25,"aggregated_rating_count":7,"total_rating":87.22710552572946,"total_rating_count":95,"rating_count":88,"games":[379,380,375,1985,378,1009,960,434,2031,545],"tags":[1,17,22,23,268435461,268435471,536870913,536870933,536871006,536871044,536871079,536871133,536871384,536871470,536871474,536871475,536871937,536871945,536872010,536872013,536872131,536872205,536872315,536872352,536872626,536872746,536872873,536872883,536873066,536873249,536873507,536873889,536874743,536875002,536875046,536875058,536875067,536875073,536875081,536875157,536875162,536875171,536875184,536875236,536875242,536875281,536875310,536875322,536875331,536875358,536875407,536875420,536875437,536875453,536875482,536875486,536875501,536875522,536875523,536875527,536875538,536875553,536875556,536875611,536875652,536875695,536875728,536875732,536875755,536875769,536875817,536875818,536875819,536875831,536875868,536875954,536876008,536876068,536876079,536876121,536876126,536876169,536876178,536876187,536876189,536876212,536876219,536876235,536876261,536876323,536876326,536876363,536876365,536876378,536876397,536876398,536876441,536876442,536876490,536876495,536876505,536876521,536876600,536876609,536876701,536876724,536876725,536876735,536876763,536876808,536876812,536876813,536876817,536876901,536876911,536876991,536877025,536877128,536877144,536877149,536877150,536877157,536877158,536877175,536877268,536877274,536877288,536877303,536877338,536877373,536877380,536877452,536877534,536877536,536877558,536877605,536877606,536877625,536877638,536877648,536877700,536877740,536877741,536877782,536877801,536877950,536877953,536877958,536877963,536877967,536877986,536878003,536878004,536878009,536878032,536878247,536878281,536878324,536878331,536878410,536878412,536878427,536878533,536878582,536879042,536879056,536879069,536879087,536879212,536879707,536879715,536879763,536879817,536879827,536879838,536879895,536879934,536879935,536880066,536880068,536880072,536880095,536880134,536880203,536880222,536880234,536880240,536880286,536880360,536880538,536880548,536880610,536880612,536880640,536880707,536880708,536880709,536880714,536880750,536880782,536880785,536880786,536880819,536880825,536880844,536880873,536880920,536881280,536881284,536881285,536881288,536881301,536881590,536882158,536882451,536882470,536882701,536882730,536882875,536883194,536883200,536883203,536883336,536883347,536883354,536883374,536883404,536883863,536883865,536883948,536883994,536884104,536884105,536884106,536884107,536884108,536884109,536884110,536884111,536884112,536884113,536884114,536884115,536887629,536893131,536893132,1073741826],"developers":[170],"publishers":[129],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[1,21,94,132,167,221,472,558,562,563,1025,1033,1098,1101,1219,1293,1403,1440,1714,1834,1961,1971,2154,2337,2595,2977,3831,4090,4134,4146,4155,4161,4169,4245,4250,4259,4272,4324,4330,4369,4398,4410,4419,4446,4495,4508,4525,4541,4570,4574,4589,4610,4611,4615,4626,4641,4644,4699,4740,4783,4816,4820,4843,4857,4905,4906,4907,4919,4956,5042,5096,5156,5167,5209,5214,5257,5266,5275,5277,5300,5307,5323,5349,5411,5414,5451,5453,5466,5485,5486,5529,5530,5578,5583,5593,5609,5688,5697,5789,5812,5813,5823,5851,5896,5900,5901,5905,5989,5999,6079,6113,6216,6232,6237,6238,6245,6246,6263,6356,6362,6376,6391,6426,6461,6468,6540,6622,6624,6646,6693,6694,6713,6726,6736,6788,6828,6829,6870,6889,7038,7041,7046,7051,7055,7074,7091,7092,7097,7120,7335,7369,7412,7419,7498,7500,7515,7621,7670,8130,8144,8157,8175,8300,8795,8803,8851,8905,8915,8926,8983,9022,9023,9154,9156,9160,9183,9222,9291,9310,9322,9328,9374,9448,9626,9636,9698,9700,9728,9795,9796,9797,9802,9838,9870,9873,9874,9907,9913,9932,9961,10008,10368,10372,10373,10376,10389,10678,11246,11539,11558,11789,11818,11963,12282,12288,12291,12424,12435,12442,12462,12492,12951,12953,13036,13082,13192,13193,13194,13195,13196,13197,13198,13199,13200,13201,13202,13203,16717,22219,22220],"themes":[1,17,22,23],"genres":[5,15],"first_release_date":1272499200000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[9,38,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1275955200000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Jun-08","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1276819200000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Jun-18","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1272499200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Apr-29","y":2010,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1276732800000,"region":3,"human":"2010-Jun-17","y":2010,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1320710400000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Nov-08","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1320710400000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Nov-08","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1320883200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Nov-10","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1320883200000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Nov-10","y":2011,"m":11},{"category

is a strategy game in which players must save present-day Earth from an alien invasion. As players manage resources, research weapon technology, and monitor alien presence, they can dispatch squads of soldiers to attack human- and insect-like creatures in turn-based combat. From a 3/4-top-down perspective, players use assault rifles, grenades, and other military-grade weapons to kill nearby enemies. Battles are accompanied by intermittent cutscenes that depict close-up (e.g., over-the-shoulder) instances of violence: soldiers getting impaled or beaten to death by alien creatures; realistic explosions that result in larger blood sprays. If an alien “implants” an egg into a dead human, the character will eventually explode amid additional gibbing effects. Some scenes depict dead or dying soldiers whose bodies are burned or mutilated. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/200510"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.xcom.com/enemyunknown/"}],"external":{"steam":"200510"}},{"id":3182,"name":"Diablo III: Reaper of Souls","slug":"diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/diablo-iii-reaper-of-souls","created_at":1384856392221,"updated_at":1540922822426,"summary":"Diablo III is an action role-playing game that takes place throughout the dark fantasy world of Sanctuary.\n\n You play a hero who engages in fast-paced combat that tests your reflexes and rewards tactical decisions.

is an action game in which players assume the role of Corvo, a royal bodyguard who has been framed for treason (i.e., assassinating an empress). As players help Corvo exact revenge on those who betrayed him, they can use pistols, crossbows, swords, and grenades to kill human enemies in ranged and melee-style combat. Violence is sometimes accompanied by slow-motion effects and gurgling sounds from Corvo's victims. Certain weapons result in dismembered limbs, and attacks are accompanied by exaggerated blood-splatter effects. Some environments depict mutilated corpses on the ground or hanging from the ceiling. During one interactive sequence, Corvo brands a restrained man's cheek with a hot iron; in another, players use electric shocks to interrogate a blindfolded man in a chair. The game depicts some female characters in revealing outfits and includes some sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “Hey sweetheart, you want to play with me? You're a lot cuter than my regulars,”“This one thinks only of whores,” and “Sell your wife into prostitution, I'm sure I can get you a good price.”). The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can also be heard in the game.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.dishonored.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/205100"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/dishonored"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonored"},{"category":2,"url":"http://dishonored.wikia.com/wiki/Dishonored_Wiki"}],"external":{"steam":"205100"}},{"id":105,"name":"Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit","slug":"need-for-speed-hot-pursuit","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit","created_at":1298028215000,"updated_at":1541331708457,"summary":"Become Seacrest County's top cop or most wanted racer!","collection":12,"rating":82.6105415003468,"popularity":7.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":89.75,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":86.1802707501734,"total_rating_count":125,"rating_count":115,"games":[3193,98,101,2074,102,97,10965,561,99,26948],"tags":[1,38,268435466,268435469,268435470,268435487,268435489,536870933,536871647,536871690,536871851,536872070,536872205,536872245,536872321,536872423,536872581,536872695,536873364,536873455,536874007,536875047,536875069,536875133,536875154,536875157,536875272,536875293,536875432,536875488,536875490,536875715,536875781,536875802,536876026,536876171,536876419,536876435,536876484,536876514,536876599,536876666,536876695,536876762,536876821,536876948,536877108,536877144,536877181,536877311,536877499,536877677,536877726,536877953,536877994,536877999,536878001,536878026,536878133,536879175,536879184,536879979,536879981,536880875,536880915,536881937,536882021,536882034,536882304,536882645,536882667,536882979,536883195,536883218,536883374,536883375,536883596,536883597,536890529,536892298,536892299,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[347,94,348],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[122],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":64800},"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2,3,5],"keywords":[21,735,778,939,1158,1293,1333,1409,1511,1669,1783,2452,2543,3095,4135,4157,4221,4242,4245,4360,4381,4520,4576,4578,4803,4869,4890,5114,5259,5507,5523,5572,5602,5687,5754,5783,5850,5909,6036,6196,6232,6269,6399,6587,6765,6814,7041,7082,7087,7089,7114,7221,8263,8272,9067,9069,9963,10003,11025,11109,11122,11392,11733,11755,12067,12283,12306,12462,12463,12684,12685,19617,21386,21387],"themes":[1,38],"genres":[10,13,14,31,33],"first_release_date":1289865600000,"platforms":[6,39,92,9,12,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1289865600000,"region":8,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1290124800000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Nov-19","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1289865600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1289865600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1290124800000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Nov-19","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":92,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":39,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Need for Speed 2010","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zoptpsw7ngkyztdusyxr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zoptpsw7ngkyztdusyxr","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/upgcxppizn8tpaimz0gr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"upgcxppizn8tpaimz0gr","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/deb8mglhuspumin5yghl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"deb8mglhuspumin5yghl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hhlmn1eisax9wigprxvl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hhlmn1eisax9wigprxvl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a8tljw5ltoepwulsmo3v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a8tljw5ltoepwulsmo3v","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"w06n-ui79tM"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cxnm0ptxfiuyhdo2bnml.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cxnm0ptxfiuyhdo2bnml","width":751,"height":946},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an arcade-style racing game in which players drive customizable real-world cars around urban streets and highways.

is a third-person action game in which players assume the role of an engineer (Isaac Clarke) who must fight his way through hordes of aliens aboard a space station. Players use futuristic weapons (e.g., plasma guns, flamethrowers, electrified spikes) to kill a variety of mutated creatures—attacks generally result in cries of pain, dismemberment, and large spurts of blood. Some cutscenes depict close-up views of characters getting stabbed in the face by blades and needle instruments. Several environments depict mutilated bodies, as well as blood-splattered floors, walls, and ceilings. The words \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\" can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://deadspace.ea.com/"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Space_2"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/47780"}],"external":{"steam":"47780"}},{"id":981,"name":"Rayman Origins","slug":"rayman-origins","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/rayman-origins","created_at":1321470315000,"updated_at":1541183611726,"summary":"Bubble Dreamer, Rayman, his best friend Globox, and some Teensy friends are chilling out at the Bubble Dreamer's resting grounds, the Snoring Tree.

As a result, the ensuing disaster causes the Bubble Dreamer to go crazy and have nightmares. Although they are captured, Rayman and his friends are able to escape the Darktoons.

is an action platformer in which players assume the role of Rayman and his “cartoony” friends as they rescue creatures from evil forces. As players run, jump, and fly through side-scrolling levels, they can use various attacks (e.g., punches, kicks, slaps) to defeat enemy creatures (e.g., goblins, wrestlers, skeletons); enemies disappear into puffs of smoke when defeated. Boss battles are more protracted, as players shoot projectiles at large dragons, frogs, and wrestlers. During the course of the game, players can unlock and wear a variety of costumes; one costume depicts characters with small fig leaves covering their pelvic areas.","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":2},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayman_Legends"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/242550"},{"category":1,"url":"http://rayman.ubi.com/legends/"},{"category":2,"url":"http://rayman.ubi.com/legends/en-US/home/index.aspx"}],"external":{"steam":"242550"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":4},{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false},{"platform":41,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":5,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":43,"name":"Deus Ex: Human Revolution","slug":"deus-ex-human-revolution","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution","created_at":1297808369000,"updated_at":1541214337477,"summary":"In Deus Ex: Human Revolution you play Adam Jensen, a security specialist, handpicked to oversee the defense of one of America's most experimental biotechnology firms.

is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of Adam Jensen, an ex-cop who must uncover the truth behind a cybernetics company's attack. Players complete mission-based objectives to increase their character's skills (e.g., stealth, strength) and advance the main storyline. Players use pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and explosives to kill a variety of human enemies (e.g., soldiers, police officers, gang members, drug dealers). Players can also use stealth attacks (e.g., choking, electrocution) to dispatch enemies at close range. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, explosions, and large sprays of blood that stain the surrounding environment. Players can sometimes make choices that result in the death of innocent characters: during one sequence, an injured man asks to be “put out of his misery”—the main character can then administer a morphine overdose. Civilians can also be killed directly, though this may negatively affect players' progress. As the game progresses, alcoholic beverages (e.g., beer, vodka, cocktails) can be purchased and consumed to reduce damage, resulting in a screen-blurring effect. In one mission, players can plant “illegal drugs” in a character's residence; marijuana products (i.e., “cigaweed”) are occasionally referenced in the dialogue. Some missions contain sexual material: a brothel room containing a sex toy on the bed; dialogue with prostitutes (e.g., “They want me to get augmentations . . . for the customer's pleasure. It's sick” and “[W]e can find a quiet spot . . . Do you have enough money for me, sexy?”). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Deus_Ex:_Human_Revolution"}]},{"id":2155,"name":"Dark Souls","slug":"dark-souls","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/dark-souls","created_at":1372018777145,"updated_at":1541348653490,"summary":"Dark Souls is the new action role-playing game from the developers who brought you Demon’s Souls, FromSoftware. Dark Souls will have many familiar features: A dark fantasy universe, tense dungeon crawling, fearsome enemy encounters and unique online interactions. Dark Souls is a spiritual successor to Demon’s, not a sequel. Prepare for a new, despair-inducing world, with a vast, fully-explorable horizon and vertically-oriented landforms. Prepare for a new, mysterious story, centered around the world of Lodran, but most of all, prepare to die. You will face countless murderous traps, countless darkly grotesque mobs and several gargantuan, supremely powerful demons and dragons bosses. You must learn from death to persist through this unforgiving world. And you aren’t alone. Dark Souls allows the spirits of other players to show up in your world, so you can learn from their deaths and they can learn from yours. You can also summon players into your world to co-op adventure, or invade other's worlds to PVP battle. New to Dark Souls are Bonfires, which serve as check points as you fight your way through this epic adventure. While rested at Bonfires, your health and magic replenish but at a cost, all mobs respawn. Beware: There is no place in Dark Souls that is truly safe.

Players roam Wild West environments and use shotguns, pistols, rifles, torches, and dynamite to kill attacking zombies. Players can engage in melee-style hand-to-hand combat and trigger slow-motion effects by shooting enemies at close-range or by targeted shooting (e.g., head shots). Blood often spurts out of characters when shot; close-range assaults cause much larger sprays. Some weapons cause zombies to explode into body parts, and one sequence depicts body parts lying on the ground (e.g., zombies eating a corpse). The game contains zombie characters in revealing outfits and sexual references in the dialogue (e.g, \"I'll give you a quickie later,\"\". . . filthy whore-mongering wretch,\"\"Oh my God, you're a voyeur! You're peeping in on our love.\").

is a first-person shooter, set in a fictional city-in-the sky (Columbia), in which players assume the role of a private investigator searching for a mysterious woman. As players explore the city, they encounter a variety of armed guards, thugs, and mechanical creations that attack the central character. Players use pistols, shotguns, rifles, and machine guns to kill these enemies. A three-pronged hook can be used to dismember and decapitate several enemies. Players can also use an assortment of special powers to defeat enemies (e.g., setting characters on fire, electrocuting them). Large blood-splatter effects occur when characters are injured. Enemies are also depicted beating themselves with a bat or shooting themselves in the head when they are possessed; during one sequence, a character intentionally sets herself on fire. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in suggestive/sexual dialogue (e.g., “Obscenity and fornication everywhere!”“Could use a good roll in the hay after this,”“I think yeh gave me the clap, ya dirty boy…”). The game allows players' character to obtain \"health\" by consuming beer and whiskey; the screen turns fuzzy and distorted if the player consumes too many drinks. The social/political backdrop of the fictional city (set in the year 1912) includes the use of derogatory ethnic/racial terms (e.g., the words \"gook,\"\"chink,\"\"negroes,\"\"injuns,\"\"crackers\"); language such as \"sh*t\" can also be heard in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Strong language.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.bioshockinfinite.com/"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/8870"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/bioshock"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock_Infinite"},{"category":2,"url":"http://bioshock.wikia.com/"}],"external":{"steam":"8870"}},{"id":72,"name":"Portal 2","slug":"portal-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/portal-2","created_at":1297956069000,"updated_at":1541529218134,"summary":"Sequel to the acclaimed Portal (2007), Portal 2 pits the protagonist of the original game, Chell, and her new robot friend, Wheatley, against more puzzles conceived by GLaDOS, an A.I. with the sole purpose of testing the Portal Gun's mechanics and taking revenge on Chell for the events of Portal.

The words \"damn\" and \"hell\" can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":4},"pegi":{"rating":3},"websites":[{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/Portal"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/620"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.thinkwithportals.com/"}],"external":{"steam":"620"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":true,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":15,"name":"Fallout 3","slug":"fallout-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/fallout-3","created_at":1297681667000,"updated_at":1541533566572,"summary":"Fallout 3 from the creators of the award-winning Oblivion, featuring one of the most realized game worlds ever created. Create any kind of character you want and explore the open wastes of post-apocalyptic Washington D.C. Every minute is a fight for survival as you encounter Super Mutants, Ghouls, Raiders and other dangers of the Wasteland. Prepare for the future. \n \nThe third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.","storyline":"The introductory sequence introduces the player to their character's father James, a doctor and scientist in Vault 101. James frequently makes comments about the player character's deceased mother Catherine, and her favorite Bible passage, Revelation 21:6, which speaks of \"the waters of life\". \n \nThe main quest begins after the player is forced to flee Vault 101 when James leaves the vault, throwing it into anarchy and causing the paranoid Overseer to send his security force after the player. The search for James takes the character on a journey through the Wasteland, first to the nearby town of Megaton, named for the undetonated atomic bomb at the center of town, then the Galaxy News Radio station, whose enthusiastic DJ Three Dog gives the player the moniker of \"The Lone Wanderer\". The player travels to Rivet City, a derelict aircraft carrier now serving as a fortified human settlement. Here the player meets Doctor Li, a scientist who worked alongside the player's father. Doctor Li informs the player of Project Purity, a plan conceived by Catherine and James to purify all the water in the Tidal Basin and eventually the entire Potomac River with a giant water purifier built in the Jefferson Memorial. However, continued delays and Catherine's death during childbirth put an end to the project, and James took the player's character as a newborn to raise them in the safety of Vault 101. \nAfter investigating the Jefferson Memorial, the Lone Wanderer tracks James to Vault 112, and frees him from a virtual reality program being run by the Vault's sadistic Overseer, Dr. Braun. James and the player return to Rivet City, and James reveals he sought out Braun for information on the Garden of Eden Creation Kit (G.E.C.K.), a device that contains the components needed to finally activate Project Purity. James and Doctor Li lead a team of Rivet City scientists to the memorial with intent to restart the project, but the memorial is invaded by the Enclave, a powerful military organization formed from the remnants of the pre-War United States government. James floods the project's control room with radiation to stop the Enclave military leader, Colonel Augustus Autumn, from taking control of it, killing himself (but Autumn survives), his last words urging his child to run. The Lone Wanderer and Dr. Li flee to the ruins of the Pentagon, now a base for the Brotherhood of Steel and now known as the Citadel. With Project Purity still inoperational even with the Enclave occupying the site, the player travels to Vault 87 to find a G.E.C.K. and finish James's work. The player finds the Vault to be a testing site for the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus), and the source of the Super Mutants in the Capital Wasteland. After the player acquires the G.E.C.K., the Wanderer is ambushed by the Enclave and captured. \nAt the Enclave base at Raven Rock, the player is freed from their cell by the Enclave leader, President John Henry Eden, who requests a private audience with them. En route to his office however, Colonel Autumn defies Eden's orders and takes command of the Enclave military, ordering them to kill the player. Fighting their way to Eden's office, the player discovers Eden is actually a sentient ZAX series supercomputer who took control of the Enclave after their defeat in Fallout 2 on the West Coast thirty years ago. Eden wishes to repeat the plan of then-President Dick Richardson using Project Purity, infecting the water with a modified strain of FEV that will make it toxic to any mutated life. This plan will kill most life in the wasteland including humans, but the Enclave, due to their genetic \"purity\" as a result of their isolation, will be immune and free to take control of the area. The Wanderer, provided with a sample of the new F.E.V., is given a choice to either leave peacefully or convince Eden to self-destruct the entire base. The Lone Wanderer escapes Raven Rock and returns to the Citadel. \n \nWith the knowledge they possess, the G.E.C.K. and the means to activate Project Purity, the Brotherhood assault the Jefferson Memorial, spearheaded by a giant robot named Liberty Prime. In the control room of Project Purity the player confronts Colonel Autumn, and has the choice to persuade him to give up or kill him. Dr. Li informs the player that the purifier is ready to be activated, but the activation code must be input manually, and also that the control room is flooded with lethal amounts of radiation. The Lone Wanderer is forced to choose between sending Sarah Lyons of the Brotherhood inside the extremely irradiated purifier or entering themselves.

3  is a action role-playing game set in the barren wasteland of a post-apocalyptic society. Players assume the role of a resident of an underground complex who emerges from a vault to explore a wastleland universe through a series of quests/missions. Mission objectives sometimes involve exploring various caves, sewers, and subway tunnels, while other quests involve combat with human and mutant survivors. Fighting can be frenetic and intense, highlighted by various camera effects (e.g., slow motion, blurring, screen shakes) and depictions of realistic dismemberment with trails of red blood. In one scene, players enter a black-and-white virtual reality simulation in which they use a kitchen knife to kill household members and pets. Characters are sometimes seen consuming fictional drugs (e.g., \"Buffout,\" \"Jet,\" and \"Mentats\"), while the player can also use – with no visual depiction of consuming/administering – a narcotic called \"psycho,\" which with repeated uses leads to addiction. A screen-blurring effect indicates the state of characters' intoxication and the need to use the narcotic to fend off various side effects. Several of the characters are prostitutes and the details of their sexual activities are mildly insinuated (e.g., \"You got the cash I got the time…I take care of men around here.\"). Strong profanity can also be heard throughout the game (e.g., \"f*ck,\" \"a*shole,\" and \"sh*t\").","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/Fallout"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/Fallout"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3"},{"category":2,"url":"http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_3"},{"category":1,"url":"http://fallout.bethsoft.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/22300"}],"external":{"steam":"22300"}},{"id":109,"name":"L.A.

Noire is a neo-noir detective action-adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games. It was initially released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms on 17 May 2011; a Microsoft Windows port was later released on 8 November 2011. \n \nL.A. Noire is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and challenges the player, controlling a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, to solve a range of cases across five divisions. Players must investigate crime scenes for clues, follow up leads, and interrogate suspects, and the player's success at these activities will impact how much of each case's story is revealed. \n \nThe game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir—stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s that share similar visual styles and themes, including crime and moral ambiguity—along with drawing inspiration from real-life crimes for its in-game cases, based upon what was reported by the Los Angeles media in 1947. \n \nThe game uses a distinctive colour palette, but in homage to film noir it includes the option to play the game in black and white. Various plot elements reference the major themes of detective and mobster stories such as The Naked City, Chinatown, The Untouchables, The Black Dahlia, and L.A. Confidential.","storyline":"Amid the post-war boom of Hollywood's Golden Age, Cole Phelps is an LAPD detective thrown headfirst into a city drowning in its own success. Corruption is rampant, the drug trade is exploding, and murder rates are at an all-time high. In his fight to climb the ranks and do what's right, Phelps must unravel the truth behind a string of arson attacks, racketeering conspiracies and brutal murders, battling the L.A. underworld and even members of his own department to uncover a secret that could shake the city to its rotten

Set in late 1940s Los Angeles, the game allows players to advance through various 'desks' at a police department (i.e., Patrol, Traffic Squad, Homicide, Vice, Arson) by interviewing witnesses and suspects, searching crime scenes for clues, and apprehending criminals. Players use pistols, rifles, machine guns, and flamethrowers to engage in firefights with various enemies—these shootouts are highlighted by realistic gunfire, cries of pain, and blood spurts that stain injured characters and the surrounding environment. Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, including a character being beaten with a crowbar (off screen)—large spurts of blood are depicted in the foreground. During the course of the game, players may come across crime scenes in which badly beaten or mutilated corpses are subject to investigation; players are able to examine victims' bodies close-up, surveying various bruises and bloody cuts for evidence—a few female corpses are depicted fully nude with fleeting images of pubic hair. Investigations sometimes pertain to sexual assault crimes, and details are often conveyed in clinical terms through dialogue or on-screen text (e.g., 'He's some kind of sex fiend,' 'Woman's briefs torn at seams, forcibly removed,' and 'Head trauma . . . external bruising to genitals.'). In one cutscene, there is an implication that a character is engaged in a sexual relationship with a teenager (e.g., 'You take love where you can find it as you get older, Jack'/That has nothing to do with love . . .'). Some sequences allow players to collect/manipulate drug-related evidence such as marijuana packets, morphine syringes, or amphetamine pills; in one cutscene, a doctor can be seen injecting a character with morphine. Language such as 'f**k,' 'sh*t,' 'c*nt,' 'n**ger,' and 'sp*c' can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Descriptions of criminal techniques - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.rockstargames.com/lanoire/agegate/ref/?redirect="},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Noire"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/110800"},{"category":2,"url":"http://lanoire.wikia.com/"}],"external":{"steam":"110800"}},{"id":472,"name":"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim","slug":"the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim","created_at":1301166960000,"updated_at":1541535841843,"summary":"The next chapter in the highly anticipated Elder Scrolls saga arrives from the makers of the 2006 and 2008 Games of the Year, Bethesda Game Studios.

is a fantasy role-playing game in which players assume the role of Dovakin, a prophesied figure with the power to combat dragons in the fictional world of Skyrim. As players traverse through mountainous \"open-world\" environments, they complete missions and quests that impact the eventual fate of their character. Players use swords, bows and arrows, axes, and magic attacks (e.g., fireballs, ice shards) to kill various enemies (e.g., wolves, dragons, human bandits and soldiers). As players engage in melee-style combat, some sequences are highlighted by slow-motion effects, particularly for decapitations. Large blood-splatter effects also occur during combat, and some environments are stained with blood or body parts (e.g., heads impaled on spikes). Some sequences allow players to injure/kill nonadversary characters, including prisoners chained to a wall; they scream in pain amid splashes of blood or fire. As the game progresses, the dialogue and on-screen text contains references to sexual material (e.g., “. . . all the whores your heart, or any other organ, desires,”“She . . . raped the men as cruelly as Bal had ravished her,” and “Remember when you thought [he] was . . . intent on making you . . . into his personal sex slave?”). Alcohol such as wine, mead, and ale can be purchased and consumed by players' character throughout the game; in one sequence, players can engage in a drinking contest with another character, which eventually results in slurred speech (e.g., “One more. No problemsh . . . Thash grape!”).","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Violence towards defenceless people.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/BethesdaSoftworks"},{"category":1,"url":"http://elderscrolls.com/"},{"category":14,"url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim"},{"category":2,"url":"http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skyrim"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/elderscrolls"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/ElderScrolls"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/ElderScrolls"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Skyrim"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850"}],"external":{"steam":"72850"}},{"id":59,"name":"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion","slug":"the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion","created_at":1297933330000,"updated_at":1541535871344,"summary":"After the mysterious and untimely death of the Emperor, desperate factions vie for control of Tamriel's throne.

Players defend the U.S. from Russian armed forces, engage in skirmishes and combat missions, and track the ultranationalist in an attempt to discover his true motivations and co-conspirators. Players use machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, and missiles to kill enemy soldiers throughout the battlefields. Realistic gunfire, explosions, and cries of pain are heard during the frequent and fast-paced combat. The most intense depiction of violence occurs during a 'No Russian' mission where players take on the role of an undercover Ranger: Several civilians are gunned down at an airport as players are given a choice to participate in the killings (e.g., players can shoot a wounded civilian that is crawling on the ground), or walk by and observe without opening fire. In either case, civilians scream and emit pools of blood as they are shot to death. Within the multiplayer portion of the game, players can unlock 'emblems' to be used on their player name cards. Some of these emblems contain images that reference drugs (e.g., a cannabis leaf; a name card with a depiction of a joint). Dialogue in the game contains profanity in both English (e.g., 'sh*t') and Russian (e.g., 'f**k' and 'motherf**ker').","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"https://www.callofduty.com/"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/10180"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/callofduty"},{"category":6,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/callofduty"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/Callofduty"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty%3A_Modern_Warfare_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_2"}],"external":{"steam":"10180"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":352,"name":"Battlefield: Bad Company 2","slug":"battlefield-bad-company-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/battlefield-bad-company-2","created_at":1300354857000,"updated_at":1541493257959,"summary":"Battlefield: Bad Company 2 brings the award-winning Battlefield gameplay to the forefront of PC gaming with best-in-class vehicular combat and unexpected \"Battlefield moments.\" \n \nNew vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield.

is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of Jason Brody, a vacationing thrill-seeker whose friends have been captured by pirates. As Jason attempts to rescue his companions, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, explosives, and melee attacks to kill human enemies in frenetic combat. Players can also perform stealth attacks to sneak on enemies (e.g., using a knife to stab them from behind, at close range). Battles are accompanied by realistic screams of pain, gunfire, and large explosions; injured enemies emit large splashes of blood when injured. Some cutscenes and interactive sequences depict more intense acts of violence: characters stabbed in the neck, head, and chest; a restrained character slit in the throat; a man climbing through a mass grave of mutilated corpses. In one sequence, a villain cuts off a character's finger; in another, a restrained character is beaten during an extended interrogation. As the game progresses, a handful of scenes depict Jason's interactions with a topless female character; a cutscene depicts sexual activity between them (i.e., the brief sequence portrays the female character from a first-person perspective, though no genitals are depicted). Illegal drugs are occasionally referenced in the game, and one scene depicts a man smoking a marijuana joint. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “c*nt” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://farcrygame.com"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/UbisoftUS"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/FarCrygame"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Cry_3"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/220240"}],"external":{"steam":"220240"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":74,"name":"Mass Effect 2","slug":"mass-effect-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mass-effect-2","created_at":1298019677000,"updated_at":1541423573036,"summary":"Are you prepared to lose everything to save the galaxy?

this action role-playing game, players' objective is to defeat an alien enemy that is silently abducting entire human colonies. Players must assemble a team of henchmen, command a space ship, and travel to distant planets across a futuristic galaxy. At its core, the game involves a combination of conversation/interaction with characters, and ground-based (i.e., \"run-and-gun\") space battle: Players use assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and pistols to kill humans, robots, and aliens in the frenetic third-person firefights. Some enemies emit large splashes of blood when shot (particularly with \"head shots\"); several enemies lie stagnant in pools of blood—factors for the Mature rating. Henchmen are able to freeze and shatter enemies, engage in melee attacks, set robots on fire, and use telekinesis to disable aliens. A handful of cutscenes depict dramatic interrogations in which human characters are threatened, punched, kicked, and shot (in the leg) by alien creatures. The game contains themes of illicit drug use, addiction, and trafficking—often focal points to the branching storylines; for example, \"Morinth likes dancing while on a drug called Hallex,\"\"Narcotics flooded my veins when I attacked,\" and \"The asari injecting so many drugs into me was terrifying.\" During the course of the game, players may enter a bar where alien pole dancing exists (choreography highlighted on big-screen monitors) or hear suggestive comments such as \" krogan  sexual deviants enjoy  salarian  flexibility\" and\"if this is just about sex, maybe you should just  f**king  say so.\" [Italics added] Players can also choose to have \"romantic encounters\" with the alien/human henchmen characters; this involves watching a guided cutscene in which two characters flirt, kiss, and/or embrace: clothed alien/human characters may prop a partner on top of a space console, clear away the clutter from a bed-slab, unzip a future-blouse, or just talk it out. Though an alien/human may gyrate her hips while on top (fleeting—one-to-two seconds), actual sexis never depicted—the cameracuts awaytospace furniture and ceilings.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://masseffect.bioware.com/"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/24980"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/biowaremasseffect"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/masseffect"},{"category":6,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/masseffect"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/masseffect"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2"},{"category":2,"url":"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_2"}],"external":{"steam":"24980"}},{"id":127,"name":"Assassin's Creed II","slug":"assassin-s-creed-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/assassin-s-creed-ii","created_at":1300112387000,"updated_at":1541423779544,"summary":"Discover an intriguing and epic story of power, revenge and conspiracy set during a pivotal moment in history: the Italian Renaissance. \nExperience the freedom and immersion of an all new open world and mission structure with settings such as the rooftops and canals of beautiful Venice.

himself.","collection":18,"franchise":571,"franchises":[571],"rating":86.9299368307291,"popularity":24.0,"aggregated_rating":90.25,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":88.58996841536455,"total_rating_count":869,"rating_count":858,"games":[113,8223,1970,128,5606,499,1266,537,3025,14902],"tags":[1,17,18,22,23,33,38,268435464,268435487,536870934,536871033,536871041,536871044,536871063,536871082,536871133,536871139,536871169,536871196,536871213,536871302,536871535,536871882,536871931,536871945,536872010,536872014,536872070,536872098,536872140,536872205,536872315,536872371,536872550,536872587,536872626,536872647,536872798,536872871,536872961,536872964,536872983,536873067,536873082,536873192,536873236,536873328,536873364,536873455,536873456,536873473,536873674,536874190,536874345,536874398,536874552,536874813,536875042,536875046,536875047,536875050,536875052,536875067,536875073,536875081,536875091,536875096,536875099,536875106,536875130,536875131,536875157,536875162,536875178,536875199,536875229,536875257,536875265,536875271,536875272,536875300,536875301,536875304,536875306,536875322,536875373,536875396,536875400,536875401,536875403,536875406,536875420,536875432,536875437,536875453,536875456,536875488,536875492,536875503,536875523,536875525,536875527,536875530,536875538,536875614,536875649,536875665,536875682,536875688,536875695,536875705,536875745,536875755,536875764,536875771,536875776,536875778,536875781,536875782,536875802,536875803,536875808,536875815,536875819,536875822,536875830,536875837,536875853,536875891,536875896,536875902,536875933,536875937,536876007,536876008,536876029,536876034,536876054,536876062,536876171,536876174,536876189,536876219,536876220,536876235,536876241,536876303,536876309,536876312,536876330,536876356,536876359,536876378,536876400,536876429,536876476,536876478,536876487,536876505,536876545,536876553,536876560,536876569,536876580,536876586,536876606,536876622,536876695,536876703,536876706,536876722,536876726,536876730,536876755,536876762,536876817,536876851,536876853,536876866,536876875,536876901,536876910,536876911,536876919,536876922,536876964,536876991,536877039,536877057,536877123,536877124,536877125,536877137,536877144,536877150,536877164,536877207,536877216,536877237,536877239,536877275,536877294,536877303,536877335,536877373,536877377,536877401,536877405,536877453,536877543,536877566,536877614,536877657,536877664,536877679,536877726,536877739,536877771,536877897,536877957,536877960,536877985,536877992,536878007,536878019,536878026,536878034,536878072,536878083,536878127,536878198,536878201,536878222,536878256,536878257,536878259,536878264,536878277,536878279,536878359,536878367,536878374,536878401,536878410,536878486,536878505,536878507,536878523,536878524,536878525,536878562,536878577,536879047,536879059,536879062,536879063,536879064,536879066,536879068,536879069,536879073,536879075,536879077,536879078,536879080,536879082,536879084,536879085,536879086,536879087,536879212,536879223,536879739,536879740,536879741,536879742,536879743,536879744,536879745,536879750,536879752,536879753,536879754,536879755,536879756,536879757,536879758,536879759,536879760,536879761,536879762,536879764,536879765,536879766,536879767,536879768,536879770,536879771,536879772,536879773,536879774,536879775,536879776,536879777,536879778,536879779,536879783,536879784,536879785,536880294,536880441,536881123,536881230,536881258,536881499,536881937,536882125,536882210,536882386,536882817,536883865,536883898,536883948,536883980,536883994,536884121,536884253,1073741826],"developers":[38],"publishers":[104],"game_engines":[9,8],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":74370,"normally":95400,"completely":131040},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[22,121,129,132,151,170,221,227,257,284,301,390,623,970,1019,1033,1098,1102,1158,1186,1228,1293,1403,1459,1638,1675,1714,1735,1886,1959,2049,2052,2071,2155,2170,2280,2324,2416,2452,2543,2544,2561,2762,3278,3433,3486,3640,3901,4130,4134,4135,4138,4140,4155,4161,4169,4179,4184,4187,4194,4218,4219,4245,4250,4266,4287,4317,4345,4353,4359,4360,4388,4389,4392,4394,4410,4461,4484,4488,4489,4491,4494,4508,4520,4525,4541,4544,4576,4580,4591,4611,4613,4615,4618,4626,4702,4737,4753,4770,4776,4783,4793,4833,4843,4852,4859,4864,4866,4869,4870,4890,4891,4896,4903,4907,4910,4918,4925,4941,4979,4984,4990,5021,5025,5095,5096,5117,5122,5142,5150,5259,5262,5277,5307,5308,5323,5329,5391,5397,5400,5418,5444,5447,5466,5488,5517,5564,5566,5575,5593,5633,5641,5648,5657,5668,5674,5694,5710,5783,5791,5794,5810,5814,5818,5843,5850,5905,5939,5941,5954,5963,5989,5998,5999,6007,6010,6052,6079,6127,6145,6211,6212,6213,6225,6232,6238,6252,6295,6304,6325,6327,6363,6382,6391,6423,6461,6465,6489,6493,6541,6631,6654,6702,6745,6752,6767,6814,6827,6859,6985,7045,7048,7073,7080,7095,7107,7114,7122,7160,7171,7215,7286,7289,7310,7344,7345,7347,7352,7365,7367,7447,7455,7462,7489,7498,7574,7593,7595,7611,7612,7613,7650,7665,8135,8147,8150,8151,8152,8154,8156,8157,8161,8163,8165,8166,8168,8170,8

\"relive\" the life of an assassin during the Italian Renaissance in this open-world action adventure game. The goal is to exact revenge upon conspirators who have framed and executed loved ones; the goal is to be accomplished through assassination. As players roam the crowded streets of Florence, Italy, they can creep through catacombs and corridors, undertake diverse side-missions, and tail-and-assassinate all manner of human targets—politicians, Templar soldiers, conspirators. Players can also brawl with family rivals or engage in sword fights with Templar soldiers, but in most cases, they use stealth techniques to complete the mission; for example, players can sneak up on enemies from behind and kill them with hidden daggers, poisoned daggers, spring-activated blades, and swords. When blades connect, blood shoots out in a fountain-like manner as targets groan or scream. These stealth-kills are sometimes depicted close-up and are somewhat graphic: the camera follows the \"herky-jerky\" thrusts of the blade; the player hears a distinctly \"wet\" flesh-impact sound. The most graphic depictions of violence occur during cinematic cutscenes (the following two scenes do not involve players' character): A businessman, crawling away from a Templar leader, gets pinned to the ground by a sword through his neck; a young nobleman is ambushed by rivals, begs for mercy, then gets stabbed multiple times in the chest amid screams of \"Muori! Mouri! Mouri!\" [Die! Die! Die!]. The spurts and sprays of blood that accompany some of the stabbing attacks can be intense.  The game contains strong sexual overtones. During one \"seduction mini-game,\" players are able to press buttons to kiss a woman and remove her dress; with the woman's back facing the camera, the two characters lower to bed and blow out a candle. Some scenes take place inside brothels, though no nudity or sexual acts are depicted. The dialogue contains the following sexual references: \"So the whip or the paddle today?\" and \"Does your wife know about your page-boy fantasies, Captain?\" Character backstories, narrated through still-frame vignettes, explain how villains and historical figures achieved their notoriety; some biographies include references to adultery, sodomy, prostitution, and rape (e.g., \"Caterina was captured and sent to Rodrigo Borgia . . . who kept her imprisoned for a year and is rumored to have raped her alongside his son.\"). One cutscene depicts a man and a woman wearing translucent, flesh-toned bodysuits as they flee from danger. The digitized lighting effects, the glow from their futuristic suits, obscure most of the details, though outlines of breasts and buttocks are partially discernable (i.e., not definitively nudity). Consumers may also wish to know that the game contains strong profanity, both in English and Italian (e.g., \"f**k,\"\"sh*t,\" c*zzo,\" and \"m*rda\"); the most explicit instance occurs when a man frantically describes a \"vision\"—\"I'm at the opera . . . the soprano is so beautiful . . . I'm in bed with her, she cries as I f**k her.\"","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_II"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.assassinscreed.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/33230"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/assassinscreed"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/assassinscreed_us"},{"category":6,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/assassinscreed"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/assassinscreed"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/assassinscreed"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed_II"}],"external":{"steam":"33230"}},{"id":233,"name":"Half-Life 2","slug":"half-life-2","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/half-life-2","created_at":1300349787000,"updated_at":1541466931201,"summary":"Half-Life 2 (stylized as HλLF-LIFE²), the sequel to Half-Life, is a first-person shooter video game and part of the Half-Life series.

After arriving at the station and eluding Combine forces, Gordon joins Lambda resistance members including Barney Calhoun, a former Black Mesa security guard now working undercover as a Combine CP officer, and Alyx Vance, the daughter of one of Gordon's former colleagues, Dr. Eli Vance. After a failed attempt to teleport Gordon to Black Mesa East from Dr. Kleiner's makeshift laboratory, Gordon, re-equipped with the HEV suit and a crowbar, is forced to embark on foot through the city's old canal system. After obtaining an airboat, he battles his way to Black Mesa East, several miles from the city. \nGordon is reintroduced to Eli and meets Dr. Judith Mossman. Alyx introduces Gordon to her large pet robot D0g and gives him a \"Gravity Gun\", a weapon which allows Gordon to pick up and move any large object with ease. Black Mesa East soon comes under Combine attack and Eli and Mossman are captured to be taken to a Combine prison, Nova Prospekt. Gordon and Alyx are forced to take separate paths to Nova Prospekt; Gordon takes a detour through the town of Ravenholm, receiving help from its last survivor, Father Grigori. After making his way through the town and a mine, Gordon makes his way to a Resistance outpost. Gordon is provided with a Dune Buggy, which he uses to travel along a crumbling coastal road to Nova Prospekt. Along the way, Gordon encounters frequent Combine patrols, and helps one of the resistance leaders, Colonel Odessa Cubbage, to defend a Resistance base from a Combine gunship. \nAfter crossing an antlion-infested beach, Gordon enters Nova Prospekt, where he is reunited with Alyx. They manage to locate Eli, but also discover that Mossman is a Combine informant. Before they can stop her, she teleports herself and Eli back to City 17's Citadel. The Combine teleporter explodes as Gordon and Alyx use it to escape Nova Prospekt. \nUpon reaching Kleiner's lab, a shaken Dr. Kleiner reveals to Gordon and Alyx that they were caught in a \"slow teleport\", during which a week had passed. In their absence, the Resistance, who heard about what had happened at Nova Prospekt, has mobilized against the Combine, turning City 17 into a battleground.[28] During the fighting, Alyx is captured by the Combine and taken to the Citadel, and Gordon fights through the city with the aid of D0g and Barney to reach it. Inside the Citadel, he is caught in a Combine confiscation chamber that destroys all of his weapons except for the Gravity Gun, the energy enhancing its capabilities and allowing Gordon to escape and dispatch platoons of Combine soldiers. \nEventually, Gordon is captured riding in a Combine transport pod and is taken to Dr. Breen's office, where he and Dr. Mossman are waiting with Eli and Alyx in captivity. Dr. Breen begins to explain his plans for further conquest of the humans by the Combine, contrary to what he had told Dr. Mossman. Angered, Mossman frees Gordon, Alyx, and Eli before Breen teleports them off-world. Dr. Breen tries to escape through a portal, but Gordon pursues him and destroys the portal reactor with the super-charged Gravity Gun. Breen appears to be annihilated in the resulting explosion. Just before Gordon and Alyx are presumably met with a similar fate, time is frozen. The G-Man reappears, praising Gordon for his actions in City 17 and the Citadel. Making vague mention of \"offers for [Gordon's] services\", the G-Man places him back into stasis.","collection":35,"rating":92.1276965980629,"popularity":15.66666666666667,"aggregated_rating":91.0,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":91.56384829903143,"total_rating_count":1051,"rating_count":1043,"games":[6739,231,673,9509,25657,1011,559,37016,1871,1595],"tags":[1,18,19,268435461,536870915,536870917,536871365,536871378,536871452,536871517,536871882,536872001,536872032,536872070,536872315,536872334,536872898,536873111,536873544,536873874,536874694,536874843,536875058,536875484,536875537,536875572,536875574,536875624,536875769,536875787,536875819,536875830,536875840,536875856,536875868,536876385,536876454,536876563,536876685,536876687,536876690,536876706,536876712,536876922,536876933,536877049,536877264,536877306,536877532,536877533,536877647,536877654,536877976,536878004,536878467,536879233,536880100,536880137,536880203,536880732,536880786,536880893,536880894,536880897,536880903,536881364,536881584,536881668,536882492,536883071,536883081,536884386,536885515,536886534,536886566,1073741825],"developers":[56],"publishers":[24,56],"game_engines":[3],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":34200,"normally":51774,"completely":99000},"player_perspectives":[1],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[3,5,453,466,540,605,970,1089,1120,1158,1403,1422,1986,2199,2632,2962,3782,3931,4146,4572,4625,4660,4662,4712,4857,4875,4907,4918,4928,4944,4956,5473,5542,5651,5773,5775,5778,5794,5800,6010,6021,6137,6352,6394,6620,6621,6735,6742,7064,7092,7555,8321,9188,9225,9291,9820,9874,9981,9982,9985,9991,10452,10672,10756,11580,12159,12169,13474,14603,15622,15654],"themes":[1,18,19],"genres":[5],"standalone_expansions":[70647,26795],"first_release_date":1100563200000,"pulse_count":41,"platforms":[6,14,11,9,12,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1100563200000,"region":1,"human":"2004-Nov-16","y":2004,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1133481600000,"region":5,"human":"2005-Dec-02","y":2005,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1132272000000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Nov-18","y":2005,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1192752000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Oct-19","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1193270400000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Oct-25","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1211414400000,"region":5,"human":"2008-May-22","y":2008,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1197590400000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Dec-14","y":2007,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1198108800000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Dec-20","y":2007,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1368057600000,"region":8,"human":"2013-May-09","y":2013,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1274832000000,"region":8,"human":"2010-May-26","y":2010,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1100563200000,"region":2,"human":"2004-Nov-16","y":2004,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1132012800000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Nov-15","y":2005,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1191974400000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Oct-10","y":2007,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1197331200000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Dec-11","y":2007,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1197331200000,"region":7,"human":"2007-Dec-11","y":2007,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1191888000000,"region":7,"human":"2007-Oct-09","y":2007,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"HL2","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ga0lj5zqeqd7moyzxij9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ga0lj5zqeqd7moyzxij9","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mpphkihhk8yh9m2zaafd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mpphkihhk8yh9m2zaafd","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nnlfbf8blflrlmuarfej.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nnlfbf8blflrlmuarfej","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/muyxb9cljgsy245fcimx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"muyxb9cljgsy245fcimx","width":1024,"height":576},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iau5t12jemoelx0xuzna.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iau5t12jemoelx0xuzna","width":1024,"height":640}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"ID1dWN3n7q4"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/obcjdcsaq2ndxqi7zqdf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"obcjdcsaq2ndxqi7zqdf","width":355,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The

is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of military operatives tasked with thwarting the plans of a terrorist leader. Players complete mission objectives and engage in battles that take place in modern-day locations across the globe (e.g., United States, Great Britain, Germany). Players use pistols, rifles, machine guns, and explosives to injure/kill enemies; the frenetic conflicts are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood from injured characters. Blood-splatter effects appear often in the surrounding environment, in addition to dead bodies lying in pools of blood. Some sequences depict more intense acts of violence, such as a defenseless prisoner getting lit on fire; a man losing his arm from a sniper shot (with blood spurting from the wound); and a family dying (off-screen) in an explosion. In some instances, scattered packages of drugs appear in the environment (e.g., packets of narcotics that explode in white puffs when shot); in multiplayer mode, players can also unlock an emblem that resembles a cannabis leaf. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.callofduty.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/42680"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/callofduty"},{"category":6,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/callofduty"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/Callofduty"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_3"},{"category":2,"url":"http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Modern_Warfare_3"}],"external":{"steam":"115300"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":12,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":2,"onlinecoopmax":2,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":500,"name":"Batman: Arkham Asylum","slug":"batman-arkham-asylum","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum","created_at":1301478981000,"updated_at":1541578065523,"summary":"Using a great variety of gadgets you must make your way around the island, and the asylums halls to find and stop the joker. The game uses a 3-button combat system, but with a great number of gadget abilites which Batman can unlock. This makes for a very cinematic combat experience when fighting the Joker's goons.","storyline":"The Joker, Batman's arch enemy, has instigated an elaborate plot from within Arkham Asylum, where many of Batman's other foes have been incarcerated. Batman investigates and comes to learn that the Joker is trying to create an army of Bane-like creatures to threaten Gotham City, and is forced to put a stop to the Joker's plans. Throughout the night, Batman is forced to deal with the temporarily admitted sane prisoners from Blackgate prison, Scarecrow, Zsasz, Poison Ivy, Bane, Killer Croc and Harley Quinn. By the night's end, all the villains, save Bane, Croc and Crane, are recaptured and placed back in their cells and what remains of the staff try putting the Asylum back in order. Though it is thanks to Batman that the criminally insane are brought back under control, administrator of Arkham, mayoral candidate Quincy Sharp, soon takes advantage and claims the credit himself for bringing the Arkham institution back under control.","collection":68,"franchise":5,"franchises":[5],"rating":88.18930403355299,"popularity":24.0,"aggregated_rating":89.4,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":88.7946520167765,"total_rating_count":860,"rating_count":852,"games":[501,5503,2933,19565,2003,1266,3025,1267,128,19561],"tags":[1,23,268435481,268435487,536870926,536870934,536871019,536871127,536871382,536871877,536871939,536871944,536871945,536872371,536872393,536872406,536872883,536873810,536874452,536874552,536875011,536875047,536875157,536875222,536875257,536875418,536875432,536875453,536875492,536875537,536875638,536875764,536875809,536875819,536875889,536875934,536876007,536876171,536876235,536876487,536876570,536876757,536876763,536876826,536876929,536876978,536877032,536877075,536877239,536877495,536877533,536878246,536878247,536878249,536878250,536878263,536878264,536878586,536879992,536879993,536879994,536880353,536884867,536888127,536893368,536893369,1073741826],"developers":[164],"publishers":[4,50,26,23,3989],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":40860,"normally":56057,"completely":66600},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,22,107,215,470,965,1027,1032,1033,1459,1481,1494,1971,2898,3540,3640,4099,4135,4245,4310,4345,4506,4520,4541,4580,4625,4726,4852,4897,4907,4977,5022,5095,5259,5323,5575,5658,5845,5851,5914,6017,6066,6120,6163,6327,6583,6621,7334,7335,7337,7338,7351,7352,7674,9080,9081,9082,9441,13955,17215,22456,22457],"themes":[1,23],"genres":[25,31],"dlcs":[26112,26113,25993,26114,25991,26111],"first_release_date":1251158400000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[6,14,9,12,72],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1263427200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Jan-14","y":2010,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1251417600000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Aug-28","y":2009,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1251158400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Aug-25","y":2009,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1251158400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Aug-25","y":2009,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1252972800000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Sep-15","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1251417600000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Aug-28","y":2009,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1251936000000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Sep-03","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1251936000000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Sep-03","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1253232000000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Sep-18","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1253232000000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Sep-18","y":2009,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1320278400000,"region":8,"human":"2011-Nov-03","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1263427200000,"region":5,"human":"2010-Jan-14","y":2010,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1251676800000,"region":7,"human":"2009-Aug-31","y":2009,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":72,"date":1401235200000,"region":8,"human":"2014-May-28","y":2014,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Batman:

Hugo Strange discloses his knowledge of Wayne's dual identity as Batman before releasing him into the prison's criminal populace. While Strange prepares to commence \"Protocol 10\", Wayne obtains his equipment via airdrop from Alfred Pennyworth, allowing him to become Batman. He first saves Catwoman from being executed by Two-Face, who hopes to gain respect by murdering her. After Joker attempts to assassinate Catwoman, Batman tracks him to his hideout in the Sionis Steelmill, believing Joker may know the truth behind Protocol 10. \n \nThere, Batman learns that the unstable properties of the Titan formula are mutating in Joker's blood, gradually killing him. Joker captures Batman and performs a blood transfusion on him, infecting him with the same fatal disease. Joker also reveals that Gotham hospitals have been poisoned with his infected blood. Desperate to save himself and innocent citizens, Batman seeks out Mr. Freeze, who had been developing a cure but has since been kidnapped by the Penguin. \n \nTracking Penguin to the Cyrus Pinkney National History Institute, Batman defeats his forces, his imprisoned monster Solomon Grundy, and ultimately the Penguin himself, before liberating Mr. Freeze. Freeze tells Batman that he has already developed the cure, but its instability renders it useless. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure. Batman tracks one of Ra's al Ghul's assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze is able to develop an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it. \n \nWhen he returns to the Joker, Batman finds him restored to health. While the two fight, Strange activates Protocol 10, which is revealed to be a scheme to wipe out the entire population of Arkham City and destroy the criminal element of Gotham. The TYGER troops begin executing inmates as Strange launches missile strikes on Arkham's denizens from his base in Wonder Tower. A missile hits the steelmill, burying Batman under rubble. Before Joker can take advantage of the situation, Talia arrives and offers him immortality in exchange for sparing Batman's life. After escaping with the help of Catwoman, Batman is convinced by Alfred to end Protocol 10 before pursuing Talia and Joker. \n \nBatman infiltrates Wonder Tower and disables Protocol 10. Ra's al Ghul is revealed to be the true mastermind behind Arkham City and mortally wounds Strange for failing to defeat Batman. With his dying breath, Strange activates \"Protocol 11\", the self-destruction of Wonder Tower. Batman and Ra's escape, but Ra's commits suicide rather than risk capture. Joker contacts Batman, threatening to kill Talia unless Batman meets him at the Monarch Theater. Once Batman arrives, Joker demands the cure but is stabbed and apparently killed by Talia while distracted. Talia admits to stealing the cure from Quinn, when she is killed by a second Joker, still stricken with the disease. The healthy Joker that Talia stabbed then reanimates into the shapeshifting Clayface, who is revealed to have been masquerading as a healthy Joker all along at the ailing villain's request. \n \nBatman incapacitates Clayface, but Joker blows up the theater floor, sending Batman plummeting into Ra's' lair below. Batman destroys Ra's' rejuvenating Lazarus Pit before the Joker can use it, and drinks a portion of the antidote. Batman debates curing his foe but is attacked by Joker before he can act, causing the antidote vial to inadvertently smash. Batman admits that in spite of everything Joker had done, he would have saved him. After Joker finally succumbs to his illness and dies, Batman carries his body out of Arkham City. As Commissioner Gordon asks what happened, Batman places Joker's body on the hood of a police car and leaves in silence.","collection":68,"franchise":5,"franchises":[5],"rating":87.0781913035993,"popularity":25.33333333333333,"aggregated_rating":91.2,"aggregated_rating_count":13,"total_rating":89.13909565179965,"total_rating_count":766,"rating_count":753,"games":[500,5503,2933,19565,2003,77258,1266,8263,128,1270],"tags":[1,23,38,268435460,268435481,268435487,536870926,536870934,536870973,536871127,536871139,536871208,536871382,536871889,536871894,536871944,536871945,536872315,536872393,536873299,536873327,536873712,536873771,536873810,536874094,536874452,536874745,536874947,536875011,536875046,536875047,536875073,536875099,536875106,536875157,536875178,536875222,536875271,536875358,536875363,536875422,536875432,536875453,536875537,536875638,536875764,536875809,536875819,536875832,536875889,536875934,536876007,536876171,536876235,536876487,536876499,536876528,536876546,536876600,536876763,536876978,536877075,536877363,536877390,536877560,536877654,536877694,536877764,536877890,536878245,536878246,536878247,536878250,536878256,536878264,536878423,536879879,536879992,536880353,536880360,536880795,536880865,536892037,536892038,1073741826],"developers":[164],"publishers":[50,23],"game_engines":[351],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":43560,"normally":83560,"completely":186300},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[14,22,61,215,227,296,470,977,982,1032,1033,1403,1481,2387,2415,2800,2859,2898,3182,3540,3833,4035,4099,4134,4135,4161,4187,4194,4245,4266,4310,4359,4446,4451,4510,4520,4541,4625,4726,4852,4897,4907,4920,4977,5022,5095,5259,5323,5575,5587,5616,5634,5688,5851,6066,6163,6451,6478,6648,6742,6782,6852,6978,7333,7334,7335,7338,7344,7352,7511,8967,9080,9441,9448,9883,9953,21125,21126],"themes":[1,23,38],"genres":[4,25,31],"expansions":[18442],"dlcs":[75545,26116,75542,75544,75543],"first_release_date":1318896000000,"pulse_count":2,"platforms":[6,14,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1322006400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Nov-23","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1319155200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Oct-21","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1318896000000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Oct-18","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1321920000000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Nov-22","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1318896000000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Oct-18","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1318982400000,"region":3,"human":"2011-Oct-19","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1318982400000,"region":3,"human":"2011-Oct-19","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1319155200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Oct-21","y":2011,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1322179200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Nov-25","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1322006400000,"region":3,"human":"2011-Nov-23","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1355356800000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Dec-13","y":2012,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1322006400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Nov-23","y":2011,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1318896000000,"region":7,"human":"2011-Oct-18","y":2011,"m":10}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Batman:

is an action-adventure game featuring characters from the Batman franchise. Players assume the role of Batman as he investigates Arkham City, a neighborhood overrun by psychopathic criminals and former prison inmates. As players explore the city and infiltrate hideouts, they punch and kick criminals in melee-style combat, using various gadgets (e.g., explosive gel, smoke pellets, a grappling gun) to defend themselves against gun-wielding thugs and villains. The frenetic combat is highlighted by cries of pain, punching sounds, realistic gunfire, and slow-motion effects. In some sequences, players must solve puzzles or use stealth to incapacitate enemies and free hostages; when players fail a challenge, the hostage will lose his life. Some environments contain bloodstains on the floor or furniture; other cutscenes depict spots of blood on injured characters. During the course of the game, some female characters are dressed in form-fitting outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; one background sign depicts the silhouette of a woman and the words “Live Nude.” The dialogue also contains some suggestive references (e.g., “The anger, the frustration, the hints of repressed sexual tension” and “Sure could go for some porn right now.”). One sequence depicts a character smoking a cigar, and there are various references to alcohol (e.g., “She got a little drunk and killed her classmates,” “I'd give anything for a nice cold beer right now.”). The words “b*tch,” “a*s,” and “bastard” can be heard in dialogue.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains:

is a collection of action games in which players follow the story of characters from the Metal Gear Solid franchise. Players assume the role of elite soldiers through counter terrorist and military missions, using pistols, machine guns, and rocket launchers to kill various enemies (e.g., human soldiers, giant robots). Players can also employ close-up stealth attacks (e.g., choking and slitting throats from behind) to defeat enemies. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects (blood also stains the ground). Some games allow non-adversary characters/prisoners to be injured or killed; cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: enemy soldiers executed at point-blank range; a restrained character beaten during an interrogation. A comic-book-style sequence (hand-drawn still images) depicts a young character using a knife to execute captured soldiers. Some games in the collection include suggestive/sexual material: a man briefly groping a character's breasts; a male character's buttocks exposed as he runs through levels. In some sequences, players can enter a cardboard box (\"Love Pack\") to engage in sexual acts with another character—there is no depiction of the sexual acts, though moaning sounds occur. Players also have the ability to unlock a “Snake Beater” award after repeatedly zooming in on a picture of a woman in lingerie. A handful of sequences include depictions of bathroom humor (e.g., a character defecating inside his pants; a character urinating off a platform onto another character). The game includes references to drugs in the dialogue (e.g., “The biggest cocaine consume in the world is the United States\" and \"How'd he get the cocaine?\").

this open-world action game, players assume the role of three criminals whose storylines intersect within the fictional city of Los Santos. Players can switch between each character to follow his storyline, completing missions which often include criminal activities (e.g., stealing cars, executing heists, assassinating targets). Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill various enemies (e.g., rival gang members); players also have the ability to shoot non-adversary civilians, though this may negatively affect players' progress as a penalty system triggers a broad police search. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and the game contains rare depictions of dismemberment.  In one sequence, players are directed to use various instruments and means (e.g., pipe wrench, tooth removal, electrocution) to extract information from a character; the sequence is intense and prolonged, and it involves some player interaction (i.e., responding to on-screen prompts). The game includes depictions of sexual material/activity: implied fellatio and masturbation; various sex acts that the player's character procures from a prostitute—while no nudity is depicted in these sequences, various sexual moaning sounds can be heard. Nudity is present, however, primarily in two settings: a topless lap dance in a strip club and a location that includes male cult members with exposed genitalia in a non-sexual context. Within the game, TV programs and radio ads contain instances of mature humor: myriad sex jokes; depictions of raw sewage and feces on a worker's body; a brief instance of necrophilia (no nudity is depicted). Some sequences within the larger game allow players to use narcotics (e.g., smoking from a bong, lighting a marijuana joint); cocaine use is also depicted. Players' character can, at various times, consume alcohol and drive while under the influence. The words “f**k,”“c*nt,” and “n**ger” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/RockstarGames"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/rockstargames"},{"category":6,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/rockstargames"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/RockstarGames"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/grandtheftautoV"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V"},{"category":2,"url":"http://gta.wikia.com/Grand_Theft_Auto_V"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.rockstargames.com/V/"}],"external":{"steam":"271590"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":30,"offlinemax":0},{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":16,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":732,"name":"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas","slug":"grand-theft-auto-san-andreas","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas","created_at":1317748966000,"updated_at":1541578373567,"summary":"Returning after his mother's murder to the semi-fictional city of Los Santos (based on Los Angeles), Carl Johnson, a former gang banger, must take back the streets for his family and friends by gaining respect and once again gaining control over the city.

is an 'open-world' action-adventure game in which players assume the role of John Marston, a reformed criminal on a mission to capture the remnants of his old outlaw gang. Players roam Wild West environments and perform various missions for criminal figures and law enforcement: destroying bridges, helping individuals in distress, delivering packages of drugs (e.g., opium), capturing outlaws, and eliminating rival figures. Players use shotguns, pistols, and rifles to kill enemies in realistic gun battles. Players can engage in melee-style hand-to-hand combat and trigger slow-motion effects by shooting enemies at close-range or by targeted shooting (i.e., aiming for body parts). Blood often spurts out of characters when shot; head shots and knife attacks result in much larger sprays. In one sequence, a bloodied and mutilated corpse can be seen hanging from the rafters of a barn. Players have the ability to shoot pedestrians in the game; however, a 'Wanted Level'-penalty system discourages these acts by triggering a law enforcement response. The game contains a scene in which two characters have sex on a table; there is a brief instance of female nudity. One sequence depicts a man injecting himself with a syringe filled with cocaine.

is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of an undead fighter in the realm of Drangleic. Players traverse dungeon-like settings and battle a variety of fantastical enemies (e.g., ghouls, zombies, skeletons, giant rats) to gain souls. Players use knives, swords, and arrows to defeat enemies. Combat is highlighted by cries of pain and small splashes of blood. Some locations depict instances of blood and gore: a giant snake boss holding its severed head; a giant boss creature composed of hundreds of corpses; dead ogres near a pool of blood; a torture device with streaks of blood. During the course of the game, a boss creature appears partially topless (e.g. hair barely covering breasts).

Duncan can sense the influence of an Archdemon, a god-like being hosted in the body of a powerful Dragon that commands the Darkspawn, which means that this would be the first true Blight in over 400 years. It is of utmost importance that this Blight is ended before it can gain momentum, as previous Blights have left Thedas all but in ruins.","collection":10,"rating":87.5926302682741,"popularity":19.0,"aggregated_rating":90.2,"aggregated_rating_count":14,"total_rating":88.89631513413705,"total_rating_count":552,"rating_count":538,"games":[78,1887,478,1593,73,2933,75,80,22387,498],"tags":[1,17,268435468,536871059,536871139,536871208,536871244,536871390,536871504,536871758,536871938,536872225,536872371,536872435,536872626,536872798,536872799,536872978,536873066,536873718,536873949,536874136,536874552,536875050,536875281,536875372,536875398,536875432,536875531,536875638,536875735,536875764,536875774,536875779,536875791,536875830,536875889,536875935,536875937,536876007,536876235,536876286,536876392,536876476,536876545,536876585,536876969,536877032,536877209,536877383,536877965,536878072,536878267,536878382,536878423,536878512,536878610,536879062,536879106,536880547,536882924,536883649,536883846,536885222,536888127,536888363,536893175,536893176,1073741826,1073741827],"developers":[2],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[75],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":227557,"completely":279000},"player_perspectives":[2,3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[147,227,296,332,478,592,846,1026,1313,1459,1523,1714,1886,1887,2066,2154,2806,3037,3224,3640,4138,4369,4460,4486,4520,4619,4726,4823,4852,4862,4867,4879,4918,4977,5023,5025,5095,5323,5374,5480,5564,5633,5673,6057,6120,6297,6471,7053,7160,7355,7470,7511,7600,7698,8150,8194,9635,12012,12737,12934,14310,17215,17451,22263,22264],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"expansions":[77],"dlcs":[17466,17464,17465,17462,22963,22975],"first_release_date":1257206400000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[6,14,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1296086400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Jan-27","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1258675200000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-20","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1257206400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-03","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1257206400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-03","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1261353600000,"region":8,"human":"2009-Dec-21","y":2009,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1257206400000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-03","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1257379200000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Nov-05","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1257379200000,"region":3,"human":"2009-Nov-05","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1257465600000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-06","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1257465600000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-06","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1296086400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Jan-27","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1296086400000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Jan-27","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1416355200000,"region":3,"human":"2014-Nov-19","y":2014,"m":11}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"DAO"},{"name":"Dragon

is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of mythical warriors through missions and battles in the ravaged lands of Ferelden. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person role-playing games where the user does not usually have direct control over combat moves. Instead, players select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, dragon, bear, etc.) and an action (e.g., \"attack,\"\"kill,\" and magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage by emitting splashes of red blood; pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. The most intense instances of violence occur when players have the option to kill non-combatant civilians: A prisoner can be stabbed to death in order to steal a key; a merchant who overcharges refugees can be slashed in the throat; and a boy possessed by an evil demon can be killed off-screen. During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select \"Surprise me,\" they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features  human  nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts. Some profanity (e.g., \"sh*t,\"\"b*tch,\" and \"a*s\") can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Sexual violence.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://dragonage.bioware.com/"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/17450"},{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/dragonageofficial"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/dragonagegame"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/dragonage"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Origins"},{"category":2,"url":"http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Origins"}],"external":{"steam":"17450"}},{"id":75,"name":"Mass Effect 3","slug":"mass-effect-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mass-effect-3","created_at":1298019712000,"updated_at":1541423747333,"summary":"Earth is burning.

is an action role-playing game in which players assume the role of a space commander attempting to save humanity from a galaxy-wide threat. As players interact with myriad characters (e.g., developing alliances and relationships), they use machine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, and futuristic weapons to kill humans and alien creatures in frenetic combat. Enemies sometimes emit splashes of blood when hit; some sequences depict bloodstained characters or environments. Cutscenes depict other instances of violence: an alien shooting herself in the head with a pistol; a character getting impaled by a creature's claws. As the game progresses, the storyline sometimes references sexual material (e.g., “When this is over, I'm getting laid” and “Were oil and lubricants involved? Was there moaning?”). Players can also initiate brief romantic encounters between characters: dialogue choices are made, leading to kissing and caressing on a bed—sexual activity is implied. In one of these sequences, an alien character's buttocks and breasts are briefly depicted. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/biowaremasseffect"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/masseffect"},{"category":6,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/masseffect"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/masseffect"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_3"},{"category":2,"url":"http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3"},{"category":1,"url":"http://masseffect.bioware.com/"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":6,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]}]
