Players watch events as they unfold and make decisions that affect the storyline. A handful of still-image sequences depict acts of violence: soldiers in firefights; a woman shot in the head; a character stabbed in the chest. Violence is also described in text (e.g., “Fresh blood flew out of the man's head, and his body was blown away as if it has been hit by a truck,” and “An instant later, the knife slit his throat and ended his life.”). Blood is frequently depicted on characters' bodies and around corpses; large blood stains can bee seen on the ground. The game contains some suggestive innuendo and references in the dialogue (e.g., \"'They look bigger when I'm not wearing clothes. They're huge'\" and \"Everything about her was small. I could kind of make out a few of the curves that don't appear until after puberty...\"). There are also brief instances of nudity (i.e., partially exposed breasts and buttocks). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Strong

The first game follows the journey of the teenager Tidus who is transported to the world of Spira after an encounter with a creature known as Sin. He becomes one of the guardians of the summoner Yuna, protecting her on a pilgrimage to defeat Sin and finding out how the creature is linked to Tidus' and Yuna's late fathers.[7][8] Gameplay relies on the Conditional Turn-Based Battle system that allows for swapping party members in mid-combat. Characters are leveled up by means of the Sphere Grid on which the player may choose a specific skill to learn or attribute to improve.[9] The second game is set two years after the events of X and features Yuna as a treasure hunter in search of spheres leading her to Tidus.[10] It reintroduces the series' classic job system in the form of the Garment Grid: jobs can be acquired as dresspheres, costumes that give the player characters different abilities, throughout the game and may be changed in battle.[11] X-2 includes multiple minigames such as Sphere Break and blitzball, the latter of which also featured prominently in X.[12] \nWhile the majority of the gameplay for X and X-2 remains unchanged, the games have undergone an extensive graphical update and a large amount of the music for X has been rearranged. All regional releases contain content from the International versions: X has the expert Sphere Grid and several optional bosses, while X-2 comes with extra dresspheres and new minigames. The Creature Creator system was added, whereby players can capture enemy monsters and certain non-player characters (NPCs) to train them and to have them fight alongside the party in battle, similar to the Pokémon series: these captured allies can also be fought and strengthened in a coliseum. Lastly, X-2 includes the \"Last Mission\" extra dungeon that plays in the style of a roguelike 3D game, having a grid-based layout across which the characters move and take on enemies. Layouts are generated randomly and each opponent is allowed as many turns as the player has taken. As in the main game, the player characters can equip jobs in the form of dresspheres. Dialogue between the protagonists changes depending on which ending the player achieved in X-2. The Eternal Calm movie that bridges the gap between X and X-2 is included in the collection as well.[4][13][14][15][16][17] The collection allows for cross-platform saving between the PlayStation 3 (PS3) and PlayStation Vita versions and both games have full trophy support.[14][18] \nFinal Fantasy X: Will is an original audio drama included in the release, playing during the ending credits.[19] It features multiple characters from the games, alongside two new characters: the narrator Chuami and her companion Kurgum.[20] In the story, the two are sent to summon Yuna to investigate a mysterious phenomenon known as \"Beckoning\", where the dead are being called back into existence. On their journey, they encounter a reborn Sin, who has apparently been beckoned.[21][22] Over the course of the story, it is revealed that Tidus is suffering from some kind of weakness,[23] and that Yuna and he appear to have broken up and Yuna is seeing someone else.[24] The drama ends with Yuna preparing to face Sin again and Tidus, despite his weakness, deciding to follow her.","storyline":"The story begins with the main protagonist, Tidus, waiting with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. Tidus narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline. It begins in Tidus's home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned star of the underwater sport blitzball. During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature which Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\". Sin destroys Zanarkand, taking Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira. \nUpon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers in the area. Upon asking him where he is from, one of them, Rikku, tells him that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago. After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team.Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin; and her guardians, Lulu and Kimahri. Meanwhile, Tidus joins to help Wakka in the upcoming blitzball tournament to find a way back home. The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its \"offspring\"—fiends called Sinspawn. After the tournament, they are joined by Auron, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna's guardian. He reveals to Tidus that Yuna's father, Lord Braska; Tidus's father, Jecht; and himself made the same pilgrimage to defeat Sin ten years ago. Tidus thought his father had died at sea ten years earlier. Following another attack from Sin, they are joined by Rikku, later revealed to be Yuna's cousin. \nWhen the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado, Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira's sorrow. At Macalania Temple, the group sees a message from Seymour's father Jyscal, who declares he was killed by his son, who now aims to destroy Spira. The group reunites with Yuna to engage Seymour in battle, killing him;[36] soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna from the others. While searching for her on Bikanel Island, the homeland of the Al Bhed where they had surfaced, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive. The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour. They crash the wedding and escape with Yuna. The group is captured at the Bevelle temple, and are ordered to stand trial. After escaping from their sentence, the group heads towards the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game. \nOn the way there, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people. Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated. Zanarkand's survivors became \"fayth\" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira. One thousand years after its creation, the fayth have become exhausted from \"dreaming\" their Zanarkand, but are unable to stop due to Sin's influence. \nOnce they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. Yuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn. Disappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon. After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to battle Seymour and Jecht's imprisoned spirits. With Sin's hosts defeated, Tidus' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon. Sin's cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane, having died years ago after confronting Yunalesca. Just then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water. He then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.","collection":39,"franchise":4,"franchises":[4],"rating":86.1620334795942,"popularity":5.0,"aggregated_rating":86.8235294117647,"aggregated_rating_count":17,"total_rating":86.49278144567944,"total_rating_count":40,"rating_count":23,"games":[2933,1887,418,4756,55092,22387,2449,14394,7275,1802],"tags":[17,268435468,268435471,536871208,536871475,536871872,536871938,536872626,536872983,536873154,536873384,536875046,536875281,536875426,536875823,536875895,536875910,536876007,536876211,536876217,536876219,536876226,536876235,536876240,536876241,536876242,536876306,536876323,536876329,536876486,536876647,536876650,536876816,536876817,536876850,536876875,536876901,536876982,536877029,536877284,536877303,536877560,536877598,536877984,536878024,536878097,536878127,536878379,536878380,536878381,536878382,536878383,536878384,536893876,536893877,1073741826],"developers":[26,794],"publishers":[45,26],"category":3,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[296,563,960,1026,1714,2071,2242,2472,4134,4369,4514,4911,4983,4998,5095,5299,5305,5307,5314,5323,5328,5329,5330,5394,5411,5417,5574,5735,5738,5904,5905,5938,5963,5989,6070,6117,6372,6391,6648,6686,7072,7112,7185,7215,7467,7468,7469,7470,7471,7472,22964,22965],"themes":[17],"genres":[12,15],"first_release_date":1388016000000,"pulse_count":6,"platforms":[6,46,9,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1431648000000,"region":1,"human":"2015-May-15","y":2015,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1431388800000,"region":2,"human":"2015-May-12","y":2015,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1463011200000,"region":8,"human":"2016-May-12","y":2016,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1388016000000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Dec-26","y":2013,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1388016000000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Dec-26","y":2013,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1395100800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Mar-18","y":2014,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1395100800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Mar-18","y":2014,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1395273600000,"region":3,"human":"2014-Mar-20","y":2014,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1395273600000,"region":3,"human":"2014-Mar-20","y":2014,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1395360000000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Mar-21","y":2014,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1395360000000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Mar-21","y":2014,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1431561600000,"region":5,"human":"2015-May-14","y":2015,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1431561600000,"region":3,"human":"2015-May-14","y":2015,"m":5}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Final

Which is a spin off series of the Shin Megami Tensei series. Starting with Persona 3, the series became popular for its combination of traditional RPG mechanics, and social simulation gameplay. By day the player attends high school. By night the game becomes a dungeon crawling turn based RPG. In Persona 4 the player assumes the role of the player-named protagonist who has transferred to a new school in the fictional rural Japanese town of Inaba. The protagonist gains the ability to summon Personas, a power that allows the protagonist to fight Shadows, the enemies of the game. \n \nLike Persona 3, Persona 4 requires the player to manage their time wisely. As most actions in the game will result in time advancing. Passage of time is not based on how long the player takes to do their actions. Once the player has chosen what they will do, time will pass. When time passes it simply skips to the next part of the day. Each day is split into multiple parts: Early Morning, Morning, Lunch, Daytime, Afternoon, After School, and the Evening. Players can choose to spend time with friends, study, read books, fish, and many other side activities. Note that shopping does not cause time to pass. \n \nOn schooldays the player attends school, where there is usually a lecture about random factoids of real life that you will be quizzed on. Getting these questions right or wrong does not effect the main story, but raises the characters Knowledge social stat, which can be used to unlock dialogue options in some cutscenes, and get higher test scores. Other social stats, include: Understanding, Courage, Expression, and Diligence. Each of these stats have many various effects on the players side activities. Some social links require certain levels of social stats. Increasing your social stats can unlock more part time jobs for the player to earn more money. After school and on weekends the player chooses what to do with their free time, \n \nAt night, the player can traverse dungeons. Where they will fight many different types of Shadows. The combat is very similar to any traditional turn based Japanese RPG game. Persona 4 uses a combat system akin to the Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne \"Press Turn\" system. In which the player can take advantage of the enemies weaknesses to gain extra turns. If the player attacks an enemy with an element that enemy is weak to, the player gains an extra turn to attack. However, repeating that attack on the same enemy will not give the character a second extra turn. \n \nThe game features a very complex but easy to use fusing system. The player selects multiple personas to fuse together to create a new persona that can sometimes carry over some of the base personas skills. Later into the game the player can unlock Special Fusions to create Peronas that are very powerful. \n \nSocial Links are one of the key mechanics in this game. Social Links are a measure of the friendship between the protagonist and the many characters of Persona 4. This feature gives your fused Personas bonus experience upon their creation, and allow you to learn new skills and abilities in battle. Social Links also open up romantic relationship options with a few of the games female characters. Social Links play out as the normal cutscenes in the game that provide more character development for the huge cast of characters. There are 24 Social Links in total, each one has a respective Arcana. All Personas have an assigned Arcana. Having a Persona of the same Arcana of a Social Link doubles the rate that you level that Social Link. \n \nPersona 4's plot is closely tied to the weather, thus the player can check the ingame weather forecast. Weather has various effects on the game, on rainy days if the player chooses to study they will gain more Knowledge points than normal. The most essential part of the weather forecast is recognizing when the town will become foggy, as this is an indication of when the player must finish the dungeon they are currently exploring.

The main character, Nariko, uses a weapon called the \"Heavenly Sword\" which changes into one of three forms depending on what attack stance the player uses as part of a unique fighting style. Speed Stance provides an even balance between damage and speed, where the sword takes the form of two separate blades. Range Stance allows fast, long-range, but weaker attacks, with the sword being two blades chained together. Power Stance is the most powerful, but slowest style, where attacks are made with the Sword in the shape of one large, two-handed blade.\n\nFor exploration and certain battles, the game also makes use of \"quick time events\" (QTE). During a QTE, a symbol for a certain button or for an action such as moving the analog stick to the right or left appears on screen and the player must match what is shown to successfully complete the scene.\n\nIn addition to Nariko, a secondary character, Kai, is controlled for some portions of the game. Many of Kai's stages take the form of sniping missions, using her crossbow to pick off enemies, in some cases to protect characters. While Kai cannot perform hand-to-hand combat, in stages that call for her to explore the level she is able to hop over objects and to free herself from an enemy's grasp by temporarily stunning them.\n\nProjectiles can be maneuvered to their targets using the motion-sensing capabilities of the SIXAXIS controller through a feature known as Aftertouch. Such projectiles include guiding Kai's arrows after she has launched them, and for Nariko, guiding a cannon or rocket launcher, or picking up and throwing objects.","storyline":"The game's story and mythos revolves around the titular Heavenly Sword, a blade said to have been wielded by an unnamed Heavenly deity against a demonic warlord called the Raven Lord. After the battle was won and the Raven Lord defeated, the sword was left in the mortal world, becoming the center of wars over its power. The fighting made the sword lust after the life of its users, eventually killing them after a short time. A warrior tribe finally took charge of the sword, ending the wars and pledging to keep it safe and unused for the world's own good. Among the tribe, a legend said that the sword's original wielder would be reborn in the year of the \"fire-horse\", and that this figure would unite the world's scattered tribes and lead the world to peace.","rating":79.2635121708459,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":88.0,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":83.63175608542295,"total_rating_count":28,"rating_count":22,"games":[7603,549,551,836,493,112,2437,3025,837,6958],"tags":[1,268435460,268435481,268435487,536871041,536871139,536871208,536871213,536871301,536871470,536872098,536872152,536872666,536872810,536873021,536873742,536873904,536874398,536874743,536874745,536875057,536875133,536875151,536875157,536875199,536875257,536875271,536875350,536875488,536875523,536875689,536875755,536875778,536875902,536876266,536876377,536876453,536876464,536876499,536876650,536876706,536876735,536876762,536876901,536876910,536876922,536876988,536877032,536877047,536877049,536877275,536877280,536877405,536877559,536877628,536877664,536877764,536877782,536878127,536878133,536878256,536878266,536879217,536879786,536880084,536880292,536880441,536880959,536881580,536882159,536882192,536882762,536882887,536883352,536883995,536884018,536884021,536885758,536887085],"developers":[795],"publishers":[334],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"normally":18000},"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[129,227,296,301,389,558,1186,1240,1754,1898,2109,2830,2992,3486,3831,3833,4145,4221,4239,4245,4287,4345,4359,4438,4576,4611,4777,4843,4866,4990,5354,5465,5541,5552,5587,5738,5794,5823,5850,5989,5998,6010,6076,6120,6135,6137,6363,6368,6493,6647,6716,6752,6852,6870,7215,7221,7344,7354,8305,8874,9172,9380,9529,10047,10668,11247,11280,11850,11975,12440,13083,13106,13109,14846,16173],"themes":[1],"genres":[4,25,31],"first_release_date":1189555200000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1195084800000,"region":5,"human":"2007-Nov-15","y":2007,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1189728000000,"region":1,"human":"2007-Sep-14","y":2007,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1189555200000,"region":2,"human":"2007-Sep-12","y":2007,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1190246400000,"region":3,"human":"2007-Sep-20","y":2007,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/azx2c3rwmfboier7iavk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"azx2c3rwmfboier7iavk","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vj9rpqegbw7x9dhbn6hr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vj9rpqegbw7x9dhbn6hr","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/diw3szqhwl0vkypfzh0z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"diw3szqhwl0vkypfzh0z","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/e7l58klvxxcsifqil5nf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"e7l58klvxxcsifqil5nf","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"hifSJWoTGPY"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/klytr5oxg56qi0dm8kaq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"klytr5oxg56qi0dm8kaq","width":250,"height":288},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"rating":4}},{"id":7458,"name":"The Sly Collection","slug":"the-sly-collection","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-sly-collection","created_at":1404075709063,"updated_at":1537844211107,"summary":"The Sly Collection features three PlayStation®2 action-packed classic hits: Sly Cooper and the Thievius Racconus, Sly 2: Band of Thieves and Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves fully remastered in high definition, and optimized for the PlayStation®Vita system. \n \nThe Sly Collection sees the mischievous raccoon and his gang of eccentric friends pull off daring heists in this entertaining platformer adventure.

is an open source indie platform video game created by Derek Yu and released as freeware for Microsoft Windows. It was remade for the Xbox 360 in 2012, with ports to the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and then back to Microsoft Windows. The player controls a spelunker who explores a series of caves while collecting treasure, saving damsels, fighting enemies and dodging traps. The caves are procedurally generated, making each run through the game unique. Spelunky is one of the first examples of a roguelike-like, borrowing concepts from the roguelike genre, and was the influence for many later roguelike-like games.","storyline":"Players control an unnamed adventurer, known as the spelunker. The aim of the game is to explore underground tunnels, gathering as much treasure as possible while avoiding traps and enemies. The spelunker can whip or jump on enemies to defeat them, pick up items that can be thrown to either attack enemies or set off traps, and use a limited supply of bombs and ropes to navigate the caves. Levels are randomly generated and grouped into four increasingly difficult \"areas\", each with a distinctive set of items, enemies, terrain types and special features. Later areas contain better treasures, secret locations, and items. However, if the player loses all their hearts or runs into an instant kill trap, they will have to start from the beginning. \n \n \nEnemies include animals like bats, snakes and spiders of varying sizes, other characters, and monsters like yeti, man-eating plants and ghosts. The player can collect many items, mainly gold and jewels which add to the player's score, but also useful objects including bombs, guns, climbing gear and archaeological artifacts. Some of the latter have supernatural abilities, including kapalas, hedjets, crystal skulls and golden ankhs, though many of these special items can only be gained through secret methods, like combining other items together. Some items may be purchased or stolen from shops scattered about the caves, though the shopkeeper becomes a powerful enemy if you steal from him. \n \n \nThe player can also encounter damsels in distress trapped in the caves, who can be picked up and carried to an exit. Successfully doing so returns health to the player. It's possible to unlock the damsel as a playable character; gameplay is identical, except that the player encounters spelunkers to rescue. Another unlockable character is the \"Tunnel Man\", who possesses a mattock instead of a whip. \n \n \nThe Xbox Live Arcade version of the game features local multiplayer (co-op and deathmatch) for up to four players. There are 9 different characters to play as. \n \n \nSpelunky also includes a level editor, in which players can create their own non-random levels to share with others.","collection":1083,"hypes":1,"rating":87.39692145249981,"popularity":4.333333333333334,"aggregated_rating":91.6666666666667,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":89.53179405958326,"total_rating_count":59,"rating_count":49,"games":[26658,25311,29032,28070,24426,31712,26145,47823,109287,37419],"tags":[1,17,21,268435464,268435471,268435487,268435488,536870984,536871032,536871328,536873494,536873810,536888127,536889368,536890732,536890733,536891356,1073741828],"developers":[1421],"publishers":[1010,1421],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":216000,"normally":324000,"completely":432000},"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[72,120,416,2582,2898,17215,18456,19820,19821,20444],"themes":[1,17,21],"genres":[8,15,31,32],"first_release_date":1341360000000,"pulse_count":7,"platforms":[45,6,36,46,9,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1377648000000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Aug-28","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1377561600000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Aug-27","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1412726400000,"region":3,"human":"2014-Oct-08","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1414022400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Oct-23","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1414022400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Oct-23","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1377648000000,"region":3,"human":"2013-Aug-28","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1377648000000,"region":3,"human":"2013-Aug-28","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1377648000000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Aug-28","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1377648000000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Aug-28","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1377561600000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Aug-27","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1377561600000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Aug-27","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1414022400000,"region":5,"human":"2014-Oct-23","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1412726400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Oct-08","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1412640000000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Oct-07","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1375920000000,"region":8,"human":"2013-Aug-08","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":36,"date":1341360000000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jul-04","y":2012,"m":7}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Spelunky HD"},{"name":"Spelunky Enhanced"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jcp8odbymhh6exidv1ev.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jcp8odbymhh6exidv1ev","width":960,"height":544},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iyydvheenwo5ftsb6dse.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iyydvheenwo5ftsb6dse","width":960,"height":544},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mwt9kanz0ahs755liln6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mwt9kanz0ahs755liln6","width":960,"height":544},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kmz2lzgrj4aijosc6ptf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kmz2lzgrj4aijosc6ptf","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/mrkcq2ahpvbunklcyqv2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"mrkcq2ahpvbunklcyqv2","width":640,"height":360}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"D1vCF-5Xkp4"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/liofidxnrdvb0lypfu8r.jpg","cloudinary_id":"liofidxnrdvb0lypfu8r","width":900,"height":1090},"esrb":{"rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 7 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards fantasy characters - Non realistic looking violence towards characters which although human are not very detailed","rating":2},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/239350/Spelunky"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelunky"},{"category":2,"url":"http://spelunky.wikia.com/wiki/Spelunky"},{"category":1,"url":"http://spelunkyworld.com/"}]},{"id":5619,"name":"Demon's Souls","slug":"demon-s-souls","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/demon-s-souls","created_at":1395656962126,"updated_at":1541175038964,"summary":"Set in a dark fantasy world, players take control of a hero who has journeyed to the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, which is being ravaged by a cursed fog that brings forth demons who feast on the souls of mortals.

is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players attempt to save the medieval kingdom of Boletaria from demons. Players manage a number of stats (e.g., strength, endurance, intelligence) and inventory items while battling humans, animals, and supernatural enemies. Players use melee weapons (swords and axes), bows for ranged attacks, and magical spells to kill an assortment of enemies (e.g., human soldiers, dogs and rats, giant insects, demons). Attacks usually result in large clouds of dark red blood; blood appears splattered on walls, floors, and around corpses in several environments. During one boss battle, blood continually spurts out of the wound of a demon's stomach and covers a large portion of the floor.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence -\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.demons-souls.com/"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon's_Souls"},{"category":2,"url":"http://demonssouls.wikia.com/wiki/Demon's_Souls"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":3,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":7444,"name":"Shovel Knight","slug":"shovel-knight","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/shovel-knight","created_at":1403875148108,"updated_at":1541174392903,"summary":"Shovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this land with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and quest for his lost beloved. He wields a Shovel Blade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly! \n \nBut, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost. If you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, humor and levity, and real heart… Shovel Knight is for you!","collection":3153,"rating":87.5958101648559,"popularity":17.66666666666667,"aggregated_rating":88.9473684210526,"aggregated_rating_count":20,"total_rating":88.27158929295425,"total_rating_count":234,"rating_count":214,"games":[3222,28952,19150,24426,14593,56033,18263,9806,7344,22387],"tags":[1,17,27,268435464,268435487,268435488,536871038,536871208,536871262,536871338,536871421,536871450,536872928,536872961,536873021,536873141,536873454,536874209,536874745,536875046,536875047,536875057,536875075,536875081,536875127,536875188,536875232,536875309,536875317,536875377,536875378,536875453,536875531,536875611,536875629,536875753,536875766,536875843,536875844,536875845,536875869,536875871,536875921,536875942,536876026,536876087,536876217,536876222,536876228,536876239,536876254,536876291,536876496,536876506,536876541,536876544,536876550,536876730,536876941,536877041,536877112,536877560,536878135,536878215,536878269,536878365,536878366,536878367,1073741828],"developers":[3087],"publishers":[3087],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":9600,"normally":27600,"completely":36000},"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[126,296,350,426,509,538,2016,2049,2109,2229,2542,3297,3833,4134,4135,4145,4163,4169,4215,4276,4320,4397,4405,4465,4466,4541,4619,4699,4717,4841,4854,4931,4932,4933,4957,4959,5009,5030,5114,5175,5305,5310,5316,5327,5342,5379,5584,5594,5629,5632,5638,5818,6029,6129,6200,6648,7223,7303,7357,7453,7454,7455],"themes":[1,17,27],"genres":[8,31,32],"expansions":[20027,23910,27241],"standalone_expansions":[27240],"first_release_date":1403740800000,"status":5,"pulse_count":34,"platforms":[45,6,14,41,46,9,48,49,3,37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1415145600000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Nov-05","y":2014,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1403740800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Jun-26","y":2014,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1433980800000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Jun-11","y":2015,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1403740800000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Jun-26","y":2014,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1429747200000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Apr-23","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1429574400000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Apr-21","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1429747200000,"human":"2015-Apr-23","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1403740800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jun-26","y":2014,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1403740800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jun-26","y":2014,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1403740800000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Jun-26","y":2014,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1410566400000,"human":"2014-Sep-13","y":2014,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1412726400000,"human":"2014-Oct-08","y":2014,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1429574400000,"human":"2015-Apr-21","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":46,"date":1429574400000,"human":"2015-Apr-21","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1429574400000,"human":"2015-Apr-21","y":2015,"m":4},{"category":0,"platform":49,"date":1430265600000,"human":"2015-Apr-29","y":2015,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Shovel

Swept into a frenzy by their tyrannical ruler, Scolar Visari, the Helghast forces attempted to seize control of Vekta’s capitol in a bloody blitzkrieg. Their initial attack was defeated by a small group of ISA peacekeeping forces. \n \nIn the months that followed, the ISA slowly succeeded in driving the remaining invaders off Vekta – but not before the retreating Helghast troops captured a powerful nuclear weapon. Refusing to fall victim to Visari’s plans of conquest ever again, the ISA decided to launch a full-scale planetary invasion of the Helghast home world. \n \nYou are Tomas ‘Sev’ Sevchenko, a special forces operative for the ISA. Along with the other members of Alpha Team – Rico, Garza and Natko – you are sent to planet Helghan to bring Scolar Visari to justice before he can use the nuclear weapon against its creators.

Several interspersed cutscenes depict characters being shot and killed and sometimes include small splashes of pixilated red blood. One sequence involves female characters wearing and discussing 'racy' bathing suits, while the camera pans and lingers on certain body parts. Another cutscene features a characters smoking a cigarette.

The organisation is dedicated to battling with the Negativitron and defeating it before it destroys Craftworld (Alternate name for game's environment).[7] After Sackboy passes the tests in Larry's Hideout, he tells him that they must get to Victoria Von Bathysphere's (Judy Sweeney[9]) Laboratory, since she has built a Sackbot army for the Alliance.","collection":238,"rating":80.7751212504023,"popularity":2.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":93.75,"aggregated_rating_count":8,"total_rating":87.26256062520115,"total_rating_count":65,"rating_count":57,"games":[24426,20342,55173,56033,19150,28070,33269,103339,19001,47823],"tags":[1,27,33,268435464,268435465,268435487,536871033,536871262,536872030,536872589,536872961,536873712,536873810,536874552,536876797,536878612,536879069,536881080,536893006,536893007,1073741828],"developers":[746],"publishers":[334],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[121,350,1118,1677,2049,2800,2898,3640,5885,7700,8157,10168,22094,22095],"themes":[1,27,33],"genres":[8,9,31],"dlcs":[24239],"first_release_date":1295308800000,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1295308800000,"region":2,"human":"2011-Jan-18","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1295395200000,"region":1,"human":"2011-Jan-19","y":2011,"m":1},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1297296000000,"region":5,"human":"2011-Feb-10","y":2011,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1295308800000,"human":"2011-Jan-18","y":2011,"m":1}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"LBP 2","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/f0nf0qwovarl7m9xhocc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"f0nf0qwovarl7m9xhocc","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/llxnfvw0kaw3bhhmlf8a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"llxnfvw0kaw3bhhmlf8a","width":562,"height":316},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/oact409tlmgncnz2yudc.jpg","cloudinary_id":"oact409tlmgncnz2yudc","width":1597,"height":893},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qt9fewoguu2gbqzkbevd.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qt9fewoguu2gbqzkbevd","width":1587,"height":895},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qf0uxenw2ftlizr3bqdu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qf0uxenw2ftlizr3bqdu","width":1591,"height":895}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"Ky-JUL0SDDs"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qi2hbbjcd6mp3sqcwooo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qi2hbbjcd6mp3sqcwooo","width":435,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a side-scrolling platformer game in which players help a small doll (Sackboy) traverse through whimsical environments.

In the first two instalments of the series, gameplay consisted primarily of traditional platforming like jumping and avoiding obstacles to successfully navigate to the end of a level to win. Since LittleBigPlanet 2, gameplay has expanded to being a \"platform for games\" with the introduction of numerous mini-games and other genres into the game diversifying the game from being strictly a traditional platforming game. Most LittleBigPlanet games involve a player playing solo or co-operatively with friends to navigate through a level whilst collecting various \"prize bubbles\" along the way. These prize bubbles come in two types, small ones which constitute points and larger ones that contain new costumes, stickers or other type of collectibles that can be used to customise Sackboy or in level creation. There are also numerous co-operative parts of levels whereby certain prize bubbles can only be collected with the help of at least one player or more depending on the number of players stated in the level.","collection":238,"rating":80.5770433772027,"popularity":5.0,"aggregated_rating":96.0,"aggregated_rating_count":12,"total_rating":88.28852168860135,"total_rating_count":122,"rating_count":110,"games":[20342,103339,19241,33269,109581,77349,19150,24426,37001,71628],"tags":[33,35,268435464,536872407,536872961,536873297,536874136,536877186,1073741828],"developers":[746],"publishers":[334],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":28800,"normally":360000,"completely":3600000},"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[1495,2049,2385,3224,6274],"themes":[33,35],"genres":[8],"first_release_date":1225065600000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[9,38],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1225065600000,"region":2,"human":"2008-Oct-27","y":2008,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1225843200000,"region":1,"human":"2008-Nov-05","y":2008,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1225324800000,"region":5,"human":"2008-Oct-30","y":2008,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1258416000000,"region":2,"human":"2009-Nov-17","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1258675200000,"region":1,"human":"2009-Nov-20","y":2009,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1259798400000,"region":5,"human":"2009-Dec-03","y":2009,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"LBP"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gwpjxrif3kqhhivjr9vi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gwpjxrif3kqhhivjr9vi","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/h90etyamftqfwceiv9yj.jpg","cloudinary_id":"h90etyamftqfwceiv9yj","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dsnad81ilzpvasvhiewg.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dsnad81ilzpvasvhiewg","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/plxpudiwbscamgzxohcn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"plxpudiwbscamgzxohcn","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sfrgcfc8ckhse7ztkko7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sfrgcfc8ckhse7ztkko7","width":1280,"height":720}],"artworks":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/eq0xrpakknghdxbw82zt.jpg","cloudinary_id":"eq0xrpakknghdxbw82zt","width":1000,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fywpb6tinih6wcfynszz.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fywpb6tinih6wcfynszz","width":1000,"height":700},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/sizwnhci1jgmaiu3mxwx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"sizwnhci1jgmaiu3mxwx","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kupe0irunyh9x5nsuv28.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kupe0irunyh9x5nsuv28","width":1000,"height":750},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/igwb81rwjdsyqvociutk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"igwb81rwjdsyqvociutk","width":750,"height":950},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iln1wqvmp59q2rak12ca.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iln1wqvmp59q2rak12ca","width":700,"height":980}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"AGzOKbVC2r8"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yyjpfswrrswp8plsypjl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yyjpfswrrswp8plsypjl","width":509,"height":600},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.littlebigplanet.com/"}],"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":9,"offlinecoop":true,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":true,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":true,"dropin":true,"offlinecoopmax":4,"onlinecoopmax":4,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0}]},{"id":380,"name":"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots","slug":"metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots","created_at":1300437356000,"updated_at":1541509849840,"summary":"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is a story-driven adventure game, with seasoned hero Solid Snake drafted for one final mission.

mask, kill everyone. Hotline Miami is a very fast paced two dimensional top-down shooter/slasher set in the 80s Miami, where you play as an unnamed character with the objective of ending everyones lives with different melee or ranged weapons while wearing an animal mask.

Players can explore ancient ruins in international locales while traversing 3D landscapes embedded with puzzles and traps. Along the way, players will encounter mercenaries/soldiers who will attack with realistic machine guns. Players can brawl with these mercenaries/soldiers, shoot back at them with pistols and rifles, or sneak up on the enemies to perform \"stealth kills\" (e.g., neck-snapping, choke-holds). During gunfights, brief splashes of blood are emitted from characters; more shots—and thus, more blood—are required to kill a growling ice beast. The action sequences are interspersed with cutscenes that are dramatic, but just as often, humorous in tone; a handful of them contain sexual/suggestive innuendo: \"Oh! Is that an ancient Tibetan ritual dagger in your pocket . . . Oh! Maybe I'm just happy to see you\" and \"Well, so much for foreplay . . .\" In one scene, a woman (fully clothed) straddles on top of the central character, places his hands on her hips (he drums his fingers), then kisses him as the camera pans away (to a painting above the bed). In the heat of battle  and  conversation, the words  sh*t ,  b*tch , and  a*s  are sometimes exclaimed.","rating":5},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence.\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncharted_2:_Among_Thieves"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.naughtydog.com/games/uncharted2_among_thieves/"}]},{"id":9927,"name":"Persona 5","slug":"persona-5","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/persona-5","created_at":1430168520169,"updated_at":1541560052141,"summary":"Persona 5 is a role-playing game developed by Atlus. It is chronologically the sixth installment in the Persona series, which is part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. Persona 5 is a role-playing game in which players live out a year in the life of a high school boy who gains the ability to summon facets of his psyche, known as Personas. Dungeon exploration features additional elements from previous iterations, such as jumping across gaps or dashing between cover. Dungeons feature a mixture of fixed environments tied into the plot and theme, and randomly generated environments. Battles are based on a turn-based attack system, with the characters wielding both their Personas and two weapon types: a gun and a melee weapon. The Social Link element from Persona 3 and 4 also returns in an altered form.","storyline":"The story focuses on the 16-year-old protagonist after he is transferred to Syujin High School in Tokyo, Japan. Staying with friends of his parents, he meets up with problem child Ryuji Sakamoto, the withdrawn Ann Takamaki, art student Yusuke Kitagawa, and a talking, shape-shifting cat-like creature known as Morgana. \n \nDuring the protagonist's time there, feeling suppressed by their environment, the five form a group known as the \"Phantom Thieves of Hearts\", working together to explore the

is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of a high-school student who enters an alternate world and uses special powers to change the hearts of people in the real world. As players explore themed areas of the “Metaverse,” they engage in turn-based combat against fantastical creatures (e.g., demons, evil spirits, shadow creatures). Characters use blades, pipes, firearms, and Personas (i.e., creatures that enable magical attacks) to defeat enemies; battles are highlighted by light effects, impact sounds, and cries of pain. Some cutscenes depict characters ripping masks off their faces as blood sprays. One cutscene depicts a man shooting another character in the head at close range; blood is shown pooling on the floor and splattering the victim's clothes. Several female monsters/Personas are depicted with exposed breasts, and a handful of creatures have phallic-shaped heads, torsos, or appendages. Various Personas (e.g., Succubus, Incubus) have sexual characteristics that are described in text (e.g., “They visit sleeping men/women and have sexual intercourse with them”); dialogue also includes sexual references (e.g., “Apparently he's been forcing young idols and other girls to have sex with him to move up in the ranks”). Drug smuggling for the mafia is briefly discussed during a side quest (e.g., “Like illegal drugs…? Maybe they made Iida smuggle drugs for them.”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"This game has been rated PEGI 16 for depictions of realistic looking violence towards human-like characters, use of sexual expletives, and encouragement/teaching of gambling.

As players explore various districts and follow the storyline, they engage in missions that often involve fistfights with thugs or rival gang members; characters can also use weapons such as bats during frenetic combat sequences. Players can perform scripted moves after building enough meter; these Heat Actions depict characters breaking necks, slamming heads into walls, and shoving bats inside enemies' mouths. Violence is often accompanied by gunfire, impact sounds, screams of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Cutscenes depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a bound man tortured with a sledgehammer; a character impaled by spikes. The game contains some sexual content: men groping women's breasts in a night club; a man guiding a woman's hand over his crotch. Players can also opt to visit parlors where they can flirt with women over the phone: close-up images of a bikini-clad woman are shown in the background. During the course of the game, players can order and drink whiskey at a bar—a status icon indicates drunkenness. Another sequence allows players' character to engage in a game of darts after consuming alcohol, as the screen blurs and shakes during play. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\n\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Violence towards defenceless people - Sexual violence - Strong language - Content that teaches or encourages gambling","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/638970/Yakuza_0"},{"category":1,"url":"http://ryu-ga-gotoku.com/zero/"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_0"},{"category":2,"url":"http://yakuza.wikia.com/wiki/Yakuza_0"}],"external":{"steam":"638970"}},{"id":1009,"name":"The Last of Us","slug":"the-last-of-us","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-of-us","created_at":1324332447922,"updated_at":1541582346886,"summary":"Twenty years after a mutated fungus started turning people all over the world into deadly zombies, humans become an endangered species. Joel, a Texan in his forties with the \"emotional range of a teaspoon\" (to quote Hermione from Harry Potter), finds himself responsible with the safety of a fourteen year old girl named Ellie whom he must smuggle to a militia group called the Fireflies. And as if the infected aren't enough of a hassle, they also have to deal with the authorities who wouldn't let them leave the quarantine zone, as well as other survivors capable of killing anyone who might have something useful in their backpacks.","storyline":"Joel, a ruthless survivor with few moral lines left to cross, lives in one of the last remaining Quarantine Zones. These walled-off, oppressive cities are run by what’s left of the military. Despite the strict martial law, Joel operates in the black market of the city, smuggling contraband for the right price. \n \nJoel is asked by a dying friend to look after Ellie, a fourteen-year-old girl with courage beyond her years. What starts out as a simple job to deliver Ellie to another Quarantine Zone, soon transforms into a profound journey that will forever change Joel and Ellie. \n \nAs they journey across a post-pandemic United States, Joel and Ellie will encounter different factions of survivors that have each found a unique way of dealing with the infected humans, the lack of supplies, and the threat of other survivors. As Joel and Ellie struggle to persevere, they must learn to trust each other and work together in order to survive the realities of this new world.","collection":864,"rating":95.1348237077408,"popularity":48.0,"aggregated_rating":91.5384615384615,"aggregated_rating_count":16,"total_rating":93.33664262310114,"total_rating_count":931,"rating_count":915,"games":[1985,1164,1020,19441,380,11270,1121,912,7323,3097],"tags":[1,19,21,23,268435461,268435487,536870976,536870981,536871006,536871044,536871071,536871073,536871133,536871134,536871195,536871251,536871292,536871422,536871470,536871535,536871701,536871889,536871937,536871945,536872032,536872184,536872229,536872232,536872234,536872245,536872285,536872315,536872352,536872511,536872622,536872647,536872715,536872748,536872758,536872847,536872883,536872952,536873097,536873192,536873326,536873584,536873712,536873810,536874014,536874182,536874345,536874398,536874452,536874706,536874745,536874822,536874834,536874906,536875057,536875097,536875133,536875151,536875154,536875157,536875162,536875194,536875196,536875199,536875216,536875229,536875280,536875304,536875305,536875320,536875340,536875342,536875345,536875358,536875385,536875420,536875437,536875438,536875453,536875456,536875483,536875491,536875501,536875523,536875526,536875527,536875532,536875535,536875538,536875540,536875545,536875549,536875553,536875554,536875572,536875623,536875624,536875668,536875669,536875695,536875731,536875741,536875755,536875762,536875765,536875777,536875786,536875803,536875808,536875819,536875830,536875831,536875837,536875886,536875900,536875902,536876062,536876073,536876109,536876171,536876176,536876188,536876220,536876227,536876229,536876241,536876251,536876262,536876322,536876329,536876332,536876337,536876363,536876384,536876397,536876414,536876417,536876439,536876466,536876483,536876499,536876502,536876505,536876520,536876577,536876584,536876587,536876596,536876652,536876670,536876703,536876706,536876712,536876727,536876735,536876759,536876760,536876797,536876911,536876978,536876987,536877015,536877040,536877047,536877081,536877109,536877122,536877128,536877151,536877157,536877166,536877169,536877173,536877203,536877221,536877283,536877288,536877289,536877290,536877309,536877319,536877321,536877329,536877332,536877352,536877374,536877383,536877393,536877439,536877453,536877501,536877516,536877532,536877560,536877625,536877643,536877649,536877657,536877688,536877762,536877780,536877782,536877790,536877809,536877910,536877942,536877960,536877976,536877977,536877985,536878009,536878027,536878032,536878057,536878141,536878215,536878247,536878263,536878267,536878315,536878317,536878331,536878415,536878468,536878512,536878515,536878541,536878562,536879045,536879069,536879233,536879734,536879750,536879766,536879806,536879824,536879908,536880073,536880195,536880240,536880278,536880319,536880400,536880449,536880573,536880622,536880680,536880721,536880732,536881102,536881103,536881389,536881602,536882193,536882489,536882490,536882491,536882492,536882493,536882494,536887629,536888127,536890349,536891386,1073741826],"developers":[401],"publishers":[45],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":60540,"normally":73580,"completely":173300},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[64,69,94,132,159,161,221,222,283,339,380,510,558,623,789,977,1025,1033,1120,1272,1317,1320,1322,1333,1373,1403,1440,1599,1710,1735,1803,1836,1846,1935,1971,2040,2185,2280,2414,2672,2800,2898,3102,3270,3433,3486,3540,3794,3833,3910,3922,3994,4145,4185,4221,4239,4242,4245,4250,4282,4284,4287,4304,4317,4368,4392,4393,4408,4428,4430,4433,4446,4473,4508,4525,4526,4541,4544,4571,4579,4589,4611,4614,4615,4620,4623,4626,4628,4633,4637,4641,4642,4660,4711,4712,4756,4757,4783,4819,4829,4843,4850,4853,4865,4874,4891,4896,4907,4918,4919,4925,4974,4988,4990,5150,5161,5197,5259,5264,5276,5308,5315,5317,5329,5339,5350,5410,5417,5420,5425,5451,5472,5485,5502,5505,5527,5554,5571,5587,5590,5593,5608,5665,5672,5675,5684,5740,5758,5791,5794,5800,5815,5823,5847,5848,5885,5999,6066,6075,6103,6128,6135,6169,6197,6210,6216,6239,6245,6254,6257,6261,6291,6309,6371,6376,6377,6378,6397,6407,6409,6417,6420,6440,6462,6471,6481,6527,6541,6589,6604,6620,6648,6713,6731,6737,6745,6776,6850,6868,6870,6878,6897,6998,7030,7048,7064,7065,7073,7097,7115,7120,7145,7229,7303,7335,7351,7355,7403,7405,7419,7503,7556,7600,7603,7629,7650,8133,8157,8321,8822,8838,8854,8894,8912,8996,9161,9283,9328,9366,9407,9488,9537,9661,9710,9768,9809,9820,10190,10191,10477,10690,11281,11577,11578,11579,11580,11581,11582,16717,17215,19437,20474],"themes":[1,19,21,23],"genres":[5,31],"expansions":[11790],"first_release_date":1371168000000,"pulse_count":46,"platforms":[9],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1371168000000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Jun-14","y":2013,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1371168000000,"region":2,"human":"2013-Jun-14","y":2013,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1371168000000,"human":"2013-Jun-14","y":2013,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"TLoU","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kdt90b2rbx4tmewaxur9.jpg",

is an action game in which players assume the role of Joel and Ellie, human survivors battling their way through a post-apocalyptic world. From a third-person perspective, players traverse through city ruins and use a variety of weapons (e.g., pistols, rifles, explosives, spiked bats, steel pipes, and blades) and melee attacks to fight off infected mutants and other human survivors. Players can also employ stealth kills (e.g., strangulations, pistol executions, stabbing attacks) and engage in extended combat sequences involving close-up camera angles and on-screen prompts. Screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects accompany the combat. Several attacks result in decapitations and dismemberment; body parts are depicted in some areas (e.g., chopping blocks). Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: a young character dying in a man's arms from gunshot wounds; adult characters being executed at point-blank range; an enemy getting interrogated and stabbed in the knee. During the course of the game, a character makes sexual remarks about an adult magazine (e.g., \"Whoa. How the hell would he even walk around with that thing\" and \"Oh why are these [pages] all stuck together\"). The words \"f**k,\"\"sh*t,\" and \"a*shole\" can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.naughtydog.com/games/the_last_of_us/"}]},{"id":11790,"name":"The Last of Us: Left Behind","slug":"the-last-of-us-left-behind","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-last-of-us-left-behind","created_at":1440526908609,"updated_at":1541582329582,"summary":"Left Behind is the first single player DLC for the critically acclaimed survival horror game The Last of Us, developed by Naughty Dog.","collection":864,"rating":82.159680917494,"popularity":4.0,"aggregated_rating":87.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":10,"total_rating":84.74650712541364,"total_rating_count":89,"rating_count":79,"game":1009,"games":[6036,26658,37016,19561,26192,37777,51524,13210,44076,19686],"tags":[1,19,21,268435461,268435487,536870981,536871071,536871073,536871195,536871384,536871530,536871937,536871945,536872032,536872315,536872366,536875057,536875385,536875819,536875831,536876169,536877955,536878541,536880732,536881101,536881102,536881103,536887629,536890348,536890349,536890350,536890351,1073741826],"developers":[401],"publishers":[13634],"category":2,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[69,159,161,283,472,618,1025,1033,1120,1403,1454,4145,4473,4907,4919,5257,7043,7629,9820,10189,10190,10191,16717,19436,19437,19438,19439],"themes":[1,19,21],"genres":[5,31],"first_release_date":1392336000000,"platforms":[45,9,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1392336000000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Feb-14","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1392336000000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Feb-14","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1392336000000,"human":"2014-Feb-14","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1392336000000,"region":8,"human":"2014-Feb-14","y":2014,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1406592000000,"region":2,"human":"2014-Jul-29","y":2014,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1406678400000,"region":1,"human":"2014-Jul-30","y":2014,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1406678400000,"region":3,"human":"2014-Jul-30","y":2014,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a5quab0lieijiexrdz0s.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a5quab0lieijiexrdz0s","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jfwgdapcizvytbglit60.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jfwgdapcizvytbglit60","width":1600,"height":900},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bqxf1b33uriybf9kjsef.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bqxf1b33uriybf9kjsef","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/obkj1tuicwitq4gl499p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"obkj1tuicwitq4gl499p","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/aodvuizxdwovqzkz9lru.jpg","cloudinary_id":"aodvuizxdwovqzkz9lru","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Intro Trailer","video_id":"yoKIprXeKiM"},{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"KX1EFh3UhfM"},{"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"R2bAQBUEP38"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/whzt4st5zbt7qcpwl3ul.jpg","cloudinary_id":"whzt4st5zbt7qcpwl3ul","width":1920,"height":2484},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http://thelastofus.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_of_Us:_Left_Behind"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us:_Left_Behind"}]},{"id":1352,"name":"Journey","slug":"journey","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/journey","created_at":1348913147061,"updated_at":1541609594744,"summary":"In Journey the player controls a robed figure in a vast desert, traveling towards a mountain in the distance. Other players on the same journey can be discovered, and two players can meet and assist each other, but they cannot communicate via speech or text and cannot see each other's names. The only form of communication between the two is a musical chime. This chime also transforms dull, stiff pieces of cloth found throughout the levels into vibrant red, affecting the game world and allowing the player to progress through the levels. The robed figure wears a trailing scarf, which when charged by approaching floating pieces of cloth, briefly allows the player to float through the air.\n\nThe developers sought to evoke in the player a sense of smallness and wonder, and to forge an emotional connection between them and the anonymous players they meet along the way. The music, composed by Austin Wintory, dynamically responds to the player's actions, building a single theme to represent the game's emotional arc throughout the story. Reviewers of the game praised the visual and auditory art as well as the sense of companionship created by playing with a stranger, calling it a moving and emotional experience. Journey won several \"game of the year\" awards and received several other awards and nominations, including a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media nomination for the 2013 Grammy Awards.","storyline":"Journey‍ '​s story is told wordlessly through in-game and pre-rendered cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. In the far distance looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins at the end of each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization, mirroring the player's journey.\n\nThe player continues to journey deeper into the remains of a once sprawling city at the base of the mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into and through the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic. This cinematic shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows glimpses of other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.","rating":85.7599272045739,"popularity":29.33333333333333,"aggregated_rating":93.8571428571429,"aggregated_rating_count":15,"total_rating":89.8085350308584,"total_rating_count":308,"rating_count":293,"games":[19150,56033,22387,24426,80916,28309,7344,36198,20342,55173],"tags":[1,268435463,268435464,268435468,268435487,268435488,536871029,536871208,536871444,536871529,536871904,536871939,536872010,536872349,536872622,536872961,536873111,536873249,536873455,536873712,536874022,536875083,536875099,536875151,536875157,536875194,536875208,536875271,536875276,536875322,536875350,536875437,536875453,536875610,536875638,536875695,536875809,536876015,536876023,536876069,536876185,536876229,536876445,536876540,536876714,536876751,536876808,536877057,536877238,536877384,536877549,536878284,536878381,536878488,536878512,536878531,536879091,536880854,536880863,536881002,536881123,536881414,536882058,536882159,536882425,536882616,536883374,536883375,536883555,536888127,536890230,1073741828,1073741826],"developers":[857],"publishers":[45],"game_engines":[174],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":10800,"normally":14180,"completely":20280},"player_perspectives":[2,4],"game_modes":[1,3],"keywords":[117,296,532,617,992,1027,1098,1437,1710,2049,2199,2337,2543,2800,3110,4171,4187,4239,4245,4282,4296,4359,4364,4410,4438,4525,4541,4698,4726,4783,4897,5103,5111,5157,5273,5317,5533,5628,5802,5839,5896,6145,6326,6472,6637,7372,7469,7576,7600,7619,8179,9942,9951,10090,10211,10502,11146,11247,11513,11704,12462,12463,12643,17215,19318],"themes":[1],"genres":[7,8,12,31,32],"first_release_date":1331596800000,"pulse_count":3,"platforms":[45,9,48],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1443744000000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Oct-02","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1443744000000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Oct-02","y":2015,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1437436800000,"region":1,"human":"2015-Jul-21","y":2015,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1437436800000,"region":2,"human":"2015-Jul-21","y":2015,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1331769600000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Mar-15","y":2012,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1331683200000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Mar-14","y":2012,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1331596800000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Mar-13","y":2012,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1331596800000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Mar-13","y":2012,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":48,"date":1437436800000,"region":8,"human":"2015-Jul-21","y":2015,"m":7}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ltdjvz1bhad8tdi07nj9.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ltdjvz1bhad8tdi07nj9","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ndmhmgw0qfxrc4ajvbpk.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ndmhmgw0qfxrc4ajvbpk","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cjt1dvmwyz5qr0xmrkrs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cjt1dvmwyz5qr0xmrkrs","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o5jocbesmzd3ytiyea1q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o5jocbesmzd3ytiyea1q","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xyqfksubtonzdgzcs8fl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xyqfksubtonzdgzcs8fl","width":1920,"height":1080}],"artworks":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/wbqiacfvz9tybz2xkvq6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"wbqiacfvz9tybz2xkvq6","width":1000,"height":640},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gvdadnl6c3wv1vfjoclx.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gvdadnl6c3wv1vfjoclx","width":800,"height":1030},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hzjyixtxakdbltne2ips.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hzjyixtxakdbltne2ips","width":1000,"height":740},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zl3fejxnms0vc5ggvugi.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zl3fejxnms0vc5ggvugi","width":1000,"height":580},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ekdes6jgjmwwfwlxpx6f.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ekdes6jgjmwwfwlxpx6f","width":1260,"height":710},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/osfmmqyc3nkf8ahkrw9b.jpg","cloudinary_id":"osfmmqyc3nkf8ahkrw9b","width":770,"height":1320},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hwnjiwo3mookxjxpuler.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hwnjiwo3mookxjxpuler","width":1200,"height":900},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rvvvakz9bfovqmz0iq9m.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rvvvakz9bfovqmz0iq9m","width":1000,"height":650},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/g5kj40c0drtes2eafmf7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"g5kj40c0drtes2eafmf7","width":1260,"height":930},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/spcbrvdv4jgittwiotrp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"spcbrvdv4jgittwiotrp","width":900,"height":1330},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/evqu3ma8mxwgpfirhyod.jpg","cloudinary_id":"evqu3ma8mxwgpfirhyod","width":1260,"height":950}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"61DZC-60x20"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"mU3nNT4rcFg"}],"cover":{"url":"//i
