game, and the fourth in the Forza Motorsport series. Like Sony's Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy emphasis is placed on making the cars drive and look as realistic as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from road cars to race cars. \n \nPlayers can utilize Kinect to look into a corner using a new head tracking feature. This allows them to look toward the apex of a corner or at nearby cars. The controller or steering wheel is used to control the car while Kinect is used independently for viewing around the driver. Players can also use Kinect as a game controller. In this setting the game automatically accelerates and decelerates the player's vehicle utilizing a modified version of the feature known as Auto Brake in Forza Motorsport 3. The steering is controlled by placing the players arms out as if controlling an invisible steering wheel. Kinect will allow the player to use voice commands to start races and navigate menus.","collection":448,"rating":84.5637271669689,"popularity":26.33333333333333,"aggregated_rating":85.7142857142857,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":85.1390064406273,"total_rating_count":37,"rating_count":26,"games":[8558,102,98,26948,97,7115,3047,7326,1600,561],"tags":[268435466,268435469,268435470,536871067,536871183,536871313,536871396,536872060,536872205,536872590,536872695,536873390,536874136,536874337,536874906,536875061,536875069,536875092,536875117,536875133,536875151,536875194,536875350,536875385,536875490,536875559,536875781,536875784,536875802,536876108,536876245,536876260,536876419,536876465,536876484,536876666,536876698,536876701,536876787,536876791,536876821,536877049,536877109,536877186,536877223,536877744,536877983,536878319,536879167,536879193,536879989,536880024,536880025,536880209,536880271,536880536,536880863,536880864,536880913,536880915,536880916,536880975,536881348,536881349,536881350,536881382,536881394,536881576,536881577,536881699,536881943,536882120,536882171,536882173,536882463,536882464,536882662,536882694,536882806,536882966,536883183,536883184,536883185,536883186,536883187,536883188,536883189,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[1022],"publishers":[53],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2,4],"keywords":[155,271,401,484,1148,1293,1678,1783,2478,3224,3425,3994,4149,4157,4180,4205,4221,4239,4282,4438,4473,4578,4647,4869,4872,4890,5196,5333,5348,5507,5553,5572,5754,5786,5789,5875,5879,5909,6137,6197,6274,6311,6832,7071,7407,8255,8281,9077,9112,9113,9297,9359,9624,9951,9952,10001,10003,10004,10063,10436,10437,10438,10470,10482,10664,10665,10787,11031,11208,11259,11261,11551,11552,11750,11782,11894,12054,12271,12272,12273,12274,12275,12276,12277],"genres":[10,13,14],"dlcs":[20824],"first_release_date":1318291200000,"platforms":[12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1318291200000,"human":"2011-Oct-11","y":2011,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/pdfijxfgemphacg9rdbr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"pdfijxfgemphacg9rdbr","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fz3u5ejvsc0qtwrfxmog.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fz3u5ejvsc0qtwrfxmog","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fdcpti596os4fk5f4tsw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fdcpti596os4fk5f4tsw","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"u0lXpp0U9mQ"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hncej5otfvc7szemnidf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hncej5otfvc7szemnidf","width":704,"height":840},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is a racing simulation game in which players can select and customize real-world cars, speed through realistic tracks, and choose racing events to add to their season calendar.

Groups of one-to-four players (i.e., the \"Survivors\") work cooperatively to battle the \"Infected\" zombies and reach safehouses at the end of each round/chapter. Player-Survivors use realistic pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, and assault rifles to kill hordes of zombies throughout the game; chainsaws, machetes, axes, and baseball bats can be used in frenetic close-quarter combat (i.e., melee attacks). In most cases, large sprays of blood shoot out of injured zombies, and they can stain the ground, walls—players' screen; for example, the \"Boomer\"-Infected explode in a shower of blood and bile when shot, which clouds players' view of the impending zombie swarm.   Bladed melee weapons and direct hits from rifles, shotguns, etc., cause decapitation or dismemberment; intense depictions include: piles of the Infected in a pool of blood along the roadside; intestines spilling out of abdominal wounds; zombie gibs shooting in all directions; charred innards; and skeletal bits and unclaimed torsos. While the litany of somewhat \"gruesome\" depictions attests to the Mature rating, the over-the-top onslaught is, in some ways,  mitigated  by the exaggerated menacing evil (camp?) of the drone-like zombie horde; the genre homage (horror, zombies, . . .  cricket paddle ) is palpable.

As players traverse through side-scrolling levels, they use various ninja weapons (e.g., swords, shuriken, darts, spiked mines) to kill human soldiers in hand-to-hand combat; some attacks trigger zoomed-in camera angles, and slashing/gushing sounds can be heard as enemies are stabbed or impaled. Stealth is a primary game mechanic, and players can execute various attack moves to avoid detection (e.g., descending from above to slice enemies' throats). Though combat and cutscenes are stylized and cartoonlike, kills are accompanied by exaggerated splashes of bright red blood. Cut scenes also depict acts of violence: a guard getting chopped in half; a villain impaling himself with a sword as blood pools underneath him. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.markoftheninja.com"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Ninja"},{"category":2,"url":"http://markoftheninja.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/214560"}],"external":{"steam":"214560"}},{"id":2670,"name":"Guitar Hero II","slug":"guitar-hero-ii","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/guitar-hero-ii","created_at":1374382440023,"updated_at":1537754059009,"summary":"Unleash your inner rock star!

is an action-adventure game in which players assume the role of Lara Croft, an explorer searching for an ancient artifact.

Players use stealth kills (e.g., stabbing enemies in the neck, cutting enemies' throats, strangling) to dispatch unsuspecting soldiers. Battles can be frenetic, with realistic gunfire, cries of pain, explosions, and large splashes of blood. Some sequences show Lara getting shot, beaten, or dramatically impaled by swords/spiked traps. One area depicts a horde of corpses burned and disfigured by a fire; severed limbs and heads are occasionally shown on the ground. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Strong language","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.tombraider.com/us/"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/391220"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/tombraider"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/TombRaider/"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider"},{"category":2,"url":"http://tombraider.wikia.com/wiki/Rise_of_the_Tomb_Raider"}],"external":{"steam":"391220"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"platform":49,"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":true,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false,"offlinecoopmax":0,"onlinecoopmax":0,"onlinemax":0,"offlinemax":0},{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]},{"id":3069,"name":"Forza Motorsport 3","slug":"forza-motorsport-3","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/forza-motorsport-3","created_at":1382299549033,"updated_at":1540928235705,"summary":"Forza Motorsport 3 is a racing video game developed for Xbox 360 by Turn 10 Studios.

is a third-person shooter in which players assume the role of Marcus Fenix, a soldier on a mission to save his father and battle an alien threat. Players use machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, and grenades to kill aliens and human soldiers in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, explosions, and large splashes of blood; some attacks result in dismemberment or decapitations that leave body parts and bloodstains on the ground. Finishing moves on weakened enemies depict more intense acts of violence: players can stomp on an enemy's head until it breaks apart; use a chainsaw-like weapon (i.e., Lancer) to slice creatures in half; and rip off an enemy's arm to use as a weapon.

Quest objectives sometimes involve using magic and hand-to-hand combat to defeat various creatures and enemy soldiers. Blood spray is depicted when enemies are slashed or injured during combat. Players can also gains 'points' and positive statistics for choosing good deeds over bad ones (e.g., \"Good points,\" \"Renown points,\" and a \"Good Reputation\") or based on the way they communicate with other characters: Lewd gestures/language such as hip thrusts and raising of the middle finger generate negative responses; flirting and blowing a kiss can garner positive responses from characters. With enough positive affinity, players can engage in sexual relations with males, females, or groups of characters. Players are rewarded for having multiple relations, and can choose to have unprotected sex, although sexual acts are never shown. Several characters are depicted drunk during cutscenes, while players can also consume beer and wine from various taverns. A screen-blurring effect connotes a character's drunken state.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Nudity of a sexual nature - Encouragement of the use of alcohol/tobacco - Content that teaches or encourages gambling\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":4},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fable_II"},{"category":2,"url":"http://fable.wikia.com/wiki/Fable_II"}]},{"id":495,"name":"Metro 2033","slug":"metro-2033","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metro-2033","created_at":1301478636000,"updated_at":1541492928799,"summary":"Set in the shattered subway of a post apocalyptic Moscow, Metro 2033 is a story of intensive underground survival where the fate of mankind rests in your hands.

is a first-person shooter, based on the novel  Metro 2033 ,   in which players engage in combat amid the shattered subway of a post-apocalyptic Moscow. Players assume the role of a young survivor who traverses the underground tunnels and above-ground remnants, battling humans and mutant creatures along the way. Players use pistols, shotguns, automatic rifles, crossbows, and pipe bombs to kill enemies lurking in the darkness. Melee attacks involve close-up hand-to-hand combat using knives and bayonets. Large plumes of dark blood splash out of humans and mutants when injured; blood may also stain walls, floors, and players' screen (the visor). Characters sometimes use profanity (e.g., \"f**k\" and \"sh*t\") in the dialogue. During the course of the game, players may encounter a prostitute character whose dialogue is sprinkled with sexual innuendo (\"You like what you see?,\" a \"special price,\" and \"I'll show you a good time,\" etc.); though players may follow the woman to her room and exchange currency, the sequence is pre-empted by an in-game event. The game includes a sequence in which players can approach a vendor who states, \"If you're here for the dope, I've got plenty\"; players' character can then inhale from a hookah and experience drug-like effects—blurry vision, losing balance, vomiting.","rating":6},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/metrovideogame"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/metrovideogame"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/metrovideogame"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/MetroVideoGame"},{"category":2,"url":"http://metrovideogame.wikia.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/286690"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_2033_(video_game)"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.4a-games.com/metro-2033.html"}]},{"id":2626,"name":"Burnout Revenge","slug":"burnout-revenge","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/burnout-revenge","created_at":1374113421247,"updated_at":1541534946220,"summary":"In Burnout Revenge, players compete in a range of racing game types with different aims. These take place within rush-hour traffic, and include circuit racing, Road Rage (where players cause as many rivals to crash as possible within a time limit, or until the player's car is wrecked), Burning Lap (a single-lap, single-racer time attack mode), Eliminator (a circuit race where every thirty seconds, the last-placed racer's car is detonated; the race continues until only one racer is left), and Crash (where the player is placed at a junction with the aim of accumulating as many \"Crash Dollars\" as possible). A new gameplay feature in Burnout Revenge is the ability to ram same-way small to medium traffic, known as \"traffic checking\", propelling the rammed car forward; the event in which a \"checked\" car hits a rival is considered as a Traffic Takedown. Traffic checking is the focus of a new race type, Traffic Attack (whereby a player must earn a set amount of Crash Dollars through checking traffic), which can be used later on. \nDuring these events, players have access to a limited amount of boost which is acquired through various dangerous driving techniques, including but not limited to driving on the wrong side of the road, tailgating opponents and drifting. Unique to the series is the concept of battling other rivals; unlike other video games in the racing genre, players are encouraged, and sometimes even required, to ram rival cars and cause traffic to crash. Causing a rival to crash is referred to as a \"Takedown\", rewarding the player by extending the length of their boost gauge and completely refilling it. In designated events, boost can also be used to activate a \"Crashbreaker\" during a crash, detonating the car and causing other nearby cars to crash. When the rival car takes the player down, the player will have to take the ultimate REVENGE by taking down the revenge rivals (which the arrow at the top of the car turned red) is referred to as \"Revenge Takedown\". \nIn the main single-player game mode, players compete in a world tour consisting of 169 events across three continents, divided into a series of 11 \"ranks\" (Rank 11 has no events). The ranks which a player has access to is determined by their \"Revenge Rank\", which increases after completing events. By increasing their Rank sufficiently, the player \"ranks up\" and unlocks the next rank of events. \nThere are 77 cars in the game, some of which can only be used for crash events. The SUVs and saloon cars are some of them. \nThe game also features support for multiplayer gameplay, both online and offline. In addition to the racing modes, the game features three types of Crash modes: Crash Battle (multiple players attempt a junction at the same time), Crash Party (players take turns at attempting junctions across several rounds), and Crash Tour (a golf-like version of Crash Party, with players attempting to accumulate a certain amount of Crash Dollars in as few attempts as possible; after the last round ends the player with the lowest score wins). \n \nThe Xbox 360 version of Burnout Revenge includes several new features and improves the graphics of the game to utilize the power of the next-gen console. The game includes 10 new crash junctions on the Crash Tour. It also includes a vastly improved online mode that introduces online Revenge Rivals. This system allows players to keep track of their number of times they have been taken out or have taken out any given player. \nThe new version also includes a new Burnout Clips feature, which allows to save 30 second clips of any offline race played and can be shared with other players over Xbox Live.","collection":515,"rating":75.5329372996043,"popularity":3.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":90.5,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":83.01646864980215,"total_rating_count":42,"rating_count":36,"games":[98,97,96,5761,99,101,620,3068,100,6203],"tags":[1,268435466,536870937,536871313,536871314,536871647,536872152,536872205,536872221,536872245,536872352,536872415,536872511,536872587,536872590,536872695,536873053,536873064,536873274,536873390,536874539,536874743,536874824,536875069,536875073,536875095,536875122,536875133,536875194,536875271,536875364,536875413,536875456,536875488,536875490,536875709,536875715,536875732,536875781,536875802,536875955,536876108,536876199,536876214,536876314,536876435,536876466,536876514,536876695,536876762,536876821,536876948,536877108,536877223,536877318,536877517,536877696,536877744,536877911,536877938,536877982,536877998,536878071,536878545,536879167,536879193,536880084,536880134,536880272,536880441,536880839,536880840,536881347,536881348,536881349,536881573,536881679,536882021,536882168,536882450,536882666,536883028,536883074,536883623,536883737,536883943,536884021,536884430,536885957,536885958,536886215,536886397,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[347],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[41],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[25,401,402,735,1240,1293,1309,1333,1440,1503,1599,1675,1678,1783,2141,2152,2362,2478,3627,3831,3912,4157,4161,4183,4210,4221,4282,4359,4452,4501,4544,4576,4578,4797,4803,4820,4869,4890,5043,5196,5287,5302,5402,5523,5554,5602,5783,5850,5909,6036,6196,6311,6406,6605,6784,6832,6999,7026,7070,7086,7159,7633,8255,8281,9172,9222,9360,9529,9927,9928,10435,10436,10437,10661,10767,11109,11256,11538,11754,12116,12162,12711,12825,13031,13109,13518,15045,15046,15303,15485],"themes":[1],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1126569600000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[11,12,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1143072000000,"region":5,"human":"2006-Mar-23","y":2006,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1142553600000,"region":1,"human":"2006-Mar-17","y":2006,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1141689600000,"region":2,"human":"2006-Mar-07","y":2006,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1127433600000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Sep-23","y":2005,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1126569600000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Sep-13","y":2005,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1129766400000,"region":5,"human":"2005-Oct-20","y":2005,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1127692800000,"region":3,"human":"2005-Sep-26","y":2005,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1127433600000,"region":1,"human":"2005-Sep-23","y":2005,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1126569600000,"region":2,"human":"2005-Sep-13","y":2005,"m":9}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Burnout\n","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Burnout 4"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fow9ntgqhhxjccdnbplo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fow9ntgqhhxjccdnbplo","width":790,"height":444},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ndk78tcf5gylr6y5w4of.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ndk78tcf5gylr6y5w4of","width":614,"height":346},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lgun3twbqsqsv16has5q.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lgun3twbqsqsv16has5q","width":512,"height":288}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"SH2Zyk5wb1A"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"9H-aqCWuCnQ"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/t0fltk6uv87cur3by6yb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"t0fltk6uv87cur3by6yb","width":256,"height":308},"esrb":{"rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for all persons.","rating":1},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_Revenge"},{"category":2,"url":"http://burnout.wikia.com/wiki/Burnout_Revenge"},{"category":1,"url":"http://burnoutrevenge.ea.com/"}]},{"id":478,"name":"The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings","slug":"the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings","created_at":1301403043000,"updated_at":1541559420728,"summary":"The second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration.

is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of Geralt, a monster slayer who must hunt down an assassin to clear his own name. As players complete quests, they use swords and magic spells to kill enemy soldiers and fantastical creatures (e.g., specters, harpies, spider-like monsters) in melee-style combat; attacks are often accompanied by slashing sounds and screams of pain. Blood-splatter effects occur when enemies are hit, and damage sometimes results in dismemberment or decapitation—blood stains and body parts occasionally appear in the environment. Other cutscenes depict gore and more intense acts of violence: a close-up view of a severed head; a restrained woman's eyes getting gouged out (off-screen); a character being castrated (not depicted) before his throat is slit. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted topless; there is also a fleeting image of pubic hair as a woman dives into the water. Players can initiate brief cutscene sequences that depict varying degrees of sexual activity: a topless woman rocking on top of man; a man caressing a woman's back; a man pushing up against a woman's posterior—sexual moaning sounds can be heard, though the camera cuts away from explicit sexual acts. Some sequences depict a cocaine-like substance being cut into lines; another scene shows a man's back as he snorts the substance. Language such as \"f**k,\"\"sh*t,\" and \"c*nt\" can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/20920"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/witchergame"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/thewitcher"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings"},{"category":2,"url":"http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings"},{"category":1,"url":"http://thewitcher.com/witcher2/"}]}]
